      "title": "Isaiah's Vision",
      "content": "In the year that King Uzziah died, I beheld my Lord seated on a high and lofty throne; and the skirts of His robe filled the Temple. Seraphs stood in attendance on Him. Each of them h ad s ix wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his legs, and with two he would fly. And one would call to the other, \"Holy, holy, holy! The Lord of Hosts! His presence fills all the earth!\" The doorposts would shake at the sound of the one who called, and the House kept filling with smoke. I cried, \"Woe is me; I am lost! For I am a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips; yet my own eyes have beheld the King Lord of Hosts.\" Then one of the seraphs flew over to me with a live coal, which he had taken from the altar with a pair of tongs. He touched it to my lips and declared, \"Now that this has touched your lips, your guilt shall depart and your sin be purged away.\" Then I heard the voice of my Lord saying, \"Whom shall I send? Who will go for us?\" And I said, \"Here am I; send me.\"",
      "commentary": "This biblical vision of Isaiah is extremely important in forming elementary concepts about the nature of God, of heaven, and of the role of the angels. Here God is envisioned as a king whose dwelling\" place is not a palace, but a temple. Which temple is this? The presence of the angels,jvvhose fun ction is to glorify God, strongly suggests it is the heavenly temple. Just this one passage, then, establishes the existence of heaven as a place on high inhabited by God and the angels, with His home in the heavenly Temple. This vision of Isaiah thus serves as a blueprint for subsequent myths about God and heaven. Details about the geography of heaven, about the names and roles of the angels, and, above all, about God's role on high, are embellished in rabbinic texts and in the Pseudepigrapha, the noncanonical books of the Bible, especially in the books of Enoch. Later the heavenly geography is further developed in the kabbalistic and Hasidic literature. For an example of a rabbinic elaboration, see \"God's Throne of Glory,\" p. 4. Isaiah's own role in this vision — in which a seraph touches his mouth with a glowing stone that takes away guilt from his \"unclean lips\" — also establishes a pattern of interaction between humans and the divine realm, as well as the motif of a healing stone. This motif is also found in the Talmud in the myth of a glowing stone that the patriarch Abraham was said to have worn around his neck. Anyone who peered into the stone was healed ( B . Bava Batra 16b). See \"The Tzohar,\" p. 85. A close variant of Isaiah's vision, in which God is also portrayed as seated upon a heavenly throne, is found in Daniel 7:9-10. See \"Daniel's Night Vision,\" following.",

      "content": "As I looked on, thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took His seat. His garment was like white snow, and the hair of His head was like lamb's wool. His throne was tongues of flame; its wheels were blazing fire. A river of fire streamed forth before Him; thousands upon thousands served Him; myriads upon myriads attended Him; the court sat and the books were opened. As I looked on, in the night vision, one like a human being came with the clouds of heaven; he reached the Ancient of Days and was presented to Him. Dominion, glory, and kingship were given to him; all peoples and nations of every language must serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that shall not pass away, and his kingship, one that shall not be destroyed.",
      "commentary": "One way of reading this crucial dream vision of Daniel is to see it as the enthronement of two divine manifestations. In one God is identified as the Ancient of Days (Atik Yomaya); in the other, as a human being. In this interpretation God can be maiufested as a young man or as an old man. Some rabbinic texts, such as Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, ba-Hodesh 5:20-30, discuss how God can sometimes appear as an old man and sometimes as a young man. See \"God's Disguises,\" p. 16. This myth also can be read in a completely different way, where the human figure is enthroned as a second divinity, as is found in Jewish Gnosticism. Read this way, this myth serves as the template for a series of enthronement myths. See \"The Enthronement of Adam,\" p. 131, \"The Metamorphosis and Enthronement of Enoch,\" p. 156, \"Jacob the Divine,\" p. 366, \"The Enthronement of Moses,\" and \"King David is Crowned in Heaven,\" p. 395. Here the Ancie nt of Days — one of the names of God — is seated upon His throne, while the youngeTfigure is given ^everlastingdominion/' which appears to be an enthronement. This pattern of the enthronement of a second divine figure in Judaism, while surprising because of the expectations of monotheism, is repeated many times in subsequent Jewish literature, where enthronement accounts are found for Adam, Jacob, Moses, and David, as well as for Enoch, who is transformed into the angel Metatron. These texts establish a pattern of Jewish Gnosticism in which a demiurgic figure is invested with divine powers.",

      "content": "God sits in the center of a high and exalted throne, exceedingly majestic, suspended in the highest heaven, Aravot. Some say that one-half of the throne is made of fire, and the other half of snow. Others say that the entire throne consists of fire. A resplendent crown of glory rests upon God's head, and upon His forehead are written the four letters of His Name, YHVH. God's eyes overlook all of the earth; on His right is life, on His left, death. In His hand is a sce pter of fire . Fire surrounds the Throne of Glory, and beneath it sapphires glow. The throne stands upon four legs, with four holy creatures attached to it. On each side are four faces and four wings. Clouds of glory surround the throne, filled With six-winged seraphim singing praises to the Lord. God's Throne of Glory is fused with a chariot of fire. It has never set foot on the floor of the seventh heaven, but hovers like a bird there. Each day the Throne of Glory sings a hymn before God, and thrice daily the throne prostrates itself before God, saying, \"God of Israel, sit upon me in glory, for Your burden is most dear to me and does not weigh me down.\" Rivers issue forth from under the Throne of Glory: rivers of joy, rivers of rejoicing, rivers of jubilation, rivers of love, rivers of friendship. They strengthen themselves and pass through the gates of the seventh heaven.",
      "commentary": "While God sits upon His throne, high and exalted, and looks down upon the earth, the wheels of the chariot roll through the heavens, causing lightning and thunder, as well as earthquakes. The chariot is led through the heavens by a swift cherub, who flies upon wings of the wind.",

Then God will set the place of the righteous closer to his throne than the place of the ministering angels. There are many scenarios for what will take place in the messianic era. Here God's throne is envisioned descending to the middle of the firmament. From there, it would be visible to everyone on earth, so that they would be able to see God's glory. The myth also stresses the ultimate importance of the righteous to God, who will be closer to His throne than will the angels.

      "content": "God wears a crown on His head. All the letters of the Hebrew alphabet adorn that crown. That crown has two staves, and between them is a precious stone, with the words \"Israel, My people; Israel My people is mine\" engraved on it. For the name of that crown is Israel. So too are inscribed the words, My beloved is clear skinned and ruddy , preeminent among ten thousand. His head is finest gold , his locks are curled and black as a raven. His eyes are like doves by watercourses bathed in milk , set by a brimming pool (S. of S. 5:10-12). Rabbi Akiba defended the inclusion of the Song of Songs in the Bible, saying \"The whole world existed for the day on which The Song of Songs was given to it. For all the Writings are holy, but this is the holy of holies\" ( Song of Songs Rabbah 1:11). That words from the Song of Songs are engraved on God's crown confirms Rabbi Akiba's assertion about the exceptional holiness of that book. The letters of the Hebrew alphabet are engraved in the crown, and this serves to explain the primal power of the letters, which, tradition holds, were used in the creation of the world. See \"The Letters of the Alphabet,\" p. 250. The size of God's crown is given in the Sefer ha-Komah as 500,000 by 500,000 parasangs. By contrast, the circumference of God's head is given in the same text as 3,003,033 parasangs. A similar crown is described as being worn by Metatron, the supreme angel, in 3 Enoch 13.",

      "content": "Three times each day the prayers of Israel ascend on high. When all of Israel has finished praying, what happens to their prayers? They thread their way to Paradise, to the highest heaven, where they are gathered by the angel Sandalphon, the angel appointed over prayers. Sandalphon collects all the prayers that have been offered in all the synagogues, and weaves them into garlands of prayer that he places upon the head of God, to wear on His Throne of Glory. That is why it is said that God is crowned with the prayers of Israel.",
      "commentary": "The idea that God wears a crown is a natural development from the concept of God as king. Since kings were the highest, most powerful human figures, God was viewed as the ultimate king. So too does God have a throne, the Throne of Glory, and a crown. The notion of God wearing a crown is also reinforced by the biblical verse: and a splendid crown upon Your head (Ezek. 16:12). Here, though, the crown is formed in a wonderful way. The angel Sandalphon, charged with gathering the prayers of Israel, first collects the prayers and then weaves them into crowns of prayer. In some versions the angel puts the crown directly on God. In others, the angel pronounces an adjuration that causes the crown to rise on its own and settle on God's head.",

      "title": "The Ten Sefirot",
      "content": "Ten is the number of the ineffable sefirot, ten and not nine, ten and not eleven. Each of the sefirot has the appearance of a flash of lightning. Their origin is beyond human sight, their unfolding to the end of time. Each sefirah has its own name, and this name can invoke angels and draw down the word of God. As they rush forth and return, they bear the divine word with them as a messenger carries a message. Each sefirah reaches up to the Source of being and down to the created world. Each has vast regions bound to it, boundless and neverending, an abyss of good and evil. From His throne, God eternally rules over them. The y are great mysteries of Gn H as it is said. The secret things belong to Yahzveh (Deut. 29:28), and in them God conceals Himself from human beings. Through them God rules secret worlds that have not heen revealed, as well as worlds that have been revealed. He binds the sefirot together and unites them. He has prepared garments for them, fromjvh^ fly into human beings. The sefirot are the channels through which God rules and interacts with all universes — those accessible to the human eye and those beyond human understanding, even beyond prophecy. God js hidden wi thin the sefiro t. From them comes all existence — through them, from the TugKest sphere, mamTests theTiuman being. GodJsJh e m ystery of mysteries. No thought can grasp God at all. In God there is no likeness or image of anything within or without. But since God is in the sefirot, whoever separates any one of these ten from the others, it is as if he had made a division in God. TheJen _sefirot emanated from the ultima te, unknowable God, known as Ein Sof (the InfiniteDne), at the moment ot Creation. They pour down energy, level after level, at last manifesting into a state of being, a container that receives the divine life flowing into it from the other sefirot. The function of the sefirot is a holographic reality, repeated endlessly, macro and microcosmlcally. ButgenericalljnEat container is the tenth sefirah, Malkhut, which is also known as Shekhina h and Knesset Yisrael, the soul root Israel (which manifests in the form of the Jewish people). All ten sefirot function as a unit to channel the divine energy. They are the conduits for ultimate good; yet paradoxically intimated within the very nature of the sefirot is the first hint of constriction that ultimately manifests as evil. Therefore, any at tempt tpjn^nipulate these forces is co nsidered tampering with di vinity i tself, and obstructing the flow of divinity througFTall the worlds. In more classical terminology, whoever separates any one of these ten from the others is considered as though he had made a division within the Divine. The sefirot, representing the transition from s uper-being to being, a r e, in de scendi n g order: (1) Keter, Crown, the power that comes from the Transcendent (2) Hokhmah , Wisdom emerging from the ineffable, (3) Binah, the Understanding that develops, (4) Hesed, the generous Lovingkindness that flows downward, (5) Gevurah, the necessary Power that holds back and channels that Lovingkindness, (6) Tiferet, the Harmonious Beauty that blends Lovingkindness and Might, (7) Netzah, Vanquishment, the giving of Lovingkindness in a dominant fashion, (8) Hod , Glory, the holding back of Might in a more passive fashion, (9) Yesod, the Foundation into which all these energies pour, where they are all blended into a more accessible form, and (10) Malkhut , Regency, the actualized guidance and rule of the Infinite One. Malkhut also represents the Shekhinah, the feminine aspect of God. The term \"sefirah\" seems to have been first used in the ancient kabbalistic text, the Sefer Yetzirah , the Book of Formation. Later kabbalistic teachings go into great detail describing the interactions of the ten sefirot, and the sefirot are one of the primary topics of kabbalah, particularly in the Zohar (which usually alludes to them in a veiled, symbolic fashion). The Second Introduction to Tikkunei ha-Zohar contains a brief mystical essay attributed to the prophet Elijah that describes the nature of each sefirah. This selection is still recited by devout Jews at the beginning of the daily prayers. See the diagram of the ten sefirot, p. 529.",

At first there arose in Him the potential to emanate from His own essence all the worlds that existed potentially within Him. When the will of the Infinite Being decided to create. He brought existence from potential to actuality. First the Infinite Being emanated its sefirot, through which its actions are performed. In this way all worlds were brought into being; indeed, all that exists came into being from Him, from the depths of the earth to the loftiest heavens. This Infinite Being, known as Ein Sof fills all the worlds of time and space. Both the heavens above and the earth below are equally filled with His light. There is no place empty of Him in the upper or the lower worlds. Ein Sof, literally meaning \"endless,\" is the Godhead, the oldest aspect of God, from which all of the ten sefirot, the ten numerals or emanations of God, proceed. This part of God is considered to be unknowable and above time; indeed, no speculation about Ein Sof is permitted. Here Rabbi Levi Yitzhak of Berditchev (1740-1810) makes the important point that in the universe it is God alone who does not have a beginning. See \"The Ten Sefirot,\" p. 7.",

These are six of the forms, and the seventh is God's Bride, about whom it is written, so that they become one flesh (Gen. 2:24). This is an example of a sefirotic myth, in which God's body is said to correspond to that of man's. The ten sefirot, in descending order, are: 1. Keter (Crown); 2. Hokhmah (Wisdom); 3. Binah (Understanding); 4. Hesed (Lovingkindness); 5. Gevurah (Power); 6. Tiferet (Beauty); 7. Netzah (Victory); 8. Hod (Splendor); 9. Yesod (Foundation); 10. Malkhut (Sovereignty). The seven forms referred to are the seven lower sefirot. The last of these is Malkhut, which represents the Shekhinah, the feminine aspect of God . Just as God is male and female and isnot complete without his feminine aspect, so man is incomplete without a woman. This diagram can be found on p. 529.

Maimonides / view of God is rock-solid monotheism: there is only one God, who is f also the Creator of everything that exists, including the angels and other heavenly , rt t beings. However, Maimonides denies the corporeality of God, which is assumed in many myths. Maimonides's statement that \"God has no body at all\" is quite defini; tive. Indeed, one way of reading this is not as a myth, but as an antimyth, intended to limit further mythic development. Maimonides specifically does not want to describe God in mythic terms, but as a Deity whose laws have to be interpreted and obeyed.",

He ponders how to create the deep, how to create the heights, how to create the pillars of the clouds, how to create the foundation of the world. And from evening until morning God descends from the Throne of Glory and rides upon sparks of fire and arranges the orders of the new worlds with his fingers. He positions the upper worlds opposite the lower ones, and the lower worlds opposite the upper. Others say that for the first three hours of the day God is engaged in the study of Torah. During the next three hours God sits in judgment of the world. During the next three hours He feeds the whole world, from homed buffalo to vermin. During the next three hours some say He plays with Leviathan, while others insist that He sits and teaches school children. Still others say that He blesses bridegrooms, adorns brides, visits the sick, buries the dead, and recites the blessing for mourners. And what does God do at night? He rides a cherub of light and floats in 18,000 worlds, listening to heavenly songs. Here are two accounts about how God spends His day. The first, from Midrash Aleph Bet, shows that God has two primary modes, one of contemplation, which takes place during the day, and one of action, which takes place at night. Note that this is the reverse of human behavior, which uses the day for action and the night for con* templation. This myth echoes many biblical passages about God's work of Creation, such as Psalms 33:6: By the word ofYahweh the heavens were made, and all their host by the breath of His mouth. The second account of God's day, from the Talmud, divides the first 12 hours of the day into four three-hour units. During these 12 hours, God puts in a very active day, devoting Himself to study, judgment, sustenance of the world, and, for relaxation, either playing with Leviathan or teaching children. But here God's second 12 hours are spent in floating on a cherub through thousands of worlds or in listening to the song of the living creatures, both quite passive roles. Since the whole myth creates parallels between God's day and that of a person, this passive role resembles something like God's dreamtime. In both mythic accounts, God moves from active to passive roles, and He is required to divide His time much as do His children, who must find time to sustain themselves and their families while also properly devoting themselves to the study of Torah. Thus both views of God's day are quite reassuring, for they demonstrate the kabbalistic principle of \"as above, so below,\" in which the upper worlds and lower worlds are mirrors of each other, and even God has a schedule that He must follow.",

Not even the ministering angels who tend God's Throne of Glory know where God can be found, nor do the heavenly creatures who carry the Throne, for God has encircled Himself with darkness and cloud all around, as it is said. He made darkness His screen (Ps. 18:12). Indeed, some say that the true meaning of the verse You hid Your face (Ps. 30:8) is that God is hidden from Himself.",
      "commentary": "This myth of a hidden God is based on the verse He that dwells in the secret place, the most high, in the shade of God He will linger (Ps. 91:1). Other verses that confirm this view of a hidden God are Psalm 30:8: You hid Your face, and Isaiah 64:6: For You have hidden Your face from us . This might be regarded as a dark myth about the absence of God, or it might be seen as a metaphor for the hidden nature of God: just as no person knows where his soul is located within himself, so too does no one know the place of God. The most profound development of a hidden God is found in kabbalah, where God's hiddenness is directly related to God as Ein Sof, which literally meaning \"endless.\" This is the infinite God, the unknowable God, the God above the realm of the sefirot. The Zohar states, for example, that \" Ein Sof does not abide being known\" (Zohar 3:26b). Masekhet Hekhalot 3 offers a strange reason for God having hidden Himself: \"So that the ministering angels cannot be nourished by the splendor of the Shekhinah, nor by the splendor of His throne, nor by the splendor of His glory, nor by the splendor of His kingship.\" In this view God is inaccessible to the angels and is determined to withhold his glory from them. This conclusion follows the kabbalistic concept of Ein Sof, where the ultimate nature of God must always remain unknown. In Likutei Moharan Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav (1772-1811) interprets You hid Your face (Ps. 30:8) as meaning that God has turned his back on the Jewish people during the Exile: \"In our Exile the face of God is hidden. All our prayers and requests are a result of God's having turned His back to us. We want Him to turn back His face, as it is said. Turn to me\" (Ps. 86:16).",

      "title": "The Contraction Of God",
      "content": "Before God created the world, God's light filled all of existence. There was no vacant place, no empty space or void. Everything was filled with the light of the Infinite. Nor did that light have any beginning or end, and that is why it is called the infinite light. When God decided to create worlds. He contracted Himself, and left an empty space in which to emanate and bring the worlds into being. He contracted His essence into no more than a handbreadth, and at that instant darkness spread everywhere, for God's infinite light had been withdrawn. How did God create this world? Like a person who draws in his breath, so that the smaller might contain the larger, so did God contract His light into a handsbreadth, and the world was left in darkness. And in that darkness God carved large boulders and hewed rocks to clear wondrous paths of wisdom. The primary source for this myth of God's contraction comes from Rabbi Hayim Vital's (1542-1640) Etz Hayim (The Tree of Life). Vital was the primary disciple of Rabbi Isaac Luria, known as the Ari (1534-1572). The purpose of this myth is to explain how, since God's presence (or infinite light) pervaded the universe, there could be room for Creation. The answer is this contraction of God, known as tzimtzum. Tzimtzum is the preliminary stage of the famous creation myth of the Ari. See \"The Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks,\" p. 122. The infinite light (or Ein Sof) is said to have pervaded all of existence until God contracted Himself. Hayim Vital gives the precise location of the contraction, saying that the light, which formed a circle, contracted itself at its midpoint, in the exact center of the light, withdrawing to the circumference, leaving an empty space in between. The World of Emanation and all other worlds exist inside that circle, with the light of the infinite surrounding it. Vital's explanation is as follows: Know that before the emanations were manifested and the creatures were formed, there was a simple ethereal light that filled all of existence. There was no empty space at all, such as an empty atmosphere or a vacuum, for everything was filled with that infinite light. This light had nothing in the sense of a beginning or an end, for everything was one simple light equally distributed. This is called the infinite light. And when in His simple will the desire arose to create the worlds and manifest the emanations, to bring to light the perfection of his deeds, names, and attributes— which was the reason for the creation of the worlds— behold God then contracted Himself in the middle point of Himself, in the very center of His light. And He contracted that light, and it was withdrawn to the sides around the middle point. Then there remained an empty space, an atmosphere, and a vacuum surrounding the very middle point. And behold, this contraction ( tzimtzum ) was equally distributed around that empty middle point in such a way that the vacuum was circular on all its sides equally. The notion that God's presence fills the world is found in the biblical account of the Tent of Meeting, which Moses was unable to enter because God's presence had filled it entirely: The cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the Presence of the Lord filled the Tabernacle. Moses could not enter the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud had settled upon it and the Presence of the Lord filled the Tabernacle (Exod. 40:34-35). Likewise, this idea is found in the verse \" For I fill both heaven and earth \" says Yahweh (Jer. 23:24). About this King David is quoted as saying, \"Just as the soul fills the body, so God fills the whole world\" (Lev. Rab. 4:8). At the same time, the notion that God can contract His presence and concentrate it in a single place is based on the tradition that God was able to speak to Moses from between the two staves of the Ark of the Tabernacle (Genesis Rabbah 4:4). Even more explicit is Exodus Rabbah 34:1, where God says, \"I will descend and concentrate My presence within one square cubit of the Ark.\" Thus, when God wishes He can fill heaven and earth, as it is said. Do I not fill heaven and earth? (Jer. 23:24), and when He so desires. He can speak to Moses from between the staves of the Ark. For Dov Ber, the Maggid of Mezritch, tzimtzum took place in this world, as God contracted His infinite light, but in the higher world God's light is unrestricted. He found confirmation of this in Isaiah 60:19, No longer shall you need the sun for light by day. . . For the Lord shall be your light everlasting, your God shall be your glory (Maggid Devarav le-Ya'akov 184).",

      "title": "Adam Kadmon",
      "content": "Adam Kadmon, the supernal man, was the beginning of all beginnings, the most ancient of all primordial beings. Adam Kadmon preceded all other creations, and from Adam Kadmon all other worlds spread forth. He was the first creation to fill the void created by God's contraction, consisting of ten emanations in the form of circular wheels, one inside the other, which came forth, followed by the form of a single human being. And that was Adam Kadmon, the primordial man, a completely spiritual being. When it is said that man was created in the image of God, this refers to the form of Adam Kadmon. For God Himself has no form or image. Filled with the light of the infinite, Adam Kadmon extends from one end of the empty space God created to the other. Some say that this infinite light emerges from the openings and apertures of the skull of Adam Kadmon, from his ears, his nose, his mouth and his eyes. Others say that the light issues from his mouth, his navel, and his phallus. The lights that issue from his mouth reach into all comers of the world, although only the points of the lights, called the branches, go forth, while the roots remain within him. From the forehead of Adam Kadmon tremendous lights shine forth in rich and complex patterns, some taking the form of letters and words of the Torah. These lights come forth from where the box of tefillin is placed. All the lights that shine forth from Adam Kadmon eventually come together into a single circle. This light is so great that it can only be received if transmitted through the filter of his being. Still, the light that remains inside Adam Kadmon is far greater than the light that emerges from him. Adam Kadmon contains thousands of myriads of worlds. The first four of these to come forth from Adam Kadmon are the Four Worlds, the worlds of Emanation ( Atzilut ), Creation ( Beriah ), Formation ( Yetzirah ), and Action ( Asiyah ). The creation of Adam Kadmon and of these other, lower worlds had a beginning in time, when they came into being. But",
      "commentary": "this is not true of the Infinite One, who has no beginning or end. The complex concept of Adam Kadmon serves both as a mythic figure and as an abstract kabbalistic function. The term ''Adam Kadmon\" means \"primordial man,\" and Adam Kadmon is understood to be the spiritual prototype of man, a kind of cosmic soul. At the same time, the figure of Adam Kadmon can also be recognized as an anthropomorphic manifestation of God, a male deity assuming the shape and features of a human being. The concept likely evolved from the older idea — prominent in Philo's writings — of a heavenly man who was created at the same time, or prior to, the earthly Adam. See \"The Heavenly Man,\" p. 124. Like Philo's concept of the heavenly man, the existence and nature of Adam Kadmon are based on the verse And God created man in His image (Gen. 1:27). In Philo's view, the heavenly man is the pure image of God, and in the kabbalistic view, especially as found in Lurianic kabbalah, Adam Kadmon is said to contain every image of man that would ever exist — thus he is an archetype or prototype of man. According to Yosef ibn Tabul in Kerem Hayah leShlomo, Adam Kadmon, like the earthly Adam, transgressed in some fashion. At the same time, there are major differences between the heavenly man and Adam Kadmon. While the heavenly man seems like a purely mythic concept, Adam Kadmon, despite its anthropomorphic qualities, is understood to serve \"as a kind of interface between the Infinite Creator and the finite creation\" (Aryeh Kaplan, Inner Space , p. 23). It appears that Kaplan would entirely deny the apparent mythic nature of Adam Kadmon: \"One of the main tasks of the Kabbalah tradition was to allow us to interpret these anthropomorphisms. It is universally agreed that they are to be understood allegorically rather than literally\" ( Inner Space , pp. 111-112). The myth of Adam Kadmon is directly related to that of God's contraction. See the prior myth, \"The Contraction of God.\" By contracting Himself, God created space in the universe for the universe to be created. Adam Kadmon is God's first creation, which fills the empty space. While Adam Kadmon is said to take the shape of a human, it may well be that this is intended in much the same way various constellations of stars are identified in astrology. Thus Adam Kadmon could be understood as a constellation in the shape of a man, just as the Pleiades are identified as seven sisters and Orion as a man who is pursuing them. For Adam Kadmon is clearly intended to represent a cosmic realm. Indeed, Adam Kadmon represents the \"inconceivable universe,\" as Jorge Luis Borges describes it in \"The Aleph\" ( Collected Fictions , pp. 284). At the same time Adam Kadmon is a cosmic metaphor, representing a stage in the creation of the world as well as the universe itself. Above all, Adam Kadmon is part of the complex kabbalistic theory of God's emanation of the world, containing the ten sefirot. Likewise, in Etz Hayim, Derush Igulim ve-Yosher 4:28a:l-15, Hayim Vital adds a clear disclaimer explaining that the human qualities attributed to Adam Kadmon should not be understood literally: \"It should be clear that there is no body in the higher realm. As for all the images we use, it is not because it is actually so, but only so that one can understand higher spiritual matters that cannot be comprehended by the human understanding.\" Nevertheless, there remain distinct mythic qualities associated with Adam Kadmon that reflect his role as the first primordial being that God created, who is described as taking the form of a human being. The meaning of his name — primordial man — and its obvious link with the earthly Adam, and the description of his body, where considerable emphasis is placed on his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears, all combine to suggest that Adam Kadmon is a demiurgic figure. At the same time, in terms of kabbalistic cosmology, Adam Kadmon functions as a conduit, shaped like a human, through which the light of the infinite (Or Ein Sof) passes before being emanated into the Four Worlds. These are the World of Emanation (Atzilut), The World of Creation {Beriah) f The World of Formation ( Yetzirah ), and the World of Action (Asiyah). These worlds correspond to the senses of vision, hearing, smell, and speech. The ten emanations that Adam Kadmon contains are the ten sefirot. Thus, from a kabbalistic perspective, Adam Kadmon is not only a primordial being, but a cosmic forcefield that contains the creative forces of existence. See a diagram of the Tree of Life on p. 529. The role of God in the myth of Adam Kadmon is very interesting. God appears to have multiple roles. On the one hand God is the Infinite One, known as Ein Sof, meaning \"Endless,\" who creates Adam Kadmon, and the rest of creation emanates from Adam Kadmon, who contains the ten sefirot. But since Ein Sof is completely unknowable, Adam Kadmon is the first manifestation of divine existence that can be perceived.",

This l ight is calledthe Hnly Sp irit ~ The Holy Spirit consis ts of three parts. Spirit, Voice an d Word.. From Spirit God produced air, and formedt wenty-two sound s: the letters of the alphabet. From air He formed waters, and from chaos and void he made mire and clay, and from them He formed the foundation of existence. And from the waters God formed fire, and made a Throne of Glory for Himself, where He is surrounded by the ministering angels. That is why it is written. Who makes His angels spirits and His ministers a flaming fire (Ps. 104:4). That is how air, water, and fire were created — fire above, water be low, and air between them. The Holy Spirit embraced all the patriarchs, kings7and prophets. Through the Holy Spirit, Adam was able to see the future generations, until the End of Days. Enoch was taken into heaven in a chariot, and when he returned to earth for 30 days, the Holy Spirit spoke through him, and he revealed the secrets of heaven. The Holy Spirit spoke through Noah, and he warned of the coming Flood. “ — After God's covenant with Abraham, he was possessed by the Holy Spirit at all times. Abraham saw with the Holy Spirit that David would descend from him. As for Isaac, the angels on high took Isaac and brought him to the heavenly academy of Shem and Eber, where he studied for three years, and when he returned, he saw the world through the eyes ofjhe Holy Spirit. That is why his own sight grew dim. Jacob discovered the Holy Spirit when Keclreamed ofthe ladder reaching from earth to heaven, with angels ascending and descending on it. With the aid of the Holy Spirit, Joseph was able to divine the future and interpret dreams. So too did the Holy Spirit inhabit King David as if he were a vessel for the Psalms that poured forth from him. And in his old age, just before his death, the Holy Spirit descended on King Solomon and he composed the books attributed to him: Proverbs, the S ong of Songs, and Ecclesi astes. ~AlTof the Drophets spoke through the Holy Spirit. Ezekiel was fully possessed of the Holy Spirit when he saw the Divine Chariot, and Isaiah saw with the eyes of the Holy Spirit when he had a vision of God seated on a high and exalted throne. So too was the Scroll of Esther written with the Holy Spirit.",
      "commentary": "Some say that from the day the Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, the power of prophecy was taken from the prophets and given to the sages. After the demise of the last prophets, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, the Holy Spirit departed from Israel, as it is said. And the lifebreath returns to God (Eccles. 12:7). After that, the people were informed of the unknown by means ot a heavenly voice And when the heavenly voice could no longer be heard, letters fell from heaven into the hands of those intended to receive them. But for a long time no such letters have fallen, and heaven has been silent. The Holy Spirit is the known as the Ruah ha-Kodesh. The key motif of the myth of the Holy Spirit is that it departed from Israel after the last prophets. Here ruah, which means both \"spirit\" and \"breath,\" is understood to refer to the Holy Spirit. The heavenly voice is known as a bat kol, the daughter of a voice. There are a number of rabbinic reports about hearing such a voice speak from on high. One of the most famous refers to the voice that is said to go forth in heaven 40 days before a child is bom. This heavenly voice is heard by the angels and by some extraordinary sages, such as the Ari. See \"God makes Matches,\" p. 66.",

Four gatherings of angels sang praises before Him, and the waters rose up and touched His throne.

He sees behind Him that which has yet to happen. Nothing, not even the future, is hidden from God. Even before a person has crystallized a thought in his mind, God already knows it. God sees what is in the light and what is in the dark. There are no secret places for people to hide where God will not see them. Even those who transgress with utmost secrecy in the innermost chambers of their dwellings, in a place of darkness and in an area completely hidden — even those will go down to Gehenna, for God sees them. God is vigilant both day and night. And on Rosh ha-Shanah all creatures are reviewed by the eyes of God at a single glance. The principle that God sees all deeds is one of the essential beliefs of Judaism. Virtually each of the assertions made here about God is based on a biblical verse including The eyes ofYahweh are everywhere (Prov. 15:3); \"If a man enters a hiding place , Do I not see him?\" (Jer. 23:24); For Yahweh searches all minds and discerns the design of every thought (1 Chron. 28:9); and He reveals deep and hidden things , knows what is in the darkness , and light dwells with Him (Dan. 2:22). Another reference to the eyes of God is found in \"Abraham's Dying Vision,\" p. 347.

However, the same passage in Hekhalot Rabbati offers another metaphor for the destruction that will take place: whoever glimpses God's beauty will instantly pour himself out as a vessel. In Moses, Martin Buber speculates that since \"man may not see Me and live,\" and since God is said to have led the people, that \"YHVH goes ahead of the people in order to overthrow foes who meet them on the way.\" This may explain the meaning of Deuteronomy 4:37, where God is said to have led the people out of Egypt \"with His face.\" Even the angels who sing before God are incinerated after singing for only one day.

      "content": "Three keys are in the hand of God that have not been entrusted to anyone — not to an angel, nor to a seraph, nor even to a troop of seraphim. Rather, God keeps them in His own hand. They are the key of the rains, the key of the womb, and the key of the resurrection of the dead. The key of the rains opens the Treasury of Rain in the sixth heaven. The key of birth is the key to the Guf, where the souls of those who have not yet been bom are kept. But no one knows where the key to the resurrection of the dead is hidden, not even the angels. Nor will God take it out until the time has come for the footsteps of the Messiah to be heard. This tradition of three keys is attributed to the talmudic sage. Rabbi Yohanan. These are understood to be the most important keys — to the rain, representing nature; to birth, i.e., life, and to the resurrection of the dead, which is rebirth after death. Each of these is a life-giving force. The extensive traditions about God delegating various heavenly responsibilities to Metatron, in particular, as well as to other angels, are counteracted here with the assertion that God retains the core power of life-giving, and that is the essential power of God; nothing else really matters. This kind of struggle over the primacy of God's role is an integral part of the ongoing dialectic found in Jewish mythology.",

This can also be understood as underneath the arms is the world. The mythic notion that the heavens, and all that is in them, hang beneath God's right arm, and the earth, and all that is in it, hangs beneath His left arm, portrays everything as completely dependent on a God who is larger than the universe. Other myths describe the world hung like an amulet from God's arm. See \"A Universe of Water,\" p. 94. Still others describe God using His arms to destroy prior worlds. See \"Prior Worlds,\" p. 71.

      "content": "The name of God's right hand is Just, and the name of the left is Holy. Sometimes God uses one hand to create something, and sometimes he uses both hands. God used only one hand to create a holy mountain, for it is written. He brought them to His holy realm, the mountain His right hand had acquired (Ps. 78:54). But both Adam and the Temple were created with both of God's hands. How do we know that God created Adam using both hands? Because it is written Your hands have made me and fashioned me (Ps. 119:73). And how do we know that the Temple was created with both hands of God? From the verse The sanctuary, O Yahweh, which Your hands established (Exod. 15:17). That God used His hands to create Adam is strongly suggested by the biblical text: the Lord God formed man from the dust of the earth (Gen. 2:7). This midrash about God's hands suggests an underlying myth that God can create using a single hand or both hands. Biblical verses are brought in to prove that God created using both methods. A holy mountain, probably Sinai, was created with one hand, while biblical verses about Adam and the Temple describe them as having been created out of both hands. These latter two are among God's finest creations, and it is implied that they were even better because they were created with both of God's hands. It is interesting to contrast the myths about God's words with those about God's hands. Because Genesis begins with a creation myth in which God creates through His words, creation through speech became the dominant tradition. But there is also an extensive rabbinic tradition that God made use of His hands. This brief myth from Avot de-Rabbi Natan describes God using his hands to create a mountain, a man, and a Temple. Shloyshe Sheorim explains that God created the world using both of His hands. See Creation from a Mold,\" p. 134, for an alternate account of God creating Adam using his hands. For another example of God's use of His hands, see \"The Work of Creation,\" p. 90, where God forms the world out of balls of fire and ice, that He crushes together. Other examples abound.",

His face and His cheeks are in the image of the spirit, and therefore no man is able to recognize Him. With one eye God sees' from one end of the universe to the other. The sparks that go forth from that eye give light to everyone. With the other eye, God looks behind Himself to see the future. God's splendor fills the universe, luminous and awesome from within the darkness. Platoons of anger are to His right and to His left are splendid bolts of beauty and darkness and cloud, and before him lies a field of stars. His arms are folded. His cheeks are like a bed of spices, as it is said. His cheeks are like a bed of spices (S. of S. 5:13). When God moves, there move behind him cherubs of fire and hailstones to His right, and to His left, the wings of storm and the might of the whirlwind. What is the measure of God's body? His little finger fills the entire universe. His tongue stretches from the one end of the universe to the other. His mouth is fire consuming fire. It is said that whoever knows the measurement of his Creator and the glory of God is secure in this world and in the World to Come. He will live long in this world, and live long and well in the World to Come. Certain mystical texts, especially Shi'ur Komah, describe the body of God in great, sometimes ludicrous, detail. Even God's sexual organ is described and its size detailed. All of these measurements, given in parasangs, are gigantic. As noted here, \"even His little finger fills the entire universe.\" These texts show a strange literalism in which God shares the anatomy of a man. The point is that God's size is so large that it cannot be imagined, although, in describing God's anatomy in great detail, these texts are in fact explicitly imagining it. Were these strange measurements meant to have been taken literally? Like all allegorical material in kabbalistic texts, especially in the Zohar, there is an ambivalence about this. On the one hand, Shi'ur Komah takes the issue of precise measurements very seriously, expanding the myth of God's gigantic body. On the other hand, there is a distinct awareness that these texts are also to be understood in allegorical terms. This represents the antimythological impulses within kabbalah. The central dialectic of kabbalah is focused on the debate between these two perspectives, the mythic",

      "content": "Moses said to the Lord, \"Oh, let me behold Your presence!\" And God answered, \"I will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim before you the name Lord, and the grace that I grant and the compassion that I show. But,\" He said, \"you cannot see My face, for man may not see Me and live.\" And the Lord said, \"See, there is a place near Me. Station yourself on the rock and, as My Presence passes by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock and shield you with My hand until I have passed by. Then I will take My hand away and you will see My back; but My face must not be seen.\" This passage from Exodus establishes the principle that \"you cannot see My face, for man may not see Me and live\" (Exod. 33:20). Nevertheless, there are many exceptions to this rule, most notably a famous midrash in which Moses ascends on high and speaks to God face to face as God is seated upon His throne. See \" The Ascent of Moses,\" p. 261. Especially of note here is the notion of God's back. The suggestion that God has a face and a back goes far in establishing an anthropomorphic image of God. Of course, there is also a strong hint of allegory in this concept — being able to see only God's back suggests that much of God's nature must remain unknowable. This episode about Moses is largely repeated for Elijah in 1 Kings 19:5-12. See \"A Still, Small Voice,\" p. 30.",

      "content": "Moses said to God, \"When I come to the Israelites and say to them 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you/ and they ask me, 'What is His name?' what shall I say to them?\" And God said to Moses, \" Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh .\" He continued, \"Thus shall you say to the Israelites, 'Ehyeh sent me to you.'\" And God said further to Moses, \"Thus shall you speak to the Israelites: Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you: this shall be My name forever, this My appellation for all eternity.\" In this important passage God reveals His name to Moses. Actually, God reveals two names in Exodus 3: \"Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh,\" meaning \"I Am That I Am\" (or \"I Will Be What I Will Be\") and Yahweh (YHVH). This suggests that the priestly editors of Exodus intended to link Yahweh to the God of the patriarchs, although none of them knew God by this name, as directly stated in Exodus 6:2-3: God spoke to Moses and said to him, \"I am the Lord . I appeared to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob as El Shaddai , but I did not make myself known to them by My name YHVH (Exod. 6:2-3). The Samaritan text Memar Markah 1:4 comments about God's name: \"It is a glorious Name that fills the whole of creation. The world is bound together by it. All the covenants of the righteous are bound together.\" God is quoted here as saying: \"I shall not forget this Covenant as long as the world exists. Since you belong to the Most High of the whole world, I have revealed My Great Name to you.\" God is identified by a series of names in the Bible. The two primary names are YHVH (Yahweh), known as the Tetragrammaton, and Elohim (which is plural, literally meaning \"Gods\"). God reveals his true name, YHVH, to Moses in Exodus 6:2, while noting that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob knew Him as \"El Shaddai/' God also identifies himself to Moses, as noted here, as \"I am who I am\" (Exod. 3:14). The biblical text seems to suggest a connection between the Name YHVH and the phrase Ehyeh-AsherEhyeh, \"I am who I am.\" The four-letter Name of God is also known as the Shem haMeforash, \"The Ineffable Name.\" The multiplicity of God's names is itself a mystery. Why is a monotheistic God known by multiple names? Some of these names, such as \"Almighty One,\" or \"the Holy One, blessed be He\" may simply function as attributes of God. But this does not explain the remarkable array of God's names. One possibility is that in the earliest stages of Judaism the names of some of the gods of the surrounding cultures were attributed to the God of Israel as part of the transformation from polytheism to monotheism. This is an example of what might be termed mythic absorption. This may have established the belief that God had many names. In The Old Rabbinic Doctrine of God, A. Marmorstein lists ninety-one rabbinic synonyms for God (pp. 54-107). These include well-known names such as Elohim (\"God\" and \"gods\"), Ruah ha-Kodesh (\"the Holy Spirit\"), Shekhinah (\"Divine Presence\"), Yotzer Olamim (\"Creator of the Worlds\"), ha-Makom (\"the Place\"), Tzur Olamim (\"Rock of the Worlds\"), Shomer Olamim (\"Guardian of the Worlds\") and ha-Shem (\"the Name\"). It is YHVH that remains the preeminent name for God in rabbinic and kabbalistic lore. Moses was the first and last to hear the Name pronounced by God and the Name was said to be inscribed on the staff with which Moses divided the waters of the Red Sea. After that, the tradition holds, the true pronunciation of the Name is only known by one great sage in every generation. The Maharal (Rabbi Judah Loew of Prague, 1525-1609), as well as the Ba'al Shem Tov, were said to know it. Having knowledge of this true pronunciation of the Name was regarded as bestowing secret, magic powers, including mastery of angels, spirits, and demons. Some sources identify the power of the Name as limitless. Note that masculine and feminine elements are perfectly balanced in the Tetragrammaton. The yod has a masculine meaning, the he a feminine one, and the vav a masculine character. Thus the name follows the progression of masculine-femininemasculine-feminine.",

      "content": "All of creation emanates from God's holy Name, YHVH. In the beginning God revealed His holy Name within the empty hollow that was created when God contracted Himself. Then He radiated the first emanation, which became the source of all subsequent creation. YHVH, the four-letter Name of God, is known as the Tetragrammaton. It is one of the two most important biblical names of God, along with Elohim. Rabbinic tradition considers the Tetragrammaton the essential Name of God. The true pronunciation of the Name is believed to have been lost. When the Temple in Jerusalem was still standing, the High Priest would go into the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur and pronounce the Name. This was the only time it was pronounced. After the destruction of the Temple, knowledge of how to pronounce the Name was carefully guarded. One tradition holds that only one great sage in each generation knows the true pronunciation. This righteous man is known as the Tzaddik ha-Dor, the greatest sage of his generation. Among those who were said to have known how to pronounce the Name was the legendary Rabbi Adam, as well as Rabbi Judah Loew (the Maharal) and the Ba'al Shem Tov. In Jewish folklore the Name is sometimes used to bring the dead to life, as in Ma 'aseh Buck no. 171, where a dead man is brought to life by a rabbi in order to confess his crime. See \"The Dead Man's Accusation\" in Lilith's Cave , pp. 109-110. A similar use of the Name is found in Megillat Ahimaaz, where a young man who has died has the Tetragrammaton, written on a piece of parchment, sewn into his arm, making him a kind of living dead. See \"A Young Man Without a Soul\" in Gabriel's Palace , pp. 145-148. More often, the Tetragrammaton is pronounced in order to accomplish a miracle. For example, there is an oral tale collected in the Balkans about Rabbi Shimon ben Duran (1361-1444), who is said to have drawn a picture of a ship on a cell wall, and then brought the ship to life by pronouncing the Name. See \"Rabbi Shimon's Escape\" in Gabriel's Palace , pp. 126-127. See \"The God of the Fathers,\" p. 25.",

      "content": "Once, when Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, the High Priest, went into the Holy of Holies of the Temple to offer incense, he looked up and saw Akatriel Yah, the Lord of Hosts, seated on a high and exalted throne. And the Lord spoke to him and said: \"Ishmael, My son, bless me.\" And Rabbi Ishmael raised his hands in a blessing, and said: \"May it be Your will that Your mercy overcomes Your justice, and may Your children be blessed with Your compassion.\" And when Rabbi Ishmael raised his eyes, the Lord inclined His head toward him. This tale is a talmudic reworking of a biblical incident, exemplifying the pattern of retellings that continues through postbiblical Jewish literature. Here the biblical account of Moses speaking with God inside the Tent of Meeting is reworked into a tale of the High Priest having a vision of God in the Holy of Holies. This extends the link to the divine for another generation. In the biblical version, Moses does not see God, but speaks to him: When Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with him , he would hear the Voice addressing him from above the cover that was on top of the Ark of the Covenant between the two cherubim ; thus He spoke to him (Num. 7:89). At the same time. Rabbi Ishmael's vision is strikingly parallel to that of Isaiah: I beheld Yahweh seated on a high and lofty throne; and the skirts of His robe filled the temple (Isa. 6:1). This indicates how talmudic myths and legends emerge from the cauldron of biblical archetypes. See \"Isaiah's Vision,\" p. 3. This talmudic tale grows out of traditions linked to the Temple in Jerusalem. No one was permitted to enter the Holy of Holies in the Temple except for the High Priest, and then only on Yom Kippur. This talmudic legend recounts how Rabbi Ishmael, the High Priest, had a vision of God inside the Holy of Holies. The name he attributes to God, Akatriel Yah, the Lord of Hosts ( Yahweh Tzevaot) is a very strange one, leaving open the possibility that this might be the name of an angelic figure. However, the traditional readings of this tale have always identified Akatriel Yah as one of the many names of God. Most remarkable is God's request to Rabbi Ishmael — that Ishmael bless God, rather than the reverse. This makes it one of the primary examples of the rabbinic tradition by which God is portrayed as dependent, in some ways, on His creation. See \"The Rabbis Overrule God,\" p. 67. Rabbi Ishmael does bless Akatriel Yah, and in return the Lord of Hosts nods his approval. At the root of this myth is the belief, of primitive origin, that there is a kind of interdependence between man and God. This is best represented by the nature of sacrifices that were made to God. An offering was burned, the smoke of the sacrifice ascended on high, and if the offering was received, fire descended from heaven and consumed the burnt offering (2 Chron. 7:3). Other evidence of this tradition is found in the legend of the angel Sandalphon, who is said to weave the prayers of Israel into crowns of prayers for the Holy One to wear on His Throne of Glory (B. Hagigah 13b). Here, however, the tradition has been modified to the extent that God wears the crowns of prayer not because He needs to in order to be complete, but out of a great love that He holds for the prayers of Israel. There is considerable debate over the identity of Akatriel Yah, who is identified as \"The Lord of Hosts,\" Yahweh Tzevaot. Ancient readers saw this as a name for God Himself. Later commentators identified Akatriel Yah as an angel like Michael or Gabriel. This suggests that there were different, or at least evolving, traditions about Akatriel. It is also said that Akatriel's name is inscribed on God's throne, suggesting that according to one tradition, it was this name rather than that of the Tetragrammaton that was God's primary secret name. In The Mystery of Sandalphon, Akatriel Yah is described as sitting at the entrance of Paradise, with 120 angels surrounding him. Here it is Akatriel rather than Metatron that Elisha ben Abuyah sees seated in Paradise. However, since Akatriel is described as being at the entrance of Paradise, this implies that his position is inferior to that of Metatron, who is found in the highest heavens in B . Hagigah 14b. See \"A Vision of Metatron,\" p. 174. The blessing that Rabbi Ishmael gives to God is identical to what is described as God's prayer earlier in B. Berakhot 7a. See \"God's Prayer,\" p. 35.",

      "content": "Yahweh is a mighty warrior who defeated Pharaoh at the Red Sea. It is said that God smote them with His finger, as it is said. And the magicians said to Pharaoh , \" This is the finger of God\" (Exod. 8:15). Others say that God appeared to Pharaoh as a mighty warrior, carrying a fiery bow, with a sword of lightning, traveling through the heavens in a chariot. When Pharaoh shot arrows at Israel, God shot fiery arrows back. When Pharaoh's army cast rocks, God brought hail. And when Pharaoh shot fiery arrows from a catapult, God deluged them with burning coals. Finally Pharaoh exhausted his entire armory. Then God took a cherub from His Throne of Glory and rode upon it, waging war against Pharaoh and Egypt, as it is said. He mounted a cherub and flew (Ps. 18:11). Leaping from one wing to another, God taunted Pharaoh, \"O evil one, do you have a cherub? Can you do this?\" When the angels saw that God was waging war against the Egyptians on the sea, they came to His aid. Some came carrying swords and others carrying bows or lances. God said to them, \"I do not need your aid, for when I go out to battle, I go alone.\" That is why it is said that Yahweh is a man of war (Exod. 15:3). The intensely mythic description of God riding upon a cherub is found in Psalms 18:11, He rode upon a cherub and did fly. This image was embellished in later rabbinic texts. Confirming the image of God as a great warrior traveling through the heavens in a chariot. Exodus Rabbah 5:14 states that God's bow was fire. His arms flame. His spear a torch, the clouds His shield, and His sword, lightning. The parallels to Zeus and the warrior gods of the Near East are clear. Note that the fiery portrayal of God strongly resembles the sun, and may well be a remnant of sun worship that survives in Judaism. A parallel kind of sun worship can also be seen in the myths surrounding Enoch's transformation into Metatron. One of the angels listed in Sefer ha-Razim is Helios, the Greek sun god. This also indicates a possible remnant of sun worship in Judaism. In addition to Exodus 15:3, Yahweh is a man of war , God is described as a warrior in Psalm 24: Who is the King of glory?— Yahweh, mighty and valiant , Yahweh, valiant in battle (Ps. 24:8). Frank Moore Cross finds in this passage a strong echo of the Canaanite pattern, in which both El and Ba'al are described as a warrior gods. The ideology of holy war is also found in Numbers 10:35: Advance, O Lord! May Your enemies be scattered, and may Your foes flee before you!",

The birds ceased to sing, and all the fowl stopped flying, the beasts of the earth were quiet and the oxen did not low; the wheels of the Chariot of the Lord did not revolve, and the angels were hushed, as was the sea. It was a silence such as had never been before and will never be again.",
      "commentary": "Some say that then God's voice went forth and echoed throughout the world, as it is said. And the people perceived the voices (Exod. 20:15). And all the people who were in the camp trembled, and the earth shook, and the heavens fell down, and the mountains flowed. Israel first heard God's voice coming from the South, so they ran in that direction. Then they heard it coming from the North, so they ran that way. Soon after this they heard it coming from the East, and they turned in that direction. Then they heard it coming from the West, and they turned that way. All at once they heard the voice coming from the heavens, and they looked up. Then they heard it coming from the earth, and they looked down. In this way they learned that no one knows where God is hidden. Others say that not only did God's voice come to them from everywhere, but God revealed Himself to them from all four directions. It is said that each one heard God's voice according to his ability. The old men according to their ability, and the young men according to theirs, and the women according to theirs, and the children and the infants according to theirs, and even Moses according to his, so that each and every one would be able to endure it. As soon as the words issued from the mouth of God they became fire and flew upon the wind, and appeared in the sight of all the people. Then the angels of the Lord descended and took the words of God and brought them to each of the children of Israel and told them of the sanctity of the divine utterance. So too did God's voice split into seven voices, and from these seven into seventy languages, and traveled to the ends of the earth, and entered into the heart of every man. When the voice came forth, each nation heard the voice of God, and its soul departed from it, but Israel was not harmed, as it is said. Has any people heard the voice of God speaking out of afire, as you have , and survived? (Deut. 4:33). The notion that God saved His voice for the giving of the Torah is problematic, in that God created the world by speaking the words, \" Let there be light,\" in Genesis 1:3. So too does God communicate with Abraham by speaking to him on several occasions. The rabbis seem to be making a fine distinction between \"speaking\" and \"a voice.\" In any case, God's voice is an overwhelmingly powerful presence at Mount Sinai. The description of God's voice coming from all directions is based on several biblical verses, especially From the heavens He let you hear His voice to discipline you; on earth He let you see His great fire; and from amidst that fire you heard His words (Deut. 4:36), and God thunders marvelously with His voice (Job 37:5). The idea that God's voice was heard and understood by each according to his ability derives from the verse Moses would speak , and God would answer him in a voice (Exod. 19:19). In this passage, \"a voice\" seems to indicate that each person would hear it in a different way. This becomes emblematic of the teachings of the Torah to be understood differently by different individuals, according to their knowledge and ability. Exodus Rabbah 34:1 comments on this: \"God only comes to them according to their power. When God gave the Torah to Israel, if He had come to them in the fullness of His power they would not have been able to withstand it. But He only came to them according to their power.\" The tradition that the people of Israel heard God speak in many different voices raises the question of whether what they heard were the voices of many gods. Exodus Rabbah 29:1 replies to this concern: \"God said to Israel: 'Do not think because you heard many voices that there are many gods. But know that I alone am the Lord your God.'\" Likewise, God is said to have appeared to the people with many different faces. Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 21:6 considers this issue in a similar way to that of God's voice: \"God appeared to them at Sinai with many faces: a defiant face, a joyous face, a laughing face, a kind and friendly face.... If a heretic says, \"There are two different gods,' answer him: 'It is not written the gods (Elohim) have spoken face after face, but the Lord (YHVH) spoke with you face to face (Deut. 5:4).'\" There is a rabbinic tradition that God's voice is still speaking from Mount Sinai. In Leviticus Rabbah 16:4, Ben Azzai tells Rabbi Akiba that he is hearing the words of the Torah and that they \"are joyful even as they were on the day they were given at Sinai.\" The Ba'al Shem Tov believed that if the people of Israel sanctify and purify themselves, they will always merit hearing the voice of God speaking to them as He did at Sinai (Keter Torah , Yitro). One story about the Ba'al Shem Tov recounts how when he taught schoolchildren, he caused them to experience the Giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai, with the thunder and lightning. Later, at the time of Shavuot, when he spoke to them about the Giving of the Torah, he asked them if they remembered that event. All of them said yes, except for one, who eventually left the path of Judaism ( Kovetz Eliyahu, edited by Hayim Eliyahu Sternberg). In Esh Kadosh, Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira (18891943) asserts, \"Even now the voice of the Torah can be heard emerging everywhere, from within one's own body as well as from the entire outside world.\" Hizkuni claimed to have heard the voice of God pronouncing the Ten Commandments in a dream. In his biblical commentary. Rabbi Yehudah Leib Alter of Ger, known as the Sefat Emet, comments about the verse All the people saw the voices (Ex. 20:15) that each of the people of Israel saw the divine soul within themselves, which was the root of his or her own life-force. Thus they did not require a leap of faith to believe the commandments, because they saw the voices.",

God's image dwelt on him, the very face of God. How terrifying to anyone who beholds it, for no one is able to stand before it. With his hands Moses received the signature of God, and it was a treasure-house of all knowledge. His body mingled with the angels above and he dwelt with them, being worthy of doing so. His speech was like the speech of the Lord. His voice mingled with the voice of the Lord, and he was magnified above all the human race.",
      "commentary": "This is a Samaritan myth about Moses approaching God on Mount Sinai and seeing God's image — the ultimate experience of seeing God face to face. As important as Moses is in Jewish tradition, he is elevated even higher in Samaritan tradition, to a near-divine status. Indeed, it was the rabbinic fear of Moses being regarded as a messianic figure that led the rabbis to minimize his role in the Exodus in the Passover Haggadah. The image of God that Moses sees is a reference to Genesis 1:27: In the image of God He created them. Humans were created in God's image, but here Moses is able to see not only God's reflection, but God's actual image; thus he is able to encounter God face to face.",

Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy elders of Israel ascended, and they saw the God of Israel: under His feet there was the likeness of a pavement of sapphire, like the very sky for purity. Yet He did not raise His hand against the leaders of the Israelites; they beheld God, and they ate and drank. Although God warns Moses at one point that \"Yow cannot see My face, for man may not see me and live\" (Exod. 33:20), in Exodus 24 God invites Moses to bring Aaron, his sons, and 70 of the elders of Israel to Mount Sinai, and there God reveals Himself to them. Further, they are permitted to eat and drink in God's presence. This takes place just before Moses ascends Mount Sinai to receive the Torah, and the purpose of ascending with them is to convince the elders that God truly exists, and that the Torah God is about to reveal is a work of truth.

Here God is said to study both the Written and the Oral Torah. The first five books of the Torah are known as the Written Torah. According to Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 46, God dictated the Torah to Moses during the day and at night He explained it to him. These nightly explanations are known as the Oral Torah, and in time it came to be identified with the Talmud, which was understood to contain within itself the Oral Torah. Nor does God limit his study to the Written and Oral Torah. He also studies the interpretations of the sages, as recounted in B. Hagigah 15b, where it is reported that Rabbah bar Shila once encountered Elijah and asked him, \"What is the Holy One, blessed be He, doing?\" Elijah replied, \"He is saying the teachings of each of the sages.\" For other examples of God's observance of Jewish ritual, see \"God Puts on Tallit and Tefillin,\" p. 34, and \"God Keeps the Sabbath,\" p. 314.",

      "commentary": "This myth not only reaffirms that God prays, but establishes Jerusalem (using the ancient name, Shalem) as the place where God made a tabernacle for Himself. The notion that God would create His own tabernacle and pray to Himself is strange. But who else would God pray to?",

It does not state \"their house of prayer,\" but \"My house of prayer.\" Therefore it can be seen that God says prayers. What is God's prayer? It is, \"May it be My will that My mercy overcome My anger, and that My mercy dominate My attributes.

      "commentary": "This is one in a series of myths about God participating in the same prayer rituals as His people, Israel. See also \"God Studies the Torah,\" p. 34; \"God Puts on Tallit and TefiUin,\" p. 34; and \"God's Tabernacle,\" p. 35. Here God is portrayed as praying. Other myths describe God as singing praises of Israel, just as Israel sings praises of God. Note that the prayer that is described as God's prayer — to Himself presumably — is similar to the blessing that Rabbi Ishmael makes to God when he has a vision of Akatriel Yah — one of God's names — while in the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur, also found in the same talmudic source.

      "commentary": "This myth is also a part of a larger myth cluster in which God's actions mirror those of observant Jews — God not only prays, puts on tallit and tefillin, and studies the Torah, but He even teaches the Torah, demonstrating that He is the Master of masters.

For God is not subject to any limitation, and therefore His suffering is also boundless. It is impossible even to conceive such suffering. If the world ever heard God's weeping, and realized the extent of His grief, it would explode. Even a spark of His suffering would be more than the world could bear. From the day the Temple was destroyed and Jerusalem made desolate, there has been no joy before God. Nor will there be any joy until God rebuilds Jerusalem and returns Israel into its midst. God weeps in the inner chambers of heaven. Three times a day a divine voice, like the cooing of a dove, goes forth, saying, \"Woe to My children. Because of their sins I destroyed My house and burnt My temple and exiled them among the nations.\" And three times a night, during the three watches, God sits and roars like a lion, repeating the same words of grief, as it is said, Yahweh roars from on high , and thunders from His holy dwelling (Jer. 25:30).",

      "content": "When God remembers His children, who dwell in misery among the nations. He lets fall two tears into the ocean, and the sound is heard from one end of the world to the other. So too when God remembers how the Shekhinah lies in the dust of the earth, does He shed tears hot as fire, that fall down into the Great Sea. Others say that in the hour that God cries, five rivers of tears issue from the five fingers of His right hand, and fall into the Great Sea and shake the world. Many human characteristics are attributed to God, even weeping. Here God weeps remembering the suffering of his children, Israel. Just as God's size is enormous (see \"The Body of God,\" p. 24), so too are God's tears. Even more surreal is the image of God weeping rivers of tears from the fingers of His right hand. Implicit in this weeping is both God's helplessness and His need for comfort, which clearly seems to contradict God's omnipotent role as creator and ruler of the world. Zohar 1:26b explains that God's tears roll down to the great sea because Moses brought the Torah down in two tablets, but Israel was not worthy of them and they broke and fell, causing the destruction of the first and second Temples. In the Prologue to the Zohar 56, Rahab, the Angel of the Sea, is said to be sustained by God's tears. The falling of God's tears into the ocean is also given as an explanation for earthquakes.

      "content": "When the Temple was destroyed and Israel banished, God wept bitterly day and night, saying, \"Woe is Me! What have I done? I caused My Shekhinah to dwell on earth for the sake of Israel, but now that they have sinned, I have returned to My former habitation. As below, so above — in both there is weeping over what has come to pass. You weep in the night, but I weep day and night, for My presence knows no sleep.\" Then God hung sackcloth over the entrance of His house, rent his purple garment and went barefoot. So too did God extinguish the lamps, withdrawing the light of the sun and the moon and the stars. And God sat silently and lamented over the Temple. He alone knew of the precious spiritual treasures hidden there. At that time Metatron, the Prince of the Presence, came before the Lord, fell upon his face, and spoke before Him: \"Master of the Universe! Do not weep. Let me weep instead of You.\" God replied, \"If you do not let Me weep now, I will go to a place where you do not have permission to enter, and I will weep there.\"",
      "commentary": "This is a myth of great divine distress, agony, and regret. At the same time, the myth demonstrates God's grief over the chain of events that led to the destruction of the Temple and the exile of the Jews. Although God permitted the destruction of the Temple to take place (and in some myths was the cause of this catastrophe), here he faces the consequences of His actions and weeps. Metatron, who normally substitutes for God in many respects, is so disturbed at the sight of God weeping that he begs to weep for God instead. Metatron's response indicates the rabbinic discomfort at the notion of God weeping. Despite Metatron's offer, God is so distraught that He is ready to go off alone to weep. The place Metatron is not permitted to enter is the Pargod , the heavenly curtain, behind which only God and the Shekhinah can go. This is God's inner sanctum. God's insistence that he will continue to weep is explained by the verse For if you will not give heed, My inmost self must weep, because of your arrogance (Jer. 13:17). In Esh Kadosh Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira proposes that the reason the world was not destroyed by God's suffering over the afflictions of Israel and the destruction of the Temple is because God wept in secret, in his innermost chamber. For had his grief penetrated to this world, it would no longer exist. God's garment is described as purple, referring to the imperial purple garments worn by kings. Indeed, throughout God behaves in mourning as would a human king.",

He said, \"Heavenly Father, You destroyed Your city and burned Your Temple, but now You are tranquil and untroubled.\" Before long Rabbi Tzadok dozed off, and that is when he saw God standing there in the Temple, lamenting, with the ministering angels lamenting with him. On another occasion. Rabbi Nathan entered the Temple area and found the Temple destroyed, with only the Kotel, the Western Wall, still standing. He wondered what the survival of that wall signified, and he heard a voice say, \"Take your ring and press it against the wall.\" Rabbi Nathan did this, and he felt through the ring that the wall was trembling, trembling because of the presence of God. At that instant Rabbi Nathan saw God bow down at the wall and straighten up and weep, and He did this over and over, lamenting.",
      "commentary": "This myth not only confirms God's great grief over the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, but it also conveys just how holy is the Kotel , the western retaining wall of the Temple Mount, which the myth seems to treat as a wall of the Temple itself. Most important is Rabbi Nathan's vision of God praying at the wall. This confirms the immense sanctity associated with the Kotel. Accounts of God praying at the Western Wall are very unusual, while there are many reports of sightings of the Shekhinah, the Divine Presence, who made her home in the Temple before it was destroyed. The Shekhinah is often envisioned as a mourning dove or as an old woman dressed in black, or sometimes as a spirit hovering above the wall.

      "content": "When the Temple was destroyed and Israel exiled from the land, God departed to the higher realms and He did not look upon the destruction of the Temple, or upon His people, who had gone into exile. In that dark time, when the children of Israel wept by the rivers of Babylon, their cries reached the highest heavens, where God and all the angels heard them. Then God yearned to return all of existence to chaos and desolation. God said, \"The world I created, I created with My two hands alone. Now I shall return it to chaos. I will bring heaven and earth together, smiting one against the other, and thus destroy the entire world, all of it; and not merely the earth, but the heavens as well, as it is said, \"I, too , will strike hand against hand and will satisfy My fury upon you \" (Ezek. 21:22). The angels understood that all of existence was on the verge of coming to an end, and that God was about to turn even the Throne of Glory upside down. Then all of the ministering angels came before God and said, \"Master of the Universe, is it not enough for You that You have already destroyed the Temple, Your dwelling place on earth? Will You also destroy Your dwelling place in heaven?\" God replied, \"Do I need comforting? If I kindle but one spark, I can make the world, which I created, perish. I existed before the world was created, and I existed when the world was created, and I will continue to exist, whatever the fate of the world. Verily, I know the beginning and I know the end. Leave My presence.\" This dark myth shows God contemplating ending all existence, not only on earth, but even in heaven. Since God had created the world only for the sake of Israel, Israel's cries of suffering during the Babylonian exile, not long after the destruction of the Temple and the defeat of Jerusalem, bring the purpose of the world's continuing existence into question. This myth portrays a God who seems human in his deep emotional reaction, who comes very close to ending all existence in that bleak moment. That is when the angels, whose existence is also being threatened, intercede, but God's initial reaction to them is one of contempt and anger — \"Do I need comforting?\" God is not flesh and blood, and therefore needs no comforting. \"Verily, I know the beginning and the end\" suggests that God is not going to act on impulse, but that He alone knows His intended plan for existence, from the time of Creation to the End of Days. Even though this response to the angels is abrupt and contemptuous, it also seems to suggest that God has remembered His original plan for the world and has decided not to act on impulse and end all existence. God's reply to the angels, \"I know the beginning and I know the end,\" is elaborated in Eliyahu Rabbah 1:3: \"God knows both the beginning and the end and can tell from the beginning what the end of anything will be like, long, long before it comes to be.\" Rabbi Hayim of Volozhin is clear that all of existence depends on God: \"The entire universe owes its continued existence to the will of God. If God were to rescind His will to maintain the world, it would instantly revert to nothingness\" ( Nefesh ha-Hayim 3:1).",

      "content": "When God took Israel out of Egypt, He took the lantern and went before them, as it is said, Yahweh went before them (Exod. 13:21). God escorted his descendants forty years in the wilderness. He was like a father holding a torch for his son, or like a master holding a torch for his servant. In this way God showed the nations of the world how dear the children were to Him, in that He Himself went before them so that the nations should treat them with respect. In Exodus God Himself leads the children of Israel: Yahweh went before them in a pillar of cloud by day , to guide them along the way , and in a pillar of fire by night , to give them light (Exod. 13:21). In this passage from Exodus Kabbah , however, God guides them by holding a lantern and going before them. Even though the biblical verse from Exodus is quite anthropomorphic, the image of God holding a lantern is far more so, in that God's presence can be hidden in a pillar of cloud or in a pillar of fire, but not when holding a lantern. Indeed, the suggested image is of a giant figure bearing a lantern who is leading the people. Rashi's comment on this verse confirms God's presence: \"God Himself, in His glory, led the cloud before them.\" However, this verse also lends itself to a metaphorical interpretation, where the image of God guiding the people with a lantern can also be understood to mean that God illumined their path. But this allegorical reading cannot diminish the powerful anthropomorphic image of God carrying a lantern and striding before the people through the wilderness.",

The Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain, and the Lord called Moses to the top of the mountain and Moses went up. All the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the blare of the horn and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw it, they fell back and stood at a distance. \"You speak to us,\" they said to Moses, \"and we will obey; but let not God speak to us, lest we die.\" Moses answered the people, \"Be not afraid; for God has come only in order to test you, and in order that the fear of Him may be ever with you, so that you do not go astray.\" So the people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick cloud where God was.",

      "content": "Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it outside the camp, far off from the camp; and he called it the Tent of Meeting. And it came to pass, that every one who sought the Lord went out to the Tent of Meeting, which was without the camp. And it came to pass, when Moses went out to the tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tent. And it came to pass, when Moses entered into the tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the tent; and the Lord spoke with Moses. And when all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the tent, all the people rose up and worshipped, every man at his tent door. And the Lord spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. . . Then it happened that the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud abided within it, and God's glory filled the tabernacle. And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward with their journeys. But if the cloud was not taken up, then they waited until the day came when it was. For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire within it at night, in the sight of all of the House of Israel, throughout all their journeys.",
      "commentary": "Here God descends to fill the Tent of Meeting and Moses is unable to enter it. This image establishes that God's presence takes up space. The key passage is: And Moses was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud abided within it, and God's glory filled the tabernacle. This passage, with its direct statement that God's presence had a physical manifestation, must be counted as one of the most vividly mythic episodes in the Bible. The principle that God's presence takes space was drawn upon in the sixteenth century as the basis of Isaac Luria's kabbalistic theory of tzimtzum, which assumes that prior to Creation, God's presence filled the universe, and there was no room for anything else. So, in order to make space for the world to exist, Luria posited the contraction of God prior to the creation of the world. See \"The Contraction of God,\" p. 13. In Midrash Tanhuma, Shoftim 8 it is said that Moses would enter the Tent of Meeting and stand there, and the voice of God would descend from the heavens as a type of pillar of flame between the cherubim, and Moses heard the voice speaking to him as if it were within himself.",

      "content": "There once was a Jew who went out into the world to seek justice. Somewhere, he was certain, true justice must exist, but he had never found it. So he set out on a quest that lasted for many years. He went from town to town and village to village, and everywhere he went, he searched for justice, but never did he find it. In this way many years passed, until the man had explored all of the known world except for one last, great forest. He entered that dark forest without hesitation, for by now he was fearless, and he went everywhere in it. He went into the caves of thieves, but they mocked him and said, \"Do you expect to find justice here?\" And he went into the huts of witches, where they were stirring their brews, but they laughed at him and said, \"Do you expect to find justice here?\" The man went deeper and deeper into that forest, until at last he arrived at a little clay hut. Through the window he saw many flickering flames, and he was curious about them. So he went to the door and knocked. No answer. He knocked again. Nothing. At last he pushed the door open and stepped inside. Now, as soon as he stepped inside that cottage, the man realized that it was much larger on the inside than it had seemed to be from the outside. It was filled with hundreds of shelves, and on every shelf there were dozens of oil candles. Some of those candles were in precious holders of gold or silver or marble, and some were in cheap holders of clay or tin. And some of the holders were filled with oil and the flames burned brightly, while others had very little oil left. All at once an old man, with a long, white beard, wearing a white robe, appeared before him. \" Shalom aleikhem , my son\" the old man said. \"How can I help you?\" The man replied, \" Aleikhem shalom. I have gone everywhere searching for justice, but never have I seen anything like this. Tell me, what are all these candles?\" The old man said, \"Each of these candles is the candle of a person's soul. As long as the candle continues to burn that person remains alive. But when the candle bums out that person's soul takes leave of this world.\" The man asked, \"Can you show me the candle of my soul?\" \"Follow me,\" the old man said, and he led him through that long labyrinth of a cottage, which the man now saw must be endless. At last they reached a low shelf, and there the old man pointed to a candle in a holder of clay and said, \"That is the candle of your soul.\" Now the man took one look at that flickering candle, and a great fear fell upon him, for the wick of that candle was very short, and there was very little oil left, and it looked as if at any moment the wick would slide into the oil and sputter out. He began to tremble. Could the end could be so near without his knowing it? Then he noticed the candle next to his own, also in a clay holder, but that one was full of oil, and its wick was long and straight and its flame burned brightly. \"And whose candle is that?\" the man asked. \"I can only reveal each man's candle to himself alone,\" the old man said, and he turned and left. The man stood there, quaking. All at once he heard a sputtering sound, and when he looked up, he saw smoke rising from another shelf, and he knew that somewhere, someone was no longer among the living. He looked back at his own candle and saw that there were only a few drops of oil left. Then he looked again at the candle next to his own, so full of oil, and a terrible thought entered his mind. He stepped back and searched for the old man in every corner of the cottage, but he didn't see him anywhere. Then he picked up the candle next to his own and lifted it up above his own. At that instant the old man appeared out of nowhere and gripped his arm with a grip like iron. And the old man said: \"Is this the kind of justice you are seeking?\" The man closed his eyes because it hurt so much. And when he opened his eyes, he saw that the old man was gone, and the cottage and the candles had all disappeared. And he found himself standing alone in the forest and he heard the trees whispering his fate. And he wondered, had his candle burned out? Was he, too, no longer among the living?",
      "commentary": "This story is a folk example of a divine test. The identity of the old man who tends the soul-candles and conducts the test remains a mystery, although his supernatural aspect is quite clear. As the Keeper of the Soul-Candles, he functions as an Elijah-type figure or perhaps as one of the Lamed-vav Tzaddikim, the Thirty-Six Hidden Saints, who are said to be the pillars of the world and are often described as living in the forest. See \"The Thirty-Six Just Men,\" p. 397. It is also possible to view the old man as the Angel of Death, who has come to take the man's soul. Or the old man might even be identified as God, who has descended to this world to administer the test Himself. In any case, the test surely takes place at the behest of God, so it remains a divine one, similar to the divine tests found in Bible, such as those given to Adam and Eve concerning the forbidden fruit (Gen. 3), the Binding of Isaac (Gen. 22), and the trials of Job. Adam and Eve fail the divine test when they eat the forbidden fruit, but Abraham and Job pass the tests given them. Abraham demonstrates his willingness to sacrifice Isaac, and Job retains his faith in God despite a series of tragic events. The man in this story, who is never named, is clearly attempting to fulfill the biblical injunction. Justice, justice, shall you pursue (Deut. 16:20). One way of reading the tale is to see that in arriving at this cottage, the man is on the verge of completing his lifelong quest to find justice, but he is first tested to see if he himself is truly just. It is interesting to note that his quest in this tale is in many ways parallel to that of the man from the country in Kafka s famous parable, \"Before the Law,\" from The Trial, who comes seeking justice at the gates of the Law. See \"Before the Law,\" p. 179. In this folktale the man who seeks justice sins when he attempts to steal oil from the soul-candle next to his own. But there are other Jewish tales in which the reverse is true. See, for example, \"The Enchanted Inn\" in Gabriel's Palace, where a boy finds a candle about to bum out and pours additional oil into it as a good deed, only to discover later that it was the candle of his soul. Another variant, IFA 8335, tells of a cave in which there are bottles of oil, where a person lives until the oil is exhausted. Nor is the motif of soul-candles limited to Jewish folklore. Variants are found in Latin American folklore, as well as in Spanish tales, among others. There is an implicit parallel between the soul-candles, which bum as long as a person lives, and the Jewish custom of lighting yahrzeit candles on the anniversary of a person's death. These memorial candles are intended to last for twenty-four hours, and remain lit until they bum out. The lighting of the yahrzeit candle is done to symbolize the verse. The soul of man is the lamp of God (Prov. 20:27), and this same verse is strongly echoed in this folktale. Note how the two verses from Deuteronomy and Proverbs serve as the foundation of this story. Justice, justice shall you pursue sets in motion the quest that propels the story, and The soul of man is the candle of God is the focus of the climactic episode about the cottage of candles. The quest is one of the most popular types of Jewish (and universal) folktales, especially fairy tales, but here",

      "title": "Mother Zion",
      "content": "Mother Zion cries and laments over the children of Israel when they are in exile, and she waits for them to return to her bosom. When Jeremiah saw the smoke of the Temple in Jerusalem rising up, he broke down. And when he saw the stones that once were the walls of the Temple, he said: \"What road have the exiles taken? I will go and perish with them.\" So Jeremiah accompanied them down the road covered with blood until they reached the river Euphrates. Then he thought to himself: \"If I go on to Babylon, who will comfort those left in Jerusalem?\" Therefore he took his leave of the exiles, and when they saw he was leaving, they wept, as it is said. By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat, sat and wept, as we thought of Zion (Ps. 137:1). As he was returning to Jerusalem, Jeremiah lifted his eyes and saw a woman seated at the top of a mountain, dressed in black, crying in distress, in great need of comfort. So too MYTHS OF THE BRIDE OF tiOD 47 was Jeremiah in tears, wondering who would comfort him. He approached the woman, saying, \"If you are a woman, speak, but if you are a spirit, depart at once!\" She said: \"Do you not recognize me? I am she who has borne seven sons, whose father went into exile in a distant city by the sea. Then a messenger brought the news that my husband, the father of my children, had been slain. And on the heels of that messenger came another with the news that my house had fallen in and slain my seven sons.\" Jeremiah said: \"Do you deserve any more comfort than Mother Zion, who has been made into a pasture for the beasts?\" And she replied: \"I am Mother Zion, the mother of seven, as it is said. She who bore seven is forlorn , utterly disconsolate \" (Jer. 15:9).",
      "commentary": "This myth grows out of the verse She who bore seven is forlorn , utterly disconsolate (Jer. 15:9). It also is linked to Isaiah 66:8: For as soon as Zion travailed , she brought forth her children . The \"she\" is identified with the Land of Israel, giving birth to the figure of Mother Zion, a personification of Zion. Mother Zion cries and laments over the children of Israel when they are in exile, and she waits for them to return to her bosom. There is also an important passage in 2 Kings 19:21-28 concerning \"Fair Maiden Zion,\" another feminine personification of Zion. This is also understood to be the feminine personification of Jerusalem: Fair Maiden Zion despises you , she mocks at you; Fair Jerusalem shakes her head at you. Other passages in Isaiah personify Jerusalem's grief in ways identical to that of Mother Zion: Her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground (Isa. 3:26). At the same time. Mother Zion is an early incarnation of the Shekhinah, who is the mother of Israel, and whose home was the Temple in Jerusalem. Thus the link between Mother Zion and the Shekhinah is a natural one, and Mother Zion may be viewed as one of the personas of the Shekhinah , as distinct as Her identity as the Bride of God. Still, the figure of Mother Zion must be seen as a strong remnant of goddess worship in Judaism, where Mother Zion is the goddess of Zion. The concept of Zion itself attributes a sacred quality to the Land of Israel, transforming it into the Holy Land, and making a personification such as Mother Zion possible. An earlier version of this vision of a mourning woman, much like that in Pesikta Rabbati, is found in IV Ezra 9:38-10:24, dating from around the first century. Thus a strong case can be made that there is a direct chain of tradition from Jeremiah 15:9 to IV Ezra to Pesikta Rabbati, an early medieval midrash. A subsequent version of this story, dating from the sixteenth century, concerns a vision of Rabbi Abraham Berukhim. See \"A Vision at the Wailing Wall,\" p. 63.",

      "content": "God's heavenly treasures were hidden in the innermost of many chambers. They could not be revealed to anyone, for they were too well hidden. So God decided to bring together His heavenly treasures in his daughter, the Shekhinah. That way he would make them available to the world, but only to those who knew where they could be found. So God saw to it that His daughter, the Shekhinah , contained within Herself all the paths of wisdom. Whoever knows those paths has access to God, and to all heavenly wisdom. And whoever would like to fathom those paths must turn to Her for help, for only She knows where God has hidden His heavenly treasures.",
      "commentary": "This myth is presented in the form of a parable in Sefer ha-Bahir, where God is identified as a king, as is standard in rabbinic parables about God. His daughter is the Shekhinah. Despite the allegorical format, the myth being conveyed is quite apparent— it is the myth of the divine pair, but here the male and female are both somehow contained within the same mythic figure. Thus God contains both the male and the female elements, even though they may appear to act independently of each other. Here monotheism reclaims the wholeness of God no matter how many aspects of God are portrayed. From this perspective, dualism itself becomes a form of monotheism. This paradox makes it possible to define a divinity capable of changing His mind, who could have masculine and feminine aspects and still be considered a single divine being. The concept that God has masculine and feminine aspects is explicitly stated in Zohar 3:290a: \"As the Ancient One, whose name be blessed, took on a form. He shaped everything in male and female form. In another form things could not exist. Therefore the first beginning of development was at once male and female, with Hokhmah as father and Binah as mother.\" And the Zohar restates the Bahir's identification of the Shekhinah as mother, daughter, and sister: \"She (Malkhut— the sefirah representing the Shekhinah) is sometimes called daughter and sometimes sister, and here She is called mother. And in fact She is all these\" ( Zohar 2:100b). What are the heavenly treasures in the parable? They are the secrets of Creation and other heavenly mysteries. God is not going to reveal these to everyone, but only to the initiated. These secrets were all used to create God's daughter, representing God's feminine aspect, known as the Shekhinah. Thus all the mysteries of God are focused in this single figure. The parable in Sefer ha-Bahir also states that God hid His treasures not only in the Shekhinah , but in Her garments as well. These garments can be identified as the Oral Torah, or even as the Torah itself. This suggests that the Torah is the means by which God reveals His secrets of Creation.

      "content": "Because of His love for the Shekhinah, God sometimes calls Her \"My sister,\" since they are both from the same place. Sometimes He calls Her \"My daughter,\" since She is truly His daughter. And sometimes He calls Her \"My Mother.\" When Abraham said of Sarah, \"She is my sister\" (Gen. 20:2), he was speaking about the Shekhinah, who was constantly with Sarah. Indeed, when Abraham saw the Shekhinah in the abode of Sarah, he was emboldened to declare, \"She is my sister.\" For in so speaking, Abraham was making a mystical allusion, for the Shekhinah is the daughter of Supernal MYTHS OF THE BRIDE OF &lt;aOD 49 Wisdom, and in calling her his sister, Abraham was following the admonition. Say unto Wisdom , you are my sister (Prov. 7:4). The Shekhinah represents the feminine aspect of God. In this passage from the Sefer ha-Bahir, the point is made that all representations of the feminine are included. For just as humans have daughters, sisters, brides, and mothers, so the divine feminine figure has all of these characteristics as well. Abraham's identification of Sarah as his sister is interpreted in the Zohar as a reference not to Sarah, but to the Shekhinah . The Zohar states that Abraham used the term in a mystic sense, as in the verse my sister , my love , my dove , my undefiled (S. of S. 5:2). The Zohar also identifies the Shekhinah with the figure of Wisdom, linking \" She is my sister \" with the verse. Say unto wisdom , You are my sister (Prov. 7:4).",

      "title": "The Two Shekhinahs",
      "content": "God's daughter, the Shekhinah , exists in two realms at the same time. There is a Shekhinah above, just as there is a Shekhinah below. In Her divine manifestation. She stays in heaven, as it is said. All of the glory of the king's daughter is within Her (Ps. 45:14). There she guards the secrets of the Written Torah. But in her earthly manifestation she comes down to earth from a faraway land, from the side of light, and she reveals the secrets of the Oral Torah. For She is God's messenger, and the world is illuminated through Her deeds, for her deeds give light to the world. So that they can always communicate, God has built a window between them, and whenever She needs Her Father, or He needs Her, they join one another through the window. In this way God Himself enters the world in the form of His daughter. This parable in Sefer ha-Bahir presents the relationship between the feminine elements of the sefirot in mythic terms. The two Shekhinahs, also known as the Two Mothers, refer to the third sefirah, Binah, the symbol of the mother, and the tenth sefirah, Malkhut , which represents the Shekhinah. Thus Binah stands for the upper feminine, the heavenly Shekhinah , and Malkhut stands for the earthly feminine, whose home is in the Temple in Jerusalem. The importance of this myth is to demonstrate that a divine feminine presence can be found above and below. The role of the heavenly Shekhinah derives from the position of the third sefirah , Binah , where the Shekhinah represents God's glory, and she is united with God in the innermost chamber of the king. At the same time, the earthly Shekhinah is linked to the tenth sefirah, Malkhut, where the Shekhinah is in a position to exert her influence on the lives of human beings. Another way of reading this myth is to see it as referring to the two Torahs, the Written Torah and the Oral Torah. Sefer ha-Bahir makes an explicit reference to this tradition in identifying the Shekhinah as a princess, coming from \"a faraway land, from the side of light,\" which would seem to be a reference to heaven. In this kabbalistic myth, the heavenly manifestation of the Shekhinah is linked to the Written Torah, and Her earthly manifestation is linked to the Oral Torah. While the accepted rabbinic tradition is that God revealed both the Written and the Oral Torah at Mount Sinai, Sefer ha-Bahir seems to be suggesting that the Written Torah remains in heaven, while the Oral Torah has been revealed on earth. See \"The Betrothal of the Torah,\" p. 256. Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav's famous first story, \"The Lost Princess,\" from Sippurei Ma asiyot, also concerns a princess, and, as is almost always the case, the king represents God, while the princess represents the Shekhinah, the feminine aspect of God. In \"The Lost Princess,\" Rabbi Nachman describes this princess as having vanished mysteriously, somehow lost to the Other Side. The quest to return the lost princess from Her exile turns out to be an arduous one, which remains unfinished at the end of Rabbi Nachman's story.",

Using magic taught to them by the fallen angel Azazel, that wicked generation brought down the sun, the moon and the stars and stationed them before their idols, to serve them. Then the angels brought a complaint before God, and God immediately removed the Shekhinah from their midst. And as the Shekhinah ascended on high, the angels surrounded Her with psalms and songs and by the sound of the shofar and trumpets, as it is said, God went up with a fanfare of trumpets (Ps. 47:6). Indeed, some say that in this way the angels themselves succeeded in raising up the Shekhinah on high. The glory of the Shekhinah rose from the heavenly firmament to the chambers of the palace, from the chambers of the palace to the palace of majesty, from the palace of majesty to the fiery citadel, from the fiery citadel to the flaming castle, from the flaming castle to the ranks of the angels, from the ranks of the angels to the wheels of the chariot, from the wheels of the chariot to the Throne of Glory. Then the heavens rejoiced, clothed in joyful garments and wrapped in glory. The sun and the moon and all the stars danced before the Throne of Glory and before God. But while the heavens celebrated, the Prince of the World and all the orders of creation put on mourning and clothed themselves with grief and sighing, as it is said. Therefore the land will mourn (Hos. 4:3).",

      "content": "The plan of Creation was to mirror the upper and lower worlds. Therefore, at the beginning of Creation, the Shekhinah dwelt in the lower world. At first, the worlds above and below drew on each other, and the links between them were perfect, drawing from above to below, and from below to above. But because the Shekhinah dwelt below, the heavens and the earth became fragmented. Then Adam sinned, ruining the channels linking the worlds, and Creation became unraveled. The Shekhinah completely fled from this world. It was Abraham who drew the Shekhinah back from the world above. His body served as a seat for the Shekhinah, who would sit on his back, as it is said, God arose above Abraham (Gen. 17:22). So did Isaac and Jacob serve as the throne of God's Chariot. Still, the Shekhinah was without a home. During the day She would fly through the air, carried on the backs of the Forefathers, but She never found the peace She knew at the beginning of Creation. Then Moses and the children of Israel came and built the Tabernacle and its sacred vessels. They repaired the broken channels, until living water flowed again. Then the Shekhinah returned to dwell in the lower spheres. But now She dwelt in the Tent of Meethig, and not on the ground, as at the beginning of Creation. That is the meaning of the verse And let them make Me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them (Exod. 25:8). So it was that wherever Israel wandered, the Shekhinah dwelt among them, roaming from place to place. This distressed David, and he yearned to find a permanent place for the Shekhinah to dwell. God sent a message to David through Nathan the Prophet: Thus says the Lord: Are you the one to build a house for Me to dwell in? From the day I brought my people out of the land of Egypt to this day I have not dwelt in a house, but have moved about in tent and Tabernacle\" (2 Sam. 7:5-6). So David designed the form of the Temple to create a throne and dwelling place for the Shekhinah. Solomon came after that and built the Temple, and the Shekhinah descended to Her eternal home and once more dwelt in the land. Once again the channels between heaven and earth were open, and in this way the Shekhinah drew abundant blessings down on Jerusalem and on all of the Holy Land. She will never move from this holy place, as it is said. This is My resting-place for all time (Ps. 132:14). This kabbalistic version of the earthly descent of the Shekhinah comes from Sha’arei Orah, a thirteenth century kabbalistic text by Yosef Gikatilla. Here can be found the fully developed kabbalistic reworking of the myth of the Shekhinah. At the same time, there are some unique aspects of Gikatilla's version of the myth that almost seem to anticipate Lurianic kabbalah in the sixteenth century. The primary quest of the myth is to find a home for the Shekhinah. At the beginning of Creation, the Shekhinah makes Her home on earth, to balance God's dwelling on high. The balance between above and below makes contact between them possible.",

      "content": "The Shekhinah has many garments, consisting of holy angels from above and Israel from below. From these garments God created the Throne of Glory, as well as heaven and earth and all the creatures therein. The robe of the Shekhinah is made of light. The light of the first day is reflected from that robe. The Shekhinah wears that robe whenever Israel gives forth light through good deeds. But when Israel does evil. She is garbed in the black garments of Lilith, and She is forced to wear them until Israel repents. The Shekhinah is often described as a bride wearing a garment of light. This myth describes the Shekhinah as wearing garments of light whenever God is pleased with the good deeds of Israel, and black garments when Israel sins. Tikkunei ha-Zohar explains that the Shekhinah puts on these harsh garments to protect Israel. Alternately, the harsh garments are identified as black garments belonging to Lilith, thereby putting the Shekhinah , the positive feminine aspect of God, under the power of the evil Lilith, who represents the dark feminine. Indeed, in the Zohar and other kabbalistic texts, Lilith and the Shekhinah are portrayed as feminine polar opposites. The robe of the Shekhinah is linked to the light of the first day of Creation.

      "title": "The Sacred Bedchamber",
      "content": "On the very day King Solomon completed the building of the Temple in Jerusalem, God and His Bride were united, and Her face shone with perfect joy. Then there was joy for all, above and below. As long as the Temple stood, it served as the sacred bedchamber of God the King and His Bride, the Shekhinah. Every midnight She would enter through the place of the Holy of Holies, and She and God would celebrate their joyous union. The loving embrace of the King and His Queen assured the well-being not only of Israel, but also of the whole world. The King would come to the Queen and lie in Her arms, and all that She asked of Him he would fulfill. He placed his left arm under Her head. His right arm embraced Her, and He let Her enjoy His strength. Their pleasure in each other was indescribable. He made His home with Her and took His delight between Her breasts. They lay in a tight embrace, Her image impressed on His body like a seal imprinted upon a page, as it is written, Set me as a seal upon Your heart (S. of S. 8:6). As long as the Temple stood, the King would come down from his heavenly abode every midnight, seek out his Bride, and enjoy her in their sacred bedchamber. But when the Temple was destroyed, the Shekhinah went into exile, and Bride and Groom were tom apart. This explicit myth portrays the interaction of God and His Bride as a highly eroticized coupling, a sacred copulation ( zivvug ha-kodesh ). This is a primal image of the sacred marriage (hieros gamos). In Zohar 1:120b, this is referred to as \"the one total coupling, the full coupling, as is proper.\" Zohar 3:296a expands on this: \"The Matronita (the Shekhinah) united herself with the king. From this, one body resulted.\" This illustrates the strong sexual dimension of kabbalistic thought, especially in the Zohar. It also demonstrates the direct correlation between the unity and union of God and His Bride and the existence of the Temple in Jerusalem. The destruction of the Temple",

      "content": "Before God destroyed His house and the holy land below. He first cast His Bride from on high, bringing Her down from where she took nourishment from the sacred heavens. Only then did He destroy the Temple in the world below. For these are the ways of God when He wishes to judge the world: First He passes judgment on the world above, and then He establishes His justice in the world below.",
      "commentary": "This myth is a variant of the myth of the exile of the Shekhinah, creating a link between the destruction of the Temple and the departure of the Shekhinah from Her heavenly home. It is shocking in its violence — God casts His Bride out of heaven, an exile parallel to that of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. One purpose of the myth is to demonstrate that God also suffered great losses at the time the Temple was destroyed. Here, furthermore, it is asserted that God's losses preceded those of the Temple. For only after God had cast out His Bride from on high did He permit the destruction of the Temple. See \"The Exile of the Shekhinah ,\" p. 57. Like the Shekhinah, Lucifer was cast out of heaven. But while Lucifer led a rebellion against God, there is no evidence that the Shekhinah did anything wrong. Instead, her removal from heaven symbolizes the high price paid above as well as below.",

She wandered from the cover of the Ark to one of the cherubs, from the first cherub to the second, from the second cherub to the threshold of the Temple, from the threshold to the court of the priests, from the court to the altar, from the altar to the roof of the Temple, from the roof to the wall, from the wall to the city of Jerusalem, from the city to the Mount of Olives, from the mount to the desert. During this time the Shekhinah hid Herself in exile like the moon behind a cloud and could not be seen. Even though Israel yearned to look at the light, it was impossible to see Her, because She was in darkness. That was a darkness so deep it is known as \"the darkened light.\"",
      "commentary": "Some say that the Shekhinah lingered in the wilderness for six months, waiting for Israel to repent. But when they did not. She proclaimed, \"Let them perish!\" Others say that the Shekhinah dwelt for three and a half years on the Mount of Olives, crying out three times a day, \" Turn back , O rebellious children !\" (Jer. 3:22). When this proved to be futile, she said, \"I will return to my abode\" (Hos. 5:15), and She departed the city through the Gate of Mercy and ascended to heaven to await their repentance. And it is said that when She comes back. She will return through that same gate. This myth recounts ten stages of the wandering of the Shekhinah from the Temple to the desert. At each station she becomes more remote from the people of Israel, driven away by their sins. The Gate of Mercy through which the Shekhinah departs Jerusalem was said to have been built by King Solomon with stones brought him by the Queen of Sheba. It is said that after the time of the destruction of the Temple, this gate sank into the earth. But its restoration is expected at the time of the coming of the Messiah, for the children of Israel will return through that gate. This myth is parallel to that of the Removal of the Shekhinah , in which each major sin of Israel resulted in the Shekhinah moving further away from this world. See the commentary to \"The Earthly Dwelling of the Shekhinah\" for a discussion of it.",

      "title": "The Exile Of The Shekhinah",
      "content": "When the Temple was still standing, Israel would perform their rites, and bring offerings and sacrifices. And the Shekhinah rested upon them in the Temple, like a mother hovering over her children, and all faces were resplendent with light, so that there was blessing both above and below. When the Temple was destroyed, the Shekhinah came and went up to all those places where She used to dwell, and She would weep for Her home and for Israel, who had gone into exile, and for all the righteous and the pious ones who had perished. At that time the Holy One, blessed be He, questioned the Shekhinah , and said to her, \"What ails you?\" And She replied, weeping, \"My children are in exile, and the Sanctuary has been burnt, so why should I remain here?\" Now the Temple is destroyed and the Shekhinah is with Israel in exile and there is no joy to be found, above or below. The myth about the separation of God and His Bride is a primary example of the emergence of the Shekhinah as an independent mythical figure. The story also resembles the conflict between an angry couple, where the wife leaves the husband and accompanies the children, here the children of Israel. From the perspective of the Zohar, the fact that the Shekhinah accompanied Israel is evidence of God's attachment to Israel: \"All the time Israel was in exile, the Shekhinah was in exile with them. And since the Shekhinah was with them, God remembered them, to do good to them and bring them out of exile\" ( Zohar 1:120b). The exile of the Shekhinah is presented in the form of a parable about a king in Sefer ha-Bahir, in which the king had a beautiful wife and children, but when the children turned to evil ways, the king became angry with the children and their mother. The mother then went to the children and upbraided them for their behavior and its consequences until they changed their ways and did the will of their father. Then the king remembered them and loved them as much as he did in the beginning, and also remembered their mother. The king, of course, is God, and the king's wife the Shekhinah ,",
      "commentary": "while the children are the children of Israel. According to Rabbi Shlomo Rabinowitz of Radomsk, \"The Shekhinah protects Jews like a mother taking care of her children\" (Tiferet Shlomo on Deuteronomy 29:27). The myth of the exile of the Shekhinah found in the Zohar follows this earlier parable closely, and the earlier parable may well be the inspiration for it. It is interesting to note that in the parable from Sefer ha-Bahir , the queen is responsible for the well-being of her children, and the fate of the queen depends on the fate of her children. When the children repent and God loves them once again. He also remembers His love for their mother, the queen. According to the Zohar, the exile of the Shekhinah that took place at the time of the destruction of the Temple was not Her first exile, but Her second. The first took place when Adam sinned, and the Shekhinah went into disgrace and was dismissed from the celestial palace, going into exile. Thus a distinct parallel is drawn between the consequences of the sin of the forbidden fruit and the destruction of the Temple. Both are regarded as cosmic catastrophes. The weeping of the Shekhinah in this myth has parallels with the weeping of Rachel in Jeremiah 31:15, and with the weeping of Mother Zion in Jeremiah 15:9, 4 Ezra 9:3810:24 (where there is a Mother Zion-type of figure) and in Pesikta Rabbati 26:7. Indeed, it is likely that Mother Zion was a precursor figure to the medieval kabbalistic evolution of the concept of the Shekhinah into the Bride of God. See \"Mother Zion,\" p. 46. The weeping of the Shekhinah is also central to the sixteenth century tale, \"A Vision at the Wailing Wall.\" See this story, p. 63. The kind of conflict between God and the Shekhinah reflected in this myth resembles the marital disputes between Zeus and Hera in Greek mythology. See the Introduction, p. lxv, for a discussion of the parallels between Zeus and Hera and God and the Shekhinah. See Graves, The Greek Myths, 13c, 13.1.",

      "title": "Mourning Over The Shekhinah",
      "content": "After the Temple had been destroyed and the Shekhinah had gone into exile, all the angels went into mourning for Her, and they composed dirges and lamentations for her. So too did all the upper and lower realms weep for Her and go into mourning. Then God came down from heaven and looked upon His house that had been burned. He looked for His people, who had gone into exile. And He inquired about His Bride, who had left Him. And just as she had suffered a change, so too did Her husband — His light no longer shone, and He was changed from what He had been. Indeed, by some accounts God was bound in chains. God said to the ministering angels, \"When a mortal king mourns, what does he do?\" They said, \"He extinguishes his torches.\" God said \"I too shall do that. The sun and moon will become black, and the stars stop shining\" (Joel 4:15). God said, \"When a mortal king mourns, what does he do?\" They said, \"He sits in silence.\" God said, \"I too shall do that. I will sit alone and keep silent.\" God said, \"When a mortal king mourns, what does he do?\" They said, \"He sits and laments.\" God said, \"I too shall do that.\"",
      "commentary": "Here God and the angels are shown in mourning over the exile of the Shekhinah. Even the heavens and the earth are said to mourn, as in the verse, \"7 clothe the skies in blackness and make their raiment sackcloth\" (Isa. 50:3). So too is the mourning of the angels confirmed with a prooftext: The angels of peace wept bitterly (Isa. 33:7). The most daring part of the myth is the suggestion that, having lost the Shekhinah, God's glory has somehow been reduced — \"His light no longer shone, and He was changed from what He was before.\" What has been lost is the feminine aspect of God, and without it God is incomplete. This myth seems to contradict the general view that God is unchanging and eternal, and makes God dependent on His Bride in the same way that a husband is dependent on his wife. Indeed, God is here referred to as a \"husband.\" In Zohar 1:182a God's diminishment is explained as follows: \"The secret of the matter is that blessings reside only where male and female are together.\" The explanation in Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 13:9 that God was bound in chains, derives from God's promise that \"7 will be with him in distress\" (Ps. 91:15), so that when Jeremiah was bound in chains, so too was God.",

      "title": "Lilith Becomes God's Bride",
      "content": "After God dismissed His Bride, the Shekhinah , from His presence, at the time of the destruction of the Temple, God brought in a maidservant to take Her place. Who is this maidservant? She is none other than Lilith, who once made her home behind the mill, and now the servant is heir to her mistress, as it is said, A slave girl who supplants her mistress (Prov. 30:23). She rules over the Holy Land as the Shekhinah once ruled over it. Thus the slave-woman has become the ruler of the House, and the true Bride has been imprisoned in the house of the slave-woman, the evil Lilith. There the Bride is held in exile with her offspring, whose hands are tied behind their backs, wearing many chains and shackles. That is a bitter time for the exiled Bride, who sobs because Her husband, God, does not throw His light upon Her. Her joy has fled because She sees Her rival, Lilith, in Her house, deriding Her. And when God sees his true Bride lying in the dust and suffering. He, too, will become embittered and descend to save Her from the strangers who are violating Her. So it is that in the days to come news will come to God's consort, Lilith, that the time has come for her to go. Then she who plays the harlot will flee from the sanctuary, for if she were to come there when the woman of worth was present, she would perish. Then God will restore the Shekhinah to Her place as in the beginning, and God and His true Bride will again couple with each other in joy. As for the evil slave-woman, God will no longer dwell with her, and she will cease to exist. This startling myth describes the ascent of the demoness Lilith, in which she becomes God's consort after His separation from his Bride. It is based on an interpretation of the verse A slave girl who supplants her mistress (Prov. 30:23). The identification of Lilith as once living behind a mill is based on the verse about the slave girl who is behind the millstones (Exod. 11:5). In folk tradition, Lilith was especially likely to be found in places such as a ruin or behind a mill. Here a strong contrast is made between her low beginnings and her ascent to become God's consort.",
      "commentary": "This myth represents the apex of Lilith's ambitions, but it is also understood that her position is only temporary— until God's true Bride, the Shekhinah, returns at the time of the coming of the Messiah. The ruling presence of the demonic Lilith over the Holy Land, as she takes the place of her predecessor, is offered to explain the long exile of the Jews that followed the destruction of the Temple and subsequent exile. Note that in this version of the separation of God and the Shekhinah , God is described as having dismissed Her rather than an alternate version, also found in the Zohar (l:202b-203a), in which the Shekhinah and God have a confrontation about the fate of the Temple and the children of Israel sent into exile, and she decides to leave on Her own. See \"The Exile of the Shekhinah ,\" p. 57. It is impossible to read this myth without seeing a parallel to the story of Abraham and Hagar. Hagar was Sarah's maidservant, but when Sarah remained barren, Abraham conceived Ishmael, his first child, with Hagar, And when she saw that she had conceived , her mistress was lowered in her esteem (Gen. 16:4). The enmity between Sarah and her maidservant is thus parallel to that of God's Bride and the maidservant Lilith. The Zohar (3:97a) adds a fascinating explanation for the link between Lilith and the Shekhinah : \"This recondite mystery is that of two sisters.\" In kabbalistic mythology, the Shekhinah represents the feminine aspect of the side of holiness, while Lilith represents the feminine aspect of the side of evil. Thus they are tied together, like two sisters. The myth ends by predicting the reunion of God and the Shekhinah and the end of Lilith's existence. It is unstated but understood that this will take place at the time of the coming of the Messiah.",

      "content": "Whenever Israel went into exile, the Shekhinah was with them. When they were exiled to Babylon, the Shekhinah was with them; when they were exiled to Elam, the Shekhinah was with them; and when they were exiled in Edom, the Shekhinah was with them. When Israel were journeying in the wilderness, the Shekhinah went in front of them, and they on their side followed Her guidance. The Shekhinah was accompanied by clouds of glory, and when She journeyed, the Israelites took up their march. When the Shekhinah ascended, the cloud also ascended on high, so that all men looked up and asked: Who is She that comes up from the desert like columns of smoke? (S. of S. 3:6). For the cloud of the Shekhinah looked like smoke because the fire that Abraham and his son Isaac kindled clung to it and never left it, and by reason of that fire it ascended both as cloud and smoke; but for all that it was perfumed, with the cloud of Abraham on the right and with the cloud of Isaac on the left. And when Israel returns from exile, the Shekhinah will return with them, as it is said, With me from Lebanon, O bride, with me you shall come from Lebanon (S. of S. 4:8). The presence of the Shekhinah is indicated here by a series of prooftexts. Thus the presence of the Shekhinah in Babylon is linked to the verse On your account I zvas sent to Babylon (Isa. 43:14). The verse And I will set My throne in Elam (Jer. 49:38) is linked to the presence of the Shekhinah there. Likewise, the presence of the Shekhinah in Edom is linked to the verse Who is this who coming from Edom? (Isa. 63:1).",

      "content": "When the Temple had been destroyed, and Israel was being banished from Jerusalem, God said, \"Whom among the Fathers would you have lead you? Whether it be Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob, whether Moses or Aaron, I shall raise up any one of them from his grave, and he will lead you. Or if you would prefer David or Solomon, I shall raise either of them and he will lead you.\" The congregation of Israel replied, \"Master of the Universe, we do not wish to choose any one of these. You are our only Father.\" God replied, \"Since that is your wish, I will be your companion, for I Myself will accompany you to Babylon.\" Two verses serve as the primary prooftexts of this myth. As to why Israel turned down the patriarchs, the verse cited is For Abraham knows us not ... You , O Lord , are our Father , our Redeemer (Isa. 63:16). Isaiah 43:14 provides evidence that God accompanied the people to Babylon: On your account I was sent to Babylon (Isa. 43:14).",
      "commentary": "This myth is unusual in that Israel's rejection of the patriarchs is very uncharacteristic. Reading this midrash through a kabbalistic lens, we might find it unusual that it speaks of God, who in kabbalah is masculine, as accompanying the people, rather than the Shekhinah, who is usually mentioned in midrashim of this sort, and who the kabbalists saw as feminine.",

      "title": "The Face Of The Shekhinah",
      "content": "In the days of Moses even the ordinary Israelite had the privilege of being spoken to by the Shekhinah face to face. In later times, not even Ezekiel was accorded this privilege. It is said that whoever leaves a synagogue and enters the House of Study to engage in the study of the Torah will have the merit of seeing the face of the Shekhinah. So too when scholars discuss the Torah, they often behold the face of the Shekhinah and are surrounded with fire. Such was the case when Rabbi Hiyya came to visit Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai. As he passed the window, he saw a fiery curtain inside the house, with the Shekhinah on one side of the curtain and Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai on the other. They were studying Torah that way, and Rabbi Shimon's countenance was aflame with the intoxication of the Torah. Rabbi Hiyya was so electrified by this sight that he could not even knock on the door. All at once the door opened, and Rabbi Hiyya looked inside. As he did, he glimpsed the face of the Shekhinah . And he lowered his eyes and stood frozen in place. When Shimon bar Yohai saw that Rabbi Hiyya had been struck dumb, he said to his son. Rabbi Eleazar: \"Go to Rabbi Hiyya and pass your hand over his mouth.\" Eleazar did this, and at last Rabbi Hiyya recovered his senses.",
      "commentary": "Some say that to see the righteous and saintly sages of one's generation is to see the very face of the Shekhinah. Why are these called the face of the Shekhinah ? Because the Shekhinah is hidden in them, and they reveal Her. This much is certain: Before they died and gained entrance to the celestial palace, all the saints who had descended from Adam came face to face with the Shekhinah . Of them it is said, \"A cord of the Divine wilf has been grasped here on earth.\" The meaning of the phrase \"the face of the Shekhinah\" can also be understood as the presence or immanence of the Divine. In the Kabbalistic era, the figure of the Shekhinah shifted from being identified as God's presence in this world to the role of God's Bride. However, some scholars, such as Ephraim Urbach in The Sages and Max Kiddushin in The Rabbinic Mind, have argued that the term Shekhinah should be regarded as one more name of God, like Adonai (the Lord), ha-Shem (the Name), or ha-Makom (the Place), etc. Of course, the Name of Names is YHVH, the Tetragrammaton. Beginning with the Bible, a living person was forbidden to see God face to face, as stated in the verse. No man shall see my face and live (Exod. 33:20) Moses is the sole exception. Yet, somehow, it is far more common to see the face of the Shekhinah. This suggests that the term Shekhinah was not a simple synonym for God, but a term with special meanings, referring to the perception of the presence of God. The use of the term face does bring with it suggestions of personification, an important fact in light of the later evolution of the term \"Shekhinah\" to refer to the Bride of God. For these descriptions of those who somehow experience the face of the Shekhinah have the quality of personal encounters. We note that the Divine appearance was far more common in the earliest biblical times than later, since even Ezekiel was denied the right of seeing the face of God. Yet it could also be argued that his detailed account of his vision in the first chapter of the Book of Ezekiel, known as a vision of the Merkavah, God's Divine Chariot, is actually another kind of vision of the face of the Shekhinah, since both involve visions of God. But the best explanation is that the term Shekhinah had one meaning in the rabbinic era and another in the kabbalistic and Hasidic ones. Yet even in the rabbinic period the precise meaning of Shekhinah\" is far from certain, and varies considerably among its many sources. See The Immanence of God by J. Abelson for a thorough overview of these sources. The tale of Rabbi Hiyya's striking glimpse of the face of the Shekhinah is found in the Zohar, one of a cycle of tales about Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai and his disciples. In all of these tales. Bar Yohai is portrayed as a consummate mystical master, guiding his disciples to experience the divine mysteries. Mystical union is the most essential aspect of any mystical tradition. Yet it is rarely portrayed as openly as it is here, where Rabbi Hiyya sees the face of the Shekhinah inside Shimon bar Yohai's house. He perceives that Shimon bar Yohai is studying the Torah with a divine being, with a curtain of fire separating them. Note that what Rabbi Hiyya sees is not presented as a vision, but it affects him as a visionary experience. Indeed, he is so caught up in the moment of mystical union that Rabbi Shimon sends his son Eleazar to cover Rabbi Hiyya's mouth, which brings him back to this world. One of the fascinating mysteries of this tale is why Bar Yohai chooses to have Rabbi Hiyya's mouth covered, and not his eyes, which had witnessed the vision. One possible answer is that he does not want to cut off the vision, but rather to prevent Rabbi Hiyya's soul from leaving his body during the instant of mystical union. Another possibility is that since Rabbi Hiyya has been struck dumb, the gesture of the hand restores his speech. The curtain of fire that separates Bar Yohai from the Shekhinah suggests both the Pargod, the heavenly curtain that separates God from the rest of Paradise, and the curtain in the Holy of Holies in the Temple beyond which only the High Priest was permitted to go. The fact that a curtain remains separating Rabbi Hiyya and the heavenly being suggests that even in the grip of powerful mystical experiences, there was not a complete loss of self-identity for Jewish mystics, as is so often associated with mystical union in other religions. There is also the suggestion that just as God remains apart from the angels, so humans must remain separated from divine beings.",

      "content": "The Shekhinah dwells inside of each and every Jew, as it is said, I shall dwell in them (Exod. 25:8). Therefore everyone of Israel must raise up the Shekhinah from Her exile, must raise Her up from the dust, and liberate Her from the Sitra Ahra, the Other Side, among whom She has been caught. Here the concept of the Shekhinah is identified as an interior presence, much like the extra soul (neshamah yeterah) that every Jew is said to receive on the Sabbath. Indeed, the arrival of the Sabbath Queen, which is one of the names of the Shekhinah , and the arrival of the extra soul on the Sabbath is simultaneous. So too is their departure simultaneous at the end of Havdalah, the Sabbath closing ceremony. See \"The Second Soul,\" p. 310. The internal nature of the Shekhinah seems to be particularly associated with Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav and his scribe. Rabbi Nathan of Nemirov. Rabbi Nachman's story \"The Lost Princess\" is an allegory about the search for the exiled Shekhinah , about which Rabbi Nathan commented: \"Everyone of Israel must raise up the Shekhinah from her exile,\" making it a personal as well as a collective task. The notion of the internal Shekhinah seems to parallel Carl Jung's later concept of the anima, the feminine aspect of a man, who likewise dwells within.",

      "content": "In those days Rabbi Abraham Berukhim was known for performing the Midnight Vigil. He rose every night at midnight and walked through the streets of Safed, crying out, \"Arise, for the Shekhinah is in exile, and our holy house is devoured by fire, and Israel faces great danger.\" He longed, more than anything else, to bring the Shekhinah out of exile. Now Rabbi Abraham was a follower of Rabbi Isaac Luria, known as the Ari. The Ari had great mystical powers. By looking at a man's forehead he could read the history of his soul. He could overhear the angels and he knew the language of the birds. He could point out a stone in a wall and reveal whose soul was trapped in it. So too was he able to divine the future, and he always knew from the first day of Rosh ha-Shanah who among his disciples was destined to live or die. This knowledge he rarely disclosed, but once, when he learned there was a way to avert the decree, he made an exception. Summoning Rabbi Abraham Berukhim, he said: “Know, Rabbi Abraham, that a heavenly voice has gone forth to announce that this will be your last year among us — unless you do what is necessary to change the decree.\" \"What must I do?\" asked Rabbi Abraham. \"Know, then,\" said the Ari, \"that your only hope is to go to the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem and pray there with all your heart before God. And if you are deemed worthy you will have a vision of the Shekhinah. That will mean that the decree has been averted and your name will be inscribed in the Book of Life after all.\" Rabbi Abraham thanked the Ari with all his heart and left to prepare for the journey. First he shut himself in his house for three days and nights, wearing sackcloth and ashes, and fasted the whole time. Then, although he could have gone by donkey or by wagon, he chose to walk to Jerusalem. And with every step he took, he prayed to God to reveal such a vision of the Shekhinah to him. By the time Rabbi Abraham reached Jerusalem, he felt as if he were floating, as if his soul had ascended from his body. And when he reached the Wailing Wall, Rabbi Abraham had a vision there. Out of the wall came an old woman, dressed in black, deep in mourning. And when he looked into her eyes, he became possessed of a grief as deep as the ocean, far greater than he had ever known. It was the grief of a mother who has lost a child; the grief of Hannah, after losing her seven sons; the grief of the Shekhinah over the suffering of Her children, the children of Israel, scattered to every comer of the earth. At that moment Rabbi Abraham fell to the ground in a faint, and he had another vision. In this vision, he saw the Shekhinah once more, but this time he saw Her dressed in Her robe woven out of light, more magnificent than the setting sun, and Her joyful countenance was revealed. Waves of light arose from her face, an aura that seemed to reach out and surround him, as if he were cradled in the arms of the Sabbath Queen. \"Do not grieve so. My son Abraham, She said. Know that My exile will come to an end, and My inheritance will not go to waste. Your children shall return to their country and there is hope for your future\" (Jer. 31:17). Just then Rabbi Abraham's soul returned to him from its journey on high. He awoke refreshed, as if he had shed years of grief, and he was fille d with hope. When Rabbi Abraham returned to Safed he was a new man, and when the Ari saw him, he said at once: \"I can see from the aura shining from your face that you have been found worthy to see the Shekhinah, and you can rest assured that you will live for another twenty-two years.\" And he did. This mythic story, \"A Vision at the Wailing Wall,\" derives from the city of Safed in the sixteenth century. This story comes from the last of three letters written from Safed by Shlomel Dresnitz of Moravia in 1607 to his friend in Cracow. It is one of a cycle of tales about the great Jewish mystic Rabbi Isaac Luria. These stories about the Ari were collected in several volumes, including Shivhei ha-Ari, Sefer Toledot ha-Ari, and Iggerot Eretz Yisrael. This famous tale has a number of biblical and rabbinic precedents. The final words that the Shekhinah speaks to Rabbi Abraham come directly from Jeremiah 31:17. They are the words God speaks to console Rachel, weeping for her children (Jer. 31:14-16). There is also a strong echo of Jeremiah's vision of Mother Zion in Jeremiah 15:9, which is developed in Pesikta Rabbati 26:7. Mother Zion is likely an early incarnation of the Shekhinah. See \"Mother Zion,\" p. 46. The assumption that the Shekhinah could still be found at the Western Wall, despite the destruction of the Temple, is found in rabbinic sources such as Midrash Tehillim on Psalms 11:3 and Exodus Rabbah 2:2, and in Rabbi Moshe Alshekh on Lamentations 1:1-2.",

      "content": "God created the world in six days, but what has He been doing ever since? He sits and makes matches, assigning this man to that woman and this woman to that man. Indeed, God makes these matches even before a child is conceived. Forty days before the formation of a child, a voice goes forth out of heaven to announce that this one will be wed to that one, and every match is as difficult for God to make as it was to part the waters of the Red Sea. And the angels watch over these matches, and when they go well, they sing out, \"God the Creator of the world and the Matchmaker, blessed be He now and forever.\"",
      "commentary": "This myth answers the question of what God has been doing since He completed the creation of the world — He has been making matches, and each one is a difficult task, as difficult to make as parting the waters of the Red Sea (if any task can be considered difficult for God). This makes God a shadkhan— a matchmaker. This myth also explains the Jewish concept of bashert, in which it is believed that each person has a bashert or destined one, and that the match was made in heaven. Such a belief made it easier to accept the matches that in practice were made by parents, usually with considerations of status and wealth rather than of any romantic factors. According to the Zohar, all souls are initially male and female. But when they are bom into this world, the male and female parts of the soul go their separate ways, the male soul in a male body and the female soul in a female body. If they are worthy, they will unite in marriage, restoring their original unity. That is why a person's loved one is called a soulmate, for together they form a single unit in every way, body and soul.",

      "number": 86,
      "title": "The Rabbis Overrule God",
      "content": "Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus was among the sages who were debating a point of the Law. All of the sages, except Rabbi Eliezer, ruled one way, and Rabbi Eliezer continued to insist that they were wrong. He used every possible argument to support it, but the others did not agree. Then he said: \"Let this carob tree prove that the Law is as I state it is.\" The carob tree then uprooted itself and moved a distance of one hundred ells. But the other sages said: \"That doesn't prove anything.\" Then Rabbi Eliezer said: \"Let the waters of the spring prove that I am right.\" Then the waters began to flow backward. But again the sages insisted that this, too, proved nothing. Then Rabbi Eliezer spoke again and said: \"Let the walls of the house of study prove I am right.\" And the walls were about to collapse when Rabbi Yehoshua said to them: \"If scholars are discussing a point of the Law, why should you walls interfere?\" Thus they did not fall, in deference to Rabbi Yehoshua, but neither did they straighten out, out of respect for Rabbi Eliezer, and they are inclined to this day. Rabbi Eliezer then said: \"If the Law is as I say, let heaven prove it.\" Thereupon a bat kol, a heavenly voice, came forth and said: \"Why do you quarrel with Rabbi Eliezer, whose opinion should prevail everywhere?\" Then Rabbi Yehoshua stood up and said: \"It [the Torah] is not in heaven \" (Deut. 30:12). \"What does this mean?\" asked Rabbi Yirmiyahu. \"It means that since the Torah was given to us on Mount Sinai, we no longer require a heavenly voice to reach a decision, since it is written in the Torah: Follow after the majority \" (Exod. 23:2). Later Rabbi Nathan encountered Elijah and asked him how the ruling was accepted on high. And Elijah said: \"At this the Holy One, blessed be He, laughed and said, 'My children have overruled me!'\" The subject of the disagreement between Rabbi Eliezer and the other rabbis was the ritual purity of a ceramic oven. Rabbi Eliezer insisted it was ritually pure, while all of the other sages said it was impure. It seems ironic that a series of miracles, with crucial implications about the relationship of God to the rabbis, took place because of a such a minor matter. This startling legend vividly demonstrates the rabbinic belief that once the Torah had been given on Mount Sinai, it became the possession of the Jews, and the responsibility for interpreting it fell to the rabbis. So extreme is this tale that it suggests that the rabbis were not willing to let any authority — even that of God — overrule them. And as the goda to the tale reveals, God seems to accept their determination to decide the Law as they see fit. Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, one of the great talmudic sages, disagrees with his fellow sages, and insists on his interpretation to the extent that he provokes miracles — the moving of the carob tree, the reversal of the waters of the spring, and the imminent collapse of the walls of the House of Study. Finally, he calls upon heaven to confirm the correctness of his interpretation — and heaven replies in his favor. None of this, however, deters the other rabbis from their interpretation. Instead, Rabbi Yehoshua virtually tells God to keep out of this matter, since, as he says, \" The Law is not in Heaven \" (Deut. 30: 12). And, indeed, the full context of this passage does in fact seem to shift the burden of responsibility for the interpretation of the Law from God to man: \" Surely ; this Instruction which I enjoin upon you this day is not too baffling for you , nor is it beyond reach. It is not in the heavens , that you should say ; ' Who among us can go up to the heavens and get it for us and impart it to us , that we may observe it?' Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say , 'Who among us can cross to the other side of the sea and get it for us and impart it to us, that we may observe it?' No, the thing is very close to you, in your mouth and in your heart, to observe it\" (Deut. 30:11-14). On the other hand, the biblical passage that serves as the basis of the assertion that the rabbis, and not God, must decide the Law, Follow after the majority , from Exodus 23:2, has had its meaning reversed from its original context: You shall not follow a multitude to do evil This interpretation of the biblical verse is itself a radical example of the rabbinic reinterpretation of the text. It demonstrates the extent of the rabbinic determination to assume all responsibility for the interpretation of the Law. See B. Sanhedrin 2a for a discussion of the verse from Exodus.",

      "title": "God Defers To The Earthly Court",
      "content": "All the ministering angels had gathered before God. \"Master of the Universe,\" they asked, \"what day is New Year's Day?\" God replied: \"Why are you asking Me? Let us, you and I, ask the earthly court. When the earthly court decrees that Today is Rosh ha-Shanah, the New Year/ then raise up the podium. Summon the advocates. Summon the clerks. For My children have decreed that today is New Year's Day, and what is a decree for Israel is an ordinance of the God of Jacob.\" The preceding entry, \"The Rabbis Overrule God,\" offers a startling example of rabbinic independence from God in matters of interpreting the Torah. Here God defers to the rabbis, to the great court of the Sanhedrin, out of respect. God demonstrates that in certain matters the opinions of the rabbis take precedence even of God. This is a much more conciliatory approach than that taken by Rabbi Yehoshua in \"The Rabbis Overrule God.\" Behind this myth is the rabbinic understanding that the Sabbath laws are fixed by God, but other holidays, based on the monthly calendar and sighting of the new moon, are up to the human courts. God's agreement in this matter is deduced from Psalms 81:4-5: Blow the horn on the new moon , on the full moon for our feast day. For it is a law for Israel a ruling of the God of Jacob. The latter verse about the law and ruling can be understood two ways: the statute and ordinance can be seen as a simple repetition, or a statement that God defers to Israel to such a great extent that God accepts all of Israel's laws as rulings binding on Himself. It is this latter interpretation that is at the root of this myth. Two versions of this myth are found in Midrash Tehillim. One version takes place as a dialogue between God and the angels, as found here, and the other takes the form of an announcement on the part of God. The latter adds a goda from God: If the witnesses of the new moon are delayed, everything required for the heavenly court will have to be stored away, and the New Year will be delayed until the next day. Here God is even ready to defer to human frailty, and to delay the starting of the New Year if necessary.",

      "content": "In the beginning, before the world was created, God rode upon the wings of the wind and upon the flames of storms. Fiery lights of crimson fire blazed around Him. Four great storm-winds swirled around Him. A tempest was His chariot, the storm-wind His seat. At that time the world was filled with water on water, wave on wave, gale on gale, tempest within tempest, storm-wind within storm-wind, making a great clamor until the word of God silenced them all. Then the sound of praise rose up from the waters, and God said to himself, \"If these that have neither mouth nor speech praise me, how much more will I be praised when man is created.\" So God gave his consent for the world to be created, as it is said. For He spoke and it came to be (Ps. 33:9).",
      "commentary": "This mythic portrait of God riding the storm-winds grows out of the passages: For behold Yahweh will come in fire, and like the storm-wind (Isa. 66:15), and. Fire goes before Him (Ps. 97:3). At the same time, the uncreated world is filled with water, based on the verse The voice of Yahweh was upon the waters (Ps. 29:3). Like a god out of Greek mythology, \"God rides upon the skies\" (Midrash Tehillim 68:3). God first calms the upheavals of the waters, and the creation of the world is said to come about after God receives the praise of the waters. The association of God with the stormwinds links the Jewish God with Marduk, also known as Bel, a god of thunderstorms, originally a Sumerian god taken over by the Babylonians, who rose from being a local god to become head of the Babylonian pantheon. According to Exodus Rabbah (15:22), there were three pre-existent elements: \"Three things preceded the creation of the world — water, wind and fire.\" These are the three elements found in this mythic description of God.",

      "id": "schwartz-prior-worlds",
      "number": 90,
      "title": "Prior Worlds",
      "content": "Before the world was created, God alone existed, one and eternal, beyond any boundary, without change or movement, concealed within Himself. When the thought arose in Him to bring the world into being. His glory became visible. He began to trace the foundations of a world before Himself, and in this way God brought a heaven and earth into being. But when God looked at them, they were not pleasing in His sight, so He changed them back into emptiness and void. He split and rent and tore them apart with his two arms, and ruined whole worlds in one moment. One after another, God created a thousand worlds, which preceded this one. And all of them were swept away in the wink of an eye. God went on creating worlds and destroying worlds until He created this one and declared, \"This one pleases me, those did not.\" That is how God created the heaven and the earth as we know it, as it is said, \"For, behold! I am creating a new heaven and a new earth\" (Isa. 65:17). The verse These are the generations of the heaven and the earth when they were created (Gen. 2:4) suggested to the rabbis the creation of prior worlds, while the verse You carry them away as with a flood (Ps. 90:5) was also interpreted to refer to the destruction of these prior worlds. The Zohar (1:262b) suggests that God did not actually build these prior worlds, but only thought about building them. That this world was not the first that God created was believed to be indicated by Isaiah 65:17: For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come to mind.\" Zohar Hadash identifies the prior worlds as totaling 1,000, as does Or ha-Hayim 1:12, which states that before God created this world. He created a thousand hidden worlds. These hidden worlds were created through the first letter, aleph. That is why the Torah, in the report of the Creation of this world, commences with the second letter, bet. The existence of the 1,000 worlds is linked to the verse You may have the thousand, O Solomon (S. of S. 8:12). Other sources, such as Midrash Tehillim 90:13, give the number as 974 worlds, which were said to have been created and destroyed over 2,000 years. Sefer ha-Zikhronot 1:1 suggests that when it entered God's mind to create the world. He drew the plan of the world, but it would not stand until God created repentance. Thus repentance is the key element that made our world possible. Rabbi Yitzhak Eizik Haver (1789-1853) found evidence of prior creations in the fact that the Torah starts with the letter bet, the second letter, rather than with an aleph, the first letter. \"The verse begins with the letter bet to hint that Creation was divided into two realms — that God created two beginnings.\" Although a great many prior worlds are said to have been created and destroyed. Rabbi Levi Yitzhak of Berditchev insisted that \"Everything God created exists forever, and never ceases to be.\" And in Esh Kadosh, Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira identifies the creation and destruction of the prior worlds with the Shattering of the Vessels. Furthermore, he states that God made the present universe out of those broken vessels. See \"The Shattering of the Vessels and Gathering the Sparks,\" p. 122. The belief that God destroyed the prior worlds implies that God's creations of these worlds was somehow in error. Some Christian apocryphal sources, such as The Gospel of Philip 99a, describe even the present world as an error: \"The world came into being through a mistake. For He who created it wished to create it imperishable and immortal. He did not attain his hope.\"",

Still others say that they too were created on the first day, along with heaven and earth. The very existence of pre-existing elements, such as light, darkness, chaos, void, water, wind, and the deep, raise doubts about the singularity of God's accomplishment. Yet there is no explicit mention of the creation of these elements in the account of Creation. To demonstrate that God did indeed create these elements. Rabbi Gamaliel in Genesis Rabbah provides prooftexts to show that all seven were created, such as in Isaiah 45:7, where God says, \"I form light and create darkness.\" However, this proof raises as many questions as it resolves. The use of the verb \"form\" (yotzer) for the creation of light and \"create\" ( borei ) for the creation of darkness is significant. Something that is formed already exists, while something that is created is brought into being. This seems to hint that light pre-existed.",

      "content": "God looked over the entire creation before it existed and prepared everything during the six days of Creation. During those six days the foundations and roots of everything that would be brought into being were created. So too did God create everything with its knowledge. God asked each thing if it wanted to be created. When each thing agreed to be created, it was with specific conditions, and with its own particular mode of service to God. The ocean agreed to open up to permit the children of Israel to pass through the Red Sea. The heavens promised to be silent while Moses climbed Mount Sinai. The sun and moon promised to stand still when Joshua stood before the walls of Jericho. The ravens promised to feed Elijah, the lions promised not to devour Daniel, the heavens promised to open up before Ezekiel, and the whale to cast out Jonah. In this way God made an agreement with each of the elements, and each and every one agreed to do as God asked, out of gratitude for having been created. There are some Jewish creation myths in which God created the world from a blueprint. That idea is echoed here, but instead of a plan it seems to suggest that God visualized, in some way, all that He would create. Philo states that \"when God decided to create this world. He first formed the invisible world to use as a pattern for the corporeal world.\" That idea is echoed here, suggesting that \"the roots of everything\" which God prepared was an invisible, archetypal world, or that God visualized, in some way, all that He would create. Other myths describe God using the Torah as a blueprint for all of Creation. See \"The Creation of the Torah,\" p. 249. In addition, we find the concept that God consulted with all of his creations, asking them if they wanted to be created. The implication is that all things subsequently created expressed their desire to exist. This explains the powerful impulse to survive in all living beings. God's questioning of the creatures prior to their creation implies a covenant between God and His creations, and implies a mutuality to the process of creation.",

      "content": "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Now the earth was unformed and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters. God said, \"Let there be light\"; and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, a first day. God said, \"Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water, that it may separate water from water.\" God made the expanse, and it separated the water that was below the expanse from the water that was above the expanse. And it was so. God called the expanse Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day. God said, \"Let the water below the sky be gathered into one area, that the dry land may appear.\" And it was so. God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering of waters He called Seas. And God saw that this was good. And God said, \"Let the earth sprout vegetation: seed-bearing plants, fruit trees of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in it.\" And it was so. The earth brought forth vegetation: seed-bearing plants of every kind, and trees of every kind bearing fruit with the seed in it. And God saw that this was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a third day. God said, \"Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate day from night; they shall serve as signs for the set times — the days and the years; and they shall serve as lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth.\" And it was so. God made the two great lights, the greater light to dominate the day and the lesser light to dominate the night, and the stars. And God set them in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth, to dominate the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that this was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day. God said, \"Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and birds that fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.\" God created the great sea monsters, and all the living creatures of every kind that creep, which the waters brought forth in swarms, and all the winged birds of every kind. And God saw that this was good. God blessed them, saying, \"Be fertile and increase, fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.\" And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day. God said, \"Let the earth bring forth every kind of living creature: cattle, creeping things, and wild beasts of every kind.\" And it was so. God made wild beasts of every kind and cattle of every kind, and all kinds of creeping things of the earth. And God saw that this was good. And God said, \"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. They shall rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the cattle, the whole earth, and all the creeping things that creep on earth.\" And God created man in His image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. God blessed them and God said to them, \"Be fertile and increase, fill the earth and master it; and rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and all the living things that creep on earth.\" God said, \"See, I give you every seed-bearing plant that is upon all the earth, and every tree that has seed-bearing fruit; they shall be yours for food. And to all the animals on land, to all the birds of the sky, and to everything that creeps on earth, in which there is the breath of life, I give all the green plants for food.\" And it was so. And God saw all that He had made, and found it very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day. The heaven and the earth were finished, and all their array. On the seventh day God finished the work that He had been doing, and He ceased on the seventh day from all the work that He had done. And God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy, because on it God ceased from all the work of Creation that He had done. Such is the story of heaven and earth when they were created.",
      "commentary": "This is the most famous of all Jewish creation myths. It appears at the very beginning of Genesis and is known, at least in rough outline, even by those who have little knowledge of the Bible. The only biblical account that is equally famous is that of the disobedience of Adam and Eve. This Creation narrative emphasizes God's use of the power of the word in order to create the world. On each day of Creation, additional elements are brought into being when God commands that they appear. On the surface this seems to be creation ex nihilo, out of nothing, but a close reading of the biblical text shows a certain amount of ambiguity about whether God drew on pre-existing elements or created everything Himself. Every subsequent Jewish creation myth refers directly or indirectly to this one. It either verifies the principles established here, or contradicts them, implying, for example, that some elements, such as light, already existed when God said, \"Let there be light\" (Gen. 1:3). See \"Light from the Temple,\" p. 411, where this theory is elaborated. Following the seven days of Creation is a second creation myth. Genesis 2:4-25, which offers a different perspective on the events of Creation, emphasizing the creation of man and woman. Scholars have proposed that these were two separate creation myths that were combined by the priestly editors of Genesis, despite some apparent contradictions. See \"The Creation of Man,\" p. 133, and \"The Creation of Woman,\" p. 142. This seminal creation myth also had a great influence on the way God was conceived. It can be argued that the personification of God begins in Genesis 1:2: God said , \" Let there be light \" Since humans also speak, using language just as God is said to do, it was natural to assume that God had other human characteristics. As a result of this myth, it has been assumed that all God's creations came into existence through the words uttered by God, as made explicit in this passage from Psalms: By the word of Yahweh the heavens were made , by the breath of His mouth , all their hosts (Ps. 33:6). There are many parallels between the Genesis Creation myth and the creation myths of other peoples of the ancient Near East. One of the closest is the Mesopotamian creation myth found in Enuma Elish, where the divine assembly of Mesopotamia is created through the merging of Apsu, divine patron of fresh water, and Tiamat, divine patron of salt water. An Egyptian creation myth is preserved in the Hymn to Ra, the creator and ruler identified with the sun, where Ra describes creation: \"There were no heavens and no earth. There was no dry land and there were no reptiles in the land. Then I spoke and living creatures appeared.\" A seven-day incubation ritual is described in the Ugaritic stories of Aqhat.

Each of them belongs to God, from objects linked to God, such as the rainbow and the sword, to God's arm, which is part of God, and powers and characteristics of God, such as His might and His jealousy. This brief, largely undeveloped myth serves as a reminder of God's unlimited powers, which can be asserted at any time, with unforeseen consequences.

So too did He establish the earth upon its foundations that it should never be moved, and He covered it with the deep. But when the waters rose up above the mountains, God rebuked them and they fled at the voice of His thunder. The mountains rose, the valleys sank down to the place where God had founded them. And He set a boundary for the waters that could not be crossed, that they might not return to cover the earth.",
      "commentary": "This is an especially important passage from Psalms, which demonstrates clear evidence of ancient creation myths beyond those found in Genesis. This version of the Creation gives God a more active, mythic role. God stretches out the heavens, lays the roof of His upper chambers, establishes the earth on its foundations, and covers it with the deep. Even the creation of light is described in very active terms, with God covering Himself with light as with a garment. In contrast, in the Genesis creation myth God's actions are limited to speech — God speaks and everything comes into existence. Thus the portrayal of God in this myth from Psalms is far closer to that of polytheism, as found in Babylonian, Canaanite, and Greek myth. For additional myths about the creation of light, see \"The Light of the First Day,\" p. 83.",

God revealed the rainbow to Noah as the sign of the covenant between them. The rainbow had been designated for this purpose from the time of its creation. God said, \"I have set My bow in the clouds\" (Gen. 9:13), meaning that the beauty of the bow was comparable to that of God. Still, as beautiful as the rainbow was, it was but a faint reflection of God's glory. It is forbidden to stare at the rainbow because the Shekhinah appears in it, adorned in garments yellow, red, and white. That is why the eyes of anyone who stares at the rainbow will become dim.",

Whoever speculates about four things, it is better if he had not been bom: What is above? What is below? What came before? And what will come after? There is little speculation in Jewish lore about what God did before He created the world, or what, if anything, existed before then. The one major exception are the myths about prior worlds. See \"Prior Worlds,\" p. 71. So too is little said about God's decision to create the world when He did. But Me' am Lo'ez emphasizes God's own free will in deciding when to undertake Creation, \"at the precise instant that He desired to do so.\" According to Jewish philosophy, while human free will may be encumbered by a person's fate, God's free will is limitless, and His decision to create the universe and make a covenant with Israel was entirely God's own choice. The only exception seems to be some strata of Lurianic Kabbalah where the process of creation /emanation seems to be a necessity within God, although His free will initiates the whole process. This famous quotation from Mishnah Hagigah 2:1 lists four things it is forbidden to speculate about. It represents that dimension of rabbinic thought that was alarmed at even the study of mystical contemplation, and warned against its dangers. Indeed, the tale of the four sages who entered Paradise, from B. Hagigah 14b, is itself a warning tale about the dangers of mystical explorations. See \"The Four Who Entered Paradise,\" p. 173.",

      "content": "How did God create the heavens? Some say that God wrapped Himself in a prayer shawl, a tallit of light, and the light cast from that prayer shawl suffused the world. That garment of light was covered with the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, inscribed in black fire on white fire. Others say that God draped the six days of Creation around Himself like a gown and dazzled the universe with His glory from one end to the other. Then there are those who say that God took the light and stretched it like a garment, and the heavens continued to expand until God said, \"Enough!\" God said , \" Let there be light.\" And there was light (Gen. 1:3). This enigmatic verse raises as many questions as it answers. Did God create this light out of nothing, or did this light pre-exist? This question receives a number of answers in rabbinic sources, all of them based on interpretations of Psalms 104:2: Who cover Yourself with light as with a garment , who stretches out the heavens like a curtain. One such interpretation grows out of a dialogue between Rabbi Simeon ben Jehozadak and Rabbi Samuel bar Nachman in Genesis Rabbah 3:4. Rabbi Simeon asked the other, \"How did God create light?\" Rabbi Samuel replied in a whisper that God wrapped himself in a white garment, and when Rabbi Simeon noted that this explanation is found in Psalms 104:2 (and is therefore not esoteric, requiring a whisper). Rabbi Samuel explained: \"I received this tradition in a whisper, so I passed it on in a whisper.\" Why would this teaching have been conveyed in a whisper? Because it hints that the light somehow pre-existed. This would imply that while God was the Creator, He created using existing building blocks, which might be viewed as diminishing God's accomplishment. In addition, there is a Gnostic interpretation in which the light of God's garment is identified with the First Created Being. See \"The First Created Being,\" p. 118. This interpretation would certainly justify the use of a whisper. The view that light itself was a kind of primordial element, along with darkness, chaos, and void ( tohu and vohu ), is found in \"Light from the Temple,\" p. 411. Such an interpretation is also found in Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 6, which interprets the verse from Psalms 104:2 to mean that God took of an existing light and stretched it out to create the world: \"How were the heavens created? From the light of the garment with which God was robed. He took this light and stretched it like a garment and the heavens began to extend until He said, 'Enough!'\" Another verse used to explain God's wearing of a garment at the time of the Creation is Psalms 104:1: You are clothed with glory and majesty. This is said to be the first of ten occasions in which God clothed himself in a garment (Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 22:5).",

      "content": "Before the world was created, the thought arose in God's mind to create a light to illuminate it. So on the first day of Creation, God wrapped Himself in a garment of light, and the radiance of His majesty illuminated the world. That was the light of the first day, a primordial light, distinct from the light of the fourth day, when God created the sun, the moon, and the stars. That light was the first thing that God created and it completely suffused all of existence without beginning or end. Everything was filled with that light, which traveled throughout the cosmos without stopping, until all the world began to sing. Thus it is written. He sends it forth under the whole heaven , , and His light to the ends of the earth (Job 37:3). The light created on the first day accompanied all the days of Creation, and thus all the days are contained in the first day, for the world was created through that sacred light. It is the light of the eye. In that light Adam saw from one end of the universe to the other, and he was also able to view the world from the beginning of Creation until the end. For it was not only possible to see tangible things in this light, but even ethereal things, which are otherwise invisible. Where did the light come from? Some say it was the light of Paradise, which God brought into the world at the time of Creation. For the first three days and nights, the primordial light shone undiminished. Seven times brighter than the sun, it was so intense that no created thing could gaze upon it. Others say that the light existed even before the Creation. When God said, \"Let there be light , \" light came forth from the place in the universe where the Temple in Jerusalem would one day be built. Surrounded by that light, God completed the creation of the world. How, then, did God bring the light into the world? Some say that God wrapped himself in a prayer shawl of light, and the light cast from that prayer shawl suffused the world. Others say that God draped the six days of Creation around Himself like a gown and dazzled the universe with His glory from one end to the other. Then there are those who say that God took the light and stretched it like a garment, and the heavens continued to expand until God said, \"Enough!\" Still others say that the light was cast from the very countenance of God. How long did the light shine? Some say that the light of the first day accompanied all seven days of Creation, and all the days that followed contain the essence of the first. Therefore the light of the first day is still with us, dimmed though it may be. Others say that this light shone undiminished for the first three days and nights of Creation. Seven times brighter than the sun, the primordial light was so intense that no created thing could gaze upon it. Still others say that the light created on the first day served thirty-six hours, twelve on the Sabbath eve, twelve on the Sabbath day, and twelve on the night of the Sabbath. That sacred light pervaded the world until the very moment that Adam and Eve tasted the forbidden fruit. Then the first thing they lost was that precious light, for God, seeing the wicked deeds of the coming generations, hid the primordial light at once. Without it, the world grew dark around them, for the sun shone like a candle in comparison. Never again did they see the world in the splendor of that light, and that was the most painful punishment of all. As for the fate of the primordial light, some say that God brought it back into Paradise, where it awaits the righteous in the World to Come. On the other hand, that light will be denied to the wicked, as it is said. The light of the wicked is withheld (Job 38:15). Others say that God gave that light as a gift to His Bride, the Shekhinah. Still others say that God hid that light in the Torah, in the mysteries concealed there, waiting to be discovered. And wherever the Torah is studied, a thread of this light is drawn down upon those who study it, as it is said. Light is sown for the righteous (Psalms 97:11). And when it is, the hidden light of the Torah is revealed to them in all its splendor. Still others say that the light has continued to exist since the days of Adam, but that God has hidden it, so that the wicked will be unable to misuse it. For had it been completely removed, the world would not continue to exist for even one moment. Instead, it is concealed and the world is sustained. Not a day passes without some of this light being emitted to the world so that it can continue to exist. This is how God nourishes the world, for God has saved this light for the righteous at the End of Days, when the footsteps of the Messiah will be heard. Had the primordial light been completely concealed, the world would not continue to exist for even one moment. So too is it said that God hid a small bit of that light inside a glowing stone, and gave it to Adam and Eve when they were expelled from the Garden, as a reminder of all that they had lost. At the End of Days, when the footsteps of the Messiah will be heard in the world, that sacred light will be restored. Then everyone will see the true glory of God's creation.

      "content": "Light was the very first creation on the first day; thus light was the first cloak in which God concealed His spiritual essence, as it is said. Cloaked in light as with a garment (Ps. 104:2). Some say that God created the angels out of that primal light. For angels are a pure spiritual force radiating light, and the angels surround God the way a cloak envelops whoever wears it. The extensive rabbinic tradition about the or ha-ganuz, the primordial light that has since been concealed, is frequently linked to Creation, in that the light is regarded as the first manifestation of the God's essence. Here the creation of light is directly linked to the creation of the angels, and the angels are viewed as being a spiritual essence consisting entirely of light. Psalm 104 contains fragments of ancient Jewish creation myths. See Psalm 104:1-9. Also, see \"The Light of the First Day,\" p. 83, and \"The Creation of Angels,\" p. 115.",

      "number": 109,
      "title": "The Tzohar",
      "content": "When the world was first created, God filled the world with a sacred light, known as the primordial light. This was the light that came into being when God said , \" Let there be light\" (Gen. 1:3). It was not the light of the sun, for that did not come into being until the fourth day, when God created the sun and the moon and the stars. It was a miraculous light by which it was possible for Adam to see from one end of the world to the other. When Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, the first thing they lost was that precious light. Without it, the world seemed dark to them, for the sun shone like a candle in comparison. But God preserved one small part of that precious light inside a glowing stone, and the angel Raziel delivered this stone to Adam after they had been expelled from the Garden of Eden, as a token of the world they had left behind. This jewel, known as the Tzohar, sometimes glowed brightly and sometimes was dim. As he lay on his deathbed, Adam gave the jewel to his son Seth, who passed it down to the righteous Enoch. Enoch grew in wisdom until he was taken into Paradise in a chariot, and transformed into the angel Metatron, the heavenly scribe and Prince of the treasuries of heaven. Before departing this world, Enoch gave the Tzohar to his son, Methuselah. Methuselah slept in its glowing light, and some say that is why he lived longer than anyone else. Methuselah passed on the jewel to his son Lamech, who gave it to his son, Noah, who brought it with him on the ark. Indeed, God instructed Noah to do so when he said, \" Put the Tzohar in the ark\" (Gen. 6:16). Noah hung it on the deck, and for forty days and nights it illumined the ark. Noah determined whether it was day or night by gauging the brilliance of the stone. It was dim during the day, but it shone brightly at night. When the ark landed on Mount Ararat, the first thing Noah did was to plant grapes, and when they grew ripe, he made wine and became drunk, and at that moment the Tzohar fell from where it had been hung in the ark, rolled into the water, and sank to the bottom of the sea. There it was carried by the currents until it came to rest in an underwater cave. Years later, after the waters had subsided, the child Abraham was bom in that cave. His mother had gone there to give birth, to escape King Nimrod's decree that all newborn boys be put to death. For Nimrod had seen a sign that a child bom at that time would overthrow him. After giving birth, Abraham's mother grew afraid for the safety of her family, and at last she abandoned the infant in the cave and returned home. Then the angel Gabriel descended to the cave and fed the infant with his thumb, through which milk and honey flowed, and because he was fed in that miraculous way, the boy began to grow at the rate of a year every day. And on the third day, while exploring the cave, he found a stone glowing in one of the crevices of the cave. Then the angel, who knew how precious it was, put it on a chain, and hung it around Abraham's neck. Thirteen days later Abraham's mother returned to the cave, for she could not put the fate of the infant out of her mind. She expected to find that the child was no longer living, but instead she found a grown boy, who said that he was her child. She refused to believe it at first, but when he showed her the glowing stone and the sacred light it cast, she cam e to believe that a miracle had taken place. Abraham wore that glowing jewel all the days of his life. Whoever was ill and looked into that stone soon healed, and it also served as an astrolabe to study the stars. Before his death, Abraham gave that glowing jewel to Isaac, and Isaac gave it to Jacob at the time he gave him the stolen blessing. For Isaac had intended to give the glowing stone to Esau, but Rebecca, who was a seer, knew well that it was destined to belong to Jacob. Jacob was wearing the Tzohar when he dreamed of the ladder reaching to heaven, with angels ascending and descending on it. And he, in turn, gave the stone to his beloved son, Joseph, when he gave him the coat of many colors. Jacob made Joseph promise to wear the stone at all times, but he did not reveal its power, which he knew well. And because Joseph's brothers did not know that the amulet was precious, they did not take it from him when they stripped him of the coat of many colors and cast him naked into the dark pit. Now snakes and scorpions lived at the bottom of that pit. And when Joseph heard them slithering and creeping in the dry leaves, he shivered in the darkness at the bottom of the pit. All at once a light began to glow, and Joseph saw that it was coming from the amulet he wore around his neck. And as long as Joseph remained in that pit, the jewel continued to glow, so that he was never afraid. At last Joseph heard Midianite traders calling out to him from the top of that pit. They pulled him out of the pit and brought him to Egypt, where they sold him into slavery and to the destiny that fate held for him, which was to become Prince of Egypt. When Joseph was imprisoned in the dungeon, he discovered that if he placed the Tzohar inside his cup and peered into it, he could read the future and interpret dreams. That is how he interpreted the dreams of the butler and baker, and later the dreams of Pharaoh that prophesied the seven years of famine. It was that same cup that Joseph hid in the saddlebags of Benjamin, about which his servant said, \"It is the very one from which my master drinks and which he uses for divination\" (Gen. 44:5). That cup, with the precious jewel in it, was placed inside Joseph's coffin at the time of his death, and it remained there until Moses recovered Joseph's coffin and was told in a dream to take out the glowing stone and hang it in the Tabernacle, where it became known as the Ner Tamid, the Eternal Light. And that is why, even to this day, an Eternal Light bums above every Ark of the Torah in every synagogue. This tale is a classic example of a chain midrash — a series of midrashim that are linked to each other by a common object or character. The object here is the glowing stone known as the Tzohar. This myth builds on that of the primordial light that God brought into being on the first day of Creation. See \"The Light of the First Day,\" p. 83. The word \"Tzohar\" only appears once in the Torah, when God instructs Noah on how to build the ark and tells him \"Put the Tzohar in the ark\" (Gen. 6:16). For this reason there is uncertainty about its meaning. Rashi's comments on Genesis 6:16 observe that some say the Tzohar was a window (or an opening, a skylight, or a dome — THE PRIMORDIAL LKkHT 87 implying that it should admit light into the ark) and others say that it was a precious stone. Virtually all other midrashim adopt the view that it was some kind of precious stone. Targum Yonathan paraphrases Genesis 6:16 to read, \"Go to the river Pishon and take a brilliant stone from there and place it into the ark, to illuminate it for you.\" Midrash Aggadah states that God commanded Noah to bring a diamond with him on the ark, to give them light, for the world will have grown dark. \"Tzohar\" is probably linked to tzoharayim, the Hebrew word for \"noon.\" The sound of the word is suggestive of z ohar, which means \"splendor\" or \"illumination,\" and is the title of the central text of Jewish mysticism. What seems clear is that it indicated some kind of light, whether shining through a window or reflected from a glowing jewel. The need for a jewel arises because of the likelihood that dark clouds covered the world during the days and nights of the Flood, and therefore no light would shine through a window. This follows the tradition that during the time of die Flood, day and night were indistinguishable ( Genesis Kabbah 25:2, 34:11; Rashi on Genesis 8:22). Not only did darkness cover the earth during the 40 days and nights of the Flood, but the planets ceased to function. How is this known? Because at the time of the covenant of the rainbow, God promised Noah, \"So long as earth exists ... day and night shall not cease\" (Gen. 8:22). From this it can be deduced that day and night were indistinguishable for the duration of the Flood, and that the heavenly bodies ceased to function. The legend of the glowing gem that Noah hung in the ark is found in Genesis Rabbah 31:11: \"During the whole 12 months that Noah was in the ark he did not require the light of the sun by day or the light of the moon by night, but he had a polished gem which he hung up: when it was dim he knew that it was day, and when it shone he knew that it was night.\" Noah used this information to know when to feed the animals at their customary times. This jewel is linked to the myth that God gave a jewel to Adam and Eve at the time they were cast out of the Garden of Eden, to remind them of all they had lost. The midrash then links this jewel to the genealogy between Adam and Noah, as well as that beginning with Abraham and the subsequent generations, until the time of the Temple. The story of the precious stone of Abraham is found in B. Bava Batra 16b. This account offers an alternate fate for the precious stone, saying, \"When Abraham passed away from the world, the Holy One, blessed be He, hung it on the wheel of the sun.\" The legend about Joseph in the pit is found in Midrash Aseret Harugei Malkhut. The story of Joseph's cup being carried off by his brothers is found in Genesis 44:5. The Ner Tamid or Eternal Light is first mentioned in Exodus 27:20: You shall further instruct the Israelites to bring you clear oil of beaten olives for lighting, for kindling lamps regularly. Every Jewish synagogue contains such a light which is kept lit at all times.",
      "commentary": "This myth evolves out of an attempt to resolve two problems in the biblical text: the nature of the light of the first day of Creation, before the creation of the sun and moon and stars, and the meaning of Tzohar in the passage about building the ark. The midrash explains that the light of the first day was a sacred light, which, according to some accounts, was cast from God's garment of light, and, according to others, was reflected from the robe of the Shekhinah . See \"The Light of the First Day,\" p. 83. The vehicle of the chain midrash makes it possible for it to be transmitted from Adam to Noah, and then from Noah to Abraham and the other patriarchs. In Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer, 10, a Tzohar ~\\ike pearl is described as having been suspended in the belly of the whale, where it was said to have shone as brightly as the sun at noon. It showed Jonah all that was in the sea and in the depths. According to the Zohar, Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai also had possession of the Tzohar : \"Our companion. Bar Yohai, has a jewel, a precious stone, and I have looked upon the light emitted by it, and it is like die light of the sun, illuminating the whole world. This light extends from the heavens to the earth, and will continue to illumine the world until the Ancient of Days comes, and sits upon His throne\" ( Zohar l:lla-llb). The Tzohar also appears in various Jewish folk and Hasidic tales, usually in the form of a glowing jewel found in some accidental way. See \"The Soul of the Avi,\" about an eggshaped glowing jewel, in Gabriel’s Palace, p. 258. It is possible that J. R. R. Tolkien made use of some of the legends about the Tzohar in The Silmarillion, in which the central motif concerns jewels containing the last of a primordial light.",

      "title": "How Light And Darkness Were Created",
      "content": "Before any visible beings came into existence, there were only invisible beings. Then God decided to create a visible creation. So God said, \"Let one of the invisible things descend and become visible.\" And Adoil, one of the invisible things, descended. He was extremely large, and in his belly he had a great light. God said to Adoil, \"Disintegrate yourself, Adoil, and let what is bom from you become visible.\" And Adoil disintegrated himself, and out came a very great light. And God was in the midst of the light, and a light came forth out of that light and revealed all the creation that God had thought to create. And God saw that it was good. And God placed a throne for himself, and sat down on it. And then God spoke to the light and said, \"You rise up and become the foundation for the highest things. For there is nothing higher than light, except for nothingness itself.\" And God summoned the very lowest beings for a second time, and said, \"Let one of the invisible beings descend and become visible.\" And Arkhas came out, solid and heavy and very red. And God said to Arkhas, open yourself up, Arkhas, and let what is bom from you become visible.\" And Arkhas disintegrated himself, and a great darkness emerged from him, very large, bearing the creation of all lower things. And God saw how good it was. And God said to the darkness, \"Descend and become the foundation of all lower things. For there is nothing lower than the darkness, except nothing itself.\" Then God took some light and some darkness and mixed them together, and commanded them to thicken, and when they did. He wrapped them with light, and spread it out, and it became water. And God spread it out above the darkness and below the light, dividing the world above from the world below. And God made a foundation of light around the waters, with seven circles inside it, with the appearance of crystal. And he pointed out the route of each one of the seven stars to its own heaven. And God made a division between the light and the darkness, and said to the light that it should be day, and to darkness that it should be night. And there was evening and there was morning, a first day (Gen. 1:5). This astonishing creation myth from 2 Enoch dates from around the second century bce to the first century ce. It portrays a version of the creation of light and darkness that is radically different from that found in Genesis. Here the earliest manifestation of existence occurs when God commands two invisible beings, Adoil and Arkhas, to give birth to light and darkness, which come to serve as the upper and lower foundations of the world. Adoil and Arkhas are primordial beings — not angels or gods, but invisible forces entirely under God's command. And it is God who commands that they descend and become visible. Of particular interest is God's command to Adoil and Arkhas that they disintegrate themselves, suggesting that their disintegration makes possible the subsequent births that take place. When they do, a great light comes forth from Adoil, while Arkhas gives birth to darkness. This myth is an interesting parallel to that of the Ari about the Shattering of the Vessels. In both cases a kind of breaking apart is required before anything can be created. See \"The Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks/' p. 122.",

      "content": "In His wondrous hidden way, God contracted His light again and again until physical bodies were created. Thus God's kingdom has dominion over all, for all the world is but an emanation of His light. Here Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira reinterprets the kabbalistic concept of tzimtzum so that it refers not to God's contraction of Himself, but to God's contraction of light, and through this process the physical word is made manifest. This is also a sefirotic myth, in which each subsequent contraction of God leads to the next sefirah. Thus two primary kabbalistic concepts stand behind this brief yet original myth created by Rabbi Shapira, a twentieth century rabbi who perished in the Warsaw Ghetto. The existence of this myth is evidence of the continued myth-making process in Judaism into our own time.",

Only the narrow end of the funnel enters the flask. In this way the light from above diminishes and contracts until it takes the form of the spirit that inspired the prophets. It is then diminished further until all that remains in the present generation is a small spark of prophecy. A rabbinic principle holds that the spirit of prophecy available to the patriarchs was greatly reduced in the time of the prophets, and subsequently was reduced still further, until it is said that a dream is one sixtieth of prophecy. This follows the general belief that the true giants of humanity existed in the distant past, and our generation is removed from the true sources of prophetic inspiration.

Then the pillars of heaven trembled; they were awe-struck by His divine shout (Job 26:11), and after that they remained fixed in one place. This midrash attempts to explain why God created the heavens on the first day (Gen. 1:1), but He did not create the firmament until the second day (Gen. 1:7). Although the only description in Genesis about God's voice states that \"God said,\" (Gen. 1:3), this myth goes beyond the text of Genesis by insisting that God's voice was a shout, and the power of this shout was so great that the pillars of heaven solidified and ever since have remained firmly in place. The use of \"shout,\" even more than \"said,\" suggests a powerful personification of God. It also suggests a strong parallel with Greek and Canaanite gods, who also display similar human characteristics.",

Some say He took two balls, one of fire, the other of snow, kneaded them together, and worked them into one. Others say there were four balls, one for each of the four comers of the world. Still others insist there were six balls, one for each of the four comers and one for above and one for below. It is also said that God took two elements, chaos and void, and combined them together. For they were the elements out of which darkness and water were created, and from darkness and water the world was brought into being. Still others say that when God decided to create the world. He brought a single spark out of the primal darkness, and blew upon it, until it was kindled. And He brought out of the recesses of the deep a single drop, and He joined them together, and with them He created the world. Creation by elements is a common theme in rabbinic sources. Sometimes these elements are said to have preceded Creation, as in this case, where they are identified as tohu and vohu, chaos and void. Other legends suggest that the world was created out of water, wind, and fire: \"Three creations preceded the creation of this world: water, wind, and fire. Water conceived and gave birth to thick darkness. Fire conceived and gave birth to light. Wind conceived and gave birth to wisdom. Thus is the world maintained by these six creations: by wind and darkness, by fire and light, by water and wisdom\" ( Exodus Rabbah 15:22). However, Genesis Rabbah 1:9 reminds us that these primeval elements were created by God, and were not eternal: \"A certain philosopher said to Rabbi Gamaliel: 'Your God was indeed a great artist, but He found good materials which assisted Him.' 'What are they?' Rabbi Gamaliel asked. 'Tohu,",

Then the heavens went on expanding until God told them to stop. So too did God bless each of the four corners of the heavens. From the east the light of the world goes forth, and from the south the dew of blessings descends upon the land. From the west come the stores of snow and hail, heat and cold, while the rain that falls for the benefit of the land comes from the north. Tractate Hagigah of the Talmud describes the world expanding like a roll of thread or rope at the beginning of Creation, until God rebuked it and brought it to a standstill. This interpretation is based on the verse The pillars of heaven were trembling , but they became astonished at His rebuke (Job 26:11). There is a similar myth about God rebuking the sea when it was created and causing it to dry up. This derives from the verse He rebukes the sea and dries it up (Nah. 1:4). See \"The Rebellion of the Waters,\" p. 105. See also \"God's Shout,\" p. 90, where God delivers a similar rebuke, which causes the pillars of heaven to harden, holding up the firmament.",

      "commentary": "Some say that the generations of heaven and earth were created by the letter heh , which appears twice in God's Name. Others say that God used the first two letters of his Name, yod and he, to create the world. But most say that God used all four letters of His Name when He began to create heaven and earth. The powers attributed to the four-letter Name of God are limitless. The Maharal was said to have pronounced the Name in order to bring the Golem of Prague, a man made out of clay, to life. Rabbi Judah the Pious used the Name to bring a dead man to life, in order to testify as to who had killed him. This myth asserts that God's Name — YHVH — was the instrument by which the world was created. Further, the role of the individual letters of the Name is debated, and whether or not all four of them took part in Creation. See \"The God of Our Fathers,\" p. 25 and \"The Tetragrammaton,\" p. 27 for a further discussion of the Tetragrammaton.",

This myth is found in a hymn from Hekhalot Rabbati , also known as the \"Greater Hekhalot/' one of the primary Hekhalot texts describing heavenly journeys. In this unusual myth, creation is described as having been kindled by God's beauty. Other myths portray God in an active manner, either speaking, as in Genesis, or shouting, or smashing elements together with His hands. But here it is God's attribute of beauty that is identified as the creative element that gives birth to the creation of the world.

For God is always thinking and always creating. Without a counselor— for who else was there?— and making use of His own powers, God's will created this visible world. God used His Logos as an instrument with which to divide the formless expanse to create the world. Even if the world is now immortal through the providence of God, there was a time when it was not. But God, of course, is eternally existent, always has existed, and always will. Here Philo presents his theory that God did not stop after creating the world, but has continued to create it ever since. This engages the theological question of what God's actions have been since He completed the creation of the world. In Philo's view the work of Creation is an ongoing process.

      "commentary": "This is the key kabbalistic creation myth in the Zohar, found near the beginning of the book. It is both a mystical commentary on Genesis 1:1 and a creation myth of its own, as well as the primary myth describing the process of emanation of the ten sefirot. As a creation myth, it draws on the cosmic egg type of myth, in this case creation from a cosmic seed that takes root in the primordial womb. Unstated, but suggested, is the mythic image of a divine womb, and the hint of a goddess figure who gives birth to the world. At the same time, this myth functions in the Zohar as an alternate creation myth, that of creation by emanation, as performed through the ten sefirot. It proposes that the world emanated from the highest, unknowable part of God known as Ein Sof, the Endless, in a series of emanations, each identified with one of the ten sefirot. The language of the Zohar in presenting this myth is extremely allusive, symbolic, and cloaked in mystery. It is possible to see this myth as a key influence in the famous myth of the Ari of \" The Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks,\" which draws on the central image of the spark. Indeed, the Ari's myth can be viewed as an imaginative retelling of the myth of the cosmic seed. In \"Kabbalah and Myth,\" Gershom Scholem comments about this myth: \"It is the world seed . . . which is sown in the primordial womb of the \"supernal' mother. . . . Fertilized in this womb, the world seed through her emanates the other seven potencies, which the kabbalists interpret as the archetypes of all Creation, but also as the seven 'first days' of the first chapter of Genesis, or in other words as the original stages of intradivine development.\"",

God then took snow from beneath His Throne of Glory and cast it upon the waters, and the waters froze and became the dust of the earth, and God blessed it, so that it became fruitful and multiplied. Thus the earth stands upon the waters. The waters stand upon pillars of mountains. The pillars of mountains stand upon the wind. The wind stands upon the whirlwind, and God made the whirlwind like an amulet hung from His arm.",
      "commentary": "This myth explains how land was created when the whole earth was covered with water. An alternate explanation in Pesikta Rabbati 48:2 states that \"Primeval waters covered the whole world. What did God do? Some say He emptied them into that which was already full. Others say He pressed down upon them, so to speak, and made them gather into one great sea.\" This, then, is a divine miracle, in which God pours water into water that was already full, and it does not overflow. A later text in Midrash Konen greatly elaborates on the chain of images in this text: \"The earth is stretched out upon the waters, and the waters on pillars of hashmal, and the pillars of hashmal on the Mountain of Hailstones, and the Mountain of Hailstones on the Storehouses of Snow, and the Storehouses of Snow on the Storehouses of Water and Fire, and the Storehouses of Water on the sea, and the sea on the deep ( tehom ), and the deep on chaos ( tohu ), and chaos on the void (vohu), and the void stands upon the sea, and the sea stands on the sweet waters, and the sweet waters stand on the mountains, and the mountains stand on the wind, and the wind on the wings of storm, and the storm is tied to the heavens, and the heavens are suspended from the arm of the Holy One, blessed be He.\" In Merkavah Rabbah, it is not just the whirlwind that hangs like an amulet from God's arm, but the universe itself, based on the verse. And beneath His arm — the universe (Deut. 33:27). The transformation of snow into water is linked with Job 37:6, For He says to the snow, \" Become earth,\" while the ending echoes the biblical phrase. The arm of Yahweh has been revealed (Isa. 53:1).",

With these. He created everything in this world. He directed each of the three craftsmen to produce the creations necessary for the world. He bid water produce earth, commanding the waters to gather in one place. The waters did as they were commanded and that is when dry land appeared, as it is said, \" Let the water below the sky be gathered into one area, that the dry land may appear'\" (Gen. 1:9). Then God called upon the earth to produce its creations — animals and other living creatures. And the earth did as it was commanded, as it is said, \" Let the earth bring forth every kind of living creature\" (Gen. 1:24). So too did God call upon the earth to produce vegetation and plants. And the earth did so, as it is said, \" Let the earth sprout vegetation: seed-bearing plants, fruit trees of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in it\" (Gen. 1:11). And God called upon the waters to produce swarms of fish and birds, as it is said, \" Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and birds that fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky\" (Gen. 1:20). God then called upon the heavens to make a separation between the upper waters and the lower waters, as it is said, \"Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters\" (Gen. 1:6), and it was done. Then God called upon the heavens to illuminate the earth, as it is said, \"Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens\" (Gen. 1:14), and this, too, was accomplished. But when it was time to create man, God said, \"None of you is able to produce this creature alone. All of you must unite, and I too will join you. Together we shall make man.\" So God joined with the three craftsmen in creating man, and God gave him a soul.",
      "commentary": "This myth embellishes the Genesis creation myth, personifying heaven, earth, and water, and attributing the creations of the earth to them, acting at God's command. Thus God delegates His powers to these personified forces, and the actual work of Creation comes from them, instead of from the word of God. This indicates a remythologizing process, moving away from the abstraction of creation by the word toward creation by primordial forces. One of the primary rabbinic debates about Creation centers on whether or not God had any assistance. Just as the angels are said to have assisted God in some roles of Creation, the elements are personified as celestial entities, virtually as lesser gods, who were created to carry out God's orders. But in doing so they play an active role in the work of Creation. This detracts from the stunning totality of God's accomplishment. In other myths, God does not depend on assistance from other celestial beings or on the existence of some kind of pre-existent elements, such as darkness and light, water, earth, and heaven. In De Somniis 1:76, Philo identifies both kinds of elements: \"When God gave birth to all things. He not only brought them into sight, but also brought into being things that had not existed before. Thus He was not merely an artificer, but also a Creator.\" Further, God joins in with the three other elements to create man— God contributes the soul. Even though this is the most important part, it is still only one part out of four. Thus from a theological point of view, it appears that this myth from Midrash ha-Ne'elam takes the point of view that God did have assistance in creating the world, but that God Himself first created those assistants, the elements, to serve that very purpose. This mitigates the pagan aspect of this myth.",

Others say that it rests on seven pillars, which stand on the water. This water is on top of the mountains, which rest on wind and storm. Still others say that the world stands on three pillars. Once every three hundred years they move slightly, causing earthquakes. But Rabbi Eleazar ben Shammua says that it rests on one pillar, whose name is \"Righteous.\" One of the ancient creation myths found in many cultures describes the earth as standing on one or more pillars. In this Jewish version of the myth, several theories are found — that the earth stands on twelve, seven, or three pillars — or on one. Rabbi Eleazar ben Shammua gives that one pillar the name of Tzaddik, \"Righteous,\" underscoring an allegorical reading of this myth, whereby God is the pillar that supports the world. This, of course, is the central premise of monotheism. Alternatively, his comment may be understood to refer to the Tzaddik, the righteous man whose existence is required for the world to continue to exist. Or it might refer to the principle of righteousness, and how the world could not exist without it.",

      "content": "The world has a foundation stone. This stone serves as the starting point for all that was created, and serves as a true foundation. How did it come to exist? In the beginning, when God desired to create the world. He took snow from beneath the Throne of Glory and cast it into the waters, where it congealed into a stone in the midst of the Deep. This is the center of the universe, and from it the earth expanded in all directions. God began the creation of His world at that foundation stone, and built the world upon it. Others say that God took a stone compounded of fire, water, and air, and cast it into the abyss so that it held fast there, holding back the waters of the deep, and the world was planted in that place. Then there are those who say that God took the Foundation Stone and hurled it to the place designated for the Temple, and raised His right foot and drove the stone down into the very bottom of the deep and made it the pillar of the earth and founded the world upon it. Still others say that God took an emerald stone engraved with mysteries of the alphabet, and threw it into the waters. It drifted from place to place until it came to the Holy Land, and there it sank, and the whole world was firmly established on it. And that is why it is called Even ha-Shetiyyah, the Foundation Stone. When King David decided to build the Temple in Jerusalem, he commanded that shafts be dug to a depth of fifteen hundred cubits. And lo, they struck a stone in one of those shafts. As soon as he learned of it. King David went there with Ahitophel, his counselor, and with other members of the court. They descended into the pit, and there, at the bottom, they saw the immense stone, shining like the darkest emerald. All those who saw it were amazed, and they knew that it must, indeed, be that fabled stone, which served as the world's foundation. Yet all at once King David was possessed by a great curiosity to see what lay beneath it. King David ordered it to be raised, but a voice came forth from the stone, saying: \"Be warned that I must not be lifted. I serve to hold back the waters of the Abyss.\"",

      "content": "God, in His omnipotence, created the entire universe simultaneously. He did so in a single utterance, without a single word preceding or following it, as it is said, God spoke all these words saying (Exod. 20:1). Heaven and earth and all that they contain were included in that utterance. There was nothing that came into existence earlier or later than anything else. However, the universe that God created with a single utterance lacked order. After having created the universe, God proceeded to put it in order. On the first day God separated light from darkness, as the first step in creating order. On the second day He established a division between different kinds of waters. Thus what occurred in the six days of Creation was merely the establishment of order in an existing universe. In this way were heaven and earth and everything therein created at the same instant. This commentary by Rabbi Hayim ben Attar (1696-1743), best known by the title of his commentary on the Torah, the Or ha-Hayim, is based on an interpretation of the verse for on it (the Sabbath) He rested from all His work which He had created in order to complete it (Gen. 2:2). Hayim ben Attar reads this verse as proof that the world had already been created — by a single utterance. There is also a tradition that God spoke the Ten Commandments in a single utterance (Mishnat Rabbi Eliezer).",

      "content": "When God created the world, He divided it into two parts: one part habitable and the other a desert, one on one side of the world and the other on the other side. Then he redivided the habitable part so that it formed a circle, the center of which is the Holy Land. And the center of the Holy Land is Jerusalem, and the center of Jerusalem is the Holy of Holies, where the Shekhinah dwells. The nourishment of all good things in the inhabited world flows from there, and there is nowhere that is not sustained by that source. God also divided the desert. That was the desert, the most terrible and sinister in the world, where the Israelites wandered for 40 long years. The Other Side — the side of evil — reigned in that desert. Had they been worthy, they might have broken its power for all time. But each time they provoked God to anger, the Other Side held sway, and they became subject to its power. Only after 40 years of wandering did the Israelites break the power of the Other Side and prevail. That is when they found their way back to the Holy Land.",
      "commentary": "This is both a creation myth and a kabbalistic allegory. As a creation myth, it describes a process of creation in which God first divided the world in halves, and later redivided the habitable part so that it formed a circle, which is where the Holy Land is located. In this it is also a myth about the creation of the Holy Land, and its location at the center of the world. Many medieval maps illustrated the Holy Land and Jerusalem as the navel of the world. For other myths about the creation of the Holy Land, see \"Myths of the Holy Land,\" pp. 401-429. At the same time, this is a kabbalistic allegory about the two sides of existence — the Side of Holiness, and the Sitra Ahra, the Other Side. All of existence is thus portrayed as being polar, with these opposing forces always active. The Shekhinah, for example, represents the Side of Holiness, whereas Lilith represents the Sitra Ahra .",

Chaos comes from a shadow known as darkness. Where did darkness come from? From something that existed before the world was created, since the very beginning of all existence. Thus chaos was projected from darkness, while darkness was created by the first thing that existed. Immortal beings were brought into being by that infinite source, every kind of divinity, and a likeness emanated from it, known as Wisdom, which took the form of the primordial light. In this way Wisdom serves as a veil, separating mankind from the world above.",
      "commentary": "This is a key Gnostic myth from On the Origin of the World , one of the Nag Hammadi texts, which is dominated by Jewish influences. In many respects, it is a commentary on the creation story in Genesis. The Gnostic reading of Genesis tries to probe the origin of tohu (chaos) and vohu (void) in Genesis 1:2: Now the earth was unformed and void . (\"Unformed\" is a translation of tohu.) The Gnostic interpretation also draws on the concept of darkness in the next part of the verse, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. Here \"darkness\" is understood as having existed before chaos, and darkness itself is brought into being by an unnamed infinite force. This shows a form of creation by emanation, which is also the basis of the later kabbalistic system of emanation known as the ten sefirot. In the Gnostic myth, the infinite force brings darkness into being, which, in turn, leads to the emanation of chaos. The Gnostic myth also goes a step further, describing a concurrent or synonymous creation of immortal beings, as well as the creation of Wisdom, personified here as a likeness emanated from the infinite force. Wisdom — Sophia in Greek — is a key mythic figure in Gnostic texts, a role far exceeding the development found in Jewish texts. See \"The Creation of Wisdom,\" p. 45. Note the linkage of Sophia (Wisdom personified) and the primordial light, created on the first day, when God said, \"Let there he light\" Some Jewish sources also identify",

      "content": "On the day of his creation, when Adam saw the sun set for the first time, he said to Eve, \"Because we have sinned, the world around us is growing dark. Soon the universe will become void and without form, as it was before God brought it into being. This must mean that we have been sentenced to death.\" So Adam and Eve stayed up all night weeping and fasting. But when the sun rose at dawn, Adam was greatly relieved and said, \"There must be a course that the sun follows.\" After that, Adam put on priestly garments and offered a bullock as a sacrifice, out of gratitude that their lives had been spared. And when Adam died those garments were inherited by Seth. There are a number of variants of this myth. In some, Adam first experiences darkness on the day of his creation; in others, after the end of the Sabbath. His response is the universal fear of darkness, but in some versions it is because Adam is afraid they have been condemned to death because of their sin, and that God is uncreating the world, while in other sources he is afraid that the serpent will now be able to bite him. See the following myth, \"The Origin of Fire,\" for an example of the latter myth. In the Bible, Moses' brother Aaron is identified as the first High Priest. But here Adam performs the role and passes the priestly garments on to his son, Seth. This is a variant on the myth of the handing down of the garments of Adam and Eve mentioned in Genesis 3:21: And the Lord God made garments of skins for Adam and his wife , and clothed them .

He cried out to God that the serpent was coming to harm him. Then God told Adam to take two flints and to strike them against each other. And when he did, fire came forth, much to Adam's amazement, and he uttered a spontaneous blessing over it. That is why a blessing is recited over a candle at the end of the Sabbath, for fire was then created for the first time. Myths of origin are common in all mythic systems, including Judaism. Myths of the creation of the world, of the origin of man, and here, of the origin of fire, are all found in Jewish sources. Here God tells Adam how to make a fire, rubbing flints together. This first fire is tied to the darkness that descends after the sun sets at the end of the Sabbath. Thus a series of origins are all linked together: the first Sabbath, the first sunset, the first darkness, the origin of fire — and the origin of the first blessing for the first Havdalah service, which takes place at the end of the Sabbath. See \"Adam Brings Down Fire from Heaven,\" p. 137. B. Pesahim 54a suggests that rather than God directing Adam to rub the flints together, God inspired Adam with divine intuition, so that Adam knew on his own what he needed to do.

      "content": "Long ago, primeval waters covered the whole world. There were waters upon waters. Still, God poured more waters into them, even after they were full — He pressed down upon them and made them gather into one great sea, known as Okeanos. The great sea stands on the fins of Leviathan, and Leviathan dwells in the Lower Waters, and appears in them as but a small fish in the sea. And the Lower Waters stand on the shore of the Waters of Ocean, and appear as but a small well there. And the Waters of Ocean stand on the shore of the Waters of Creation. And the Waters of Creation stand on the shore of the Weeping Waters. And the Weeping Waters stand on the shore of the Abyss. And the Abyss stands on tohu, chaos, and tohu stands on vohu, void. And all of this is suspended from the arm of God. The Okeanos Sea is said to surround the whole earth. There is a place in it called the Place of Swallowing where the waters swallow all the other waters that flow there. While on a voyage. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua happened upon this place, and took a barrel full of water from there. When Caesar asked them about the nature of the waters of Okeanos, they gave him a jug of this water, and they poured many barrels of water into that jug and it never overflowed, but swallowed all the waters poured into it. This explains why all the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full (Eccles. 1:7).",
      "commentary": "So too are the candles of the sun extinguished in the waters of Okeanos so that there is no light during the night, and the flames of the sun are not relit until the sun comes to the East and bathes in a River of Fire, called Nehar di-Nur. Once a month the clouds come down to drink of the waters of Okeanos. Once it happened that the clouds swallowed, together with the water, a ship full of com, and after that com fell from the heavens mixed with rain. The idea of waters that encompass the earth is found in many of the world's myths. Okeanos, the name given to the Great Sea, is taken from the Greek god Okeanos, originally a river god, later the god of the sea. Okeanos was the offspring of Ouranos (Sky) and Gaia (Earth), and thus of the race of Titans that included Kronos, the father of Zeus. The Great Sea of Jewish mythology is really the Mediterranean, but it has been given mythic characteristics, such as standing on the fins of Leviathan. There are also mythic places within the ocean, such as the Place of Swallowing. So too is it the place where all the candles of the sun are extinguished, and miraculous events can take place, such as corn raining from the sky. These are the Jewish equivalents of Greek myths such as the Isle of the Blessed, in the waters of Okeanos, where the souls of heroes dwelled. For other Jewish myths of the ocean, see \"The Rebellion of the Waters,\" p. 105 and \"The Rebellion of Rahab,\" p. 106. For a variant myth, see \"A Universe of Water,\" p. 94.",

      "content": "The upper waters are masculine and the lower, feminine. At first the upper waters and the lower waters were commingled, until God said , \" Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters \" (Gen. 1:6). But the upper waters and the lower waters refused to separate, clinging to each other. Some say that God raised His little finger and tore the waters into two parts, and forced half of them below. Others say that fire came forth that divided them, and in this way the upper waters were separated from the lower with great weeping. So it is that the upper waters remain suspended by Divine command, and their fruit is the rain water. The firmament in which the sun, moon, the stars, and the planets are suspended is the great meeting place where the upper waters are gathered, and from which the earth is watered. And when the rain is ready to fall, the upper waters say to the lower: \"Receive me,\" and immediately they receive them, as a female receives a male. Thus the earth is fed from above, and all living things flourish here below. If the firmament dividing the waters from the waters were ever removed, even for an instant, the world would revert to utter chaos. It would be as if it had never existed at all, and things would be exactly as they were before God said, \" Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters . \" The sky is the firmament that separates the waters above, which fall as rain, from the waters below, which rise up as springs. The midrashic interpretations of the upper waters and the lower waters all center on their identification as masculine and feminine, so powerfully drawn to each other that they resisted God's command to separate. While drawing on this midrashic reading, the Zohar also identifies the upper waters as Elohim and the lower as Yahweh, a Gnostic reading of the role of God's two primary names ( Zohar 1:17b). The Zohar also identifies the upper waters as the sefirah Hesed (Lovingkindness) and the lower with the sefirah Gevurah (Power). The fire that separated the upper and lower waters is linked in the Zohar with the fire of Gehenna, providing this as the origin of that fire. The Zohar (1:18a) points out the importance of diversity in the world, noting that \"as long as the upper and lower waters were commingled, there was no production in the world. This could only take place when they were separated and became distinct.\"",

      "title": "The Rebellion Of The Waters",
      "content": "On the second day of Creation, God tore the upper waters from the arms of the lower waters amidst great weeping, and the upper waters were suspended in the heavens by the word of God. On the third day, when God said, \"Let the waters be gathered together \" (Gen 1:9), the mountains and hills were raised up and scattered, and deep valleys were dug in the earth, into which the waters rolled. As soon as they had gathered together, the waters became rebellious, rising up almost to the Throne of Glory, and covered the face of the earth. But God rebuked the waters and said \"Enough!\" and subdued them beneath the soles of His feet. He trod down on them so that the air came out of them. When the rest of the waters saw how He had trampled the ocean, and heard its terrible cry, they fled. Even though they were seething, there was nowhere for them to go but to the sea. Therefore God surrounded the sea with sand, and measured it with the hollow of His hand, and made the sea swear that it would not go beyond the boundary He had set, as it is said. Who set the sand as a boundary to the sea (Jer. 5:22). Some say that God not only circled the sea with sand, but caused it to dry up, in accord with the verse He rebukes the sea and dries it up (Nah. 1:4). This midrash draws a link between God's separation of the upper and lower waters on the second day (see \"The Upper Waters and the Lower Waters,\" p. 104) and the gathering of the waters on the third, suggesting that the waters rebelled because of thenanger at their recent separation. This midrash also comments on Psalm 93:3: The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice, the floods lift up their roaring. God's quelling the rebellion of the waters clearly echoes the struggle between Marduk, the rain god of Babylon, and Tiamat, the personification of primeval waters in the Babylonian epic, Enuma Elish. This epic struggle (also found in other Near Eastern texts) is hinted at in the Genesis creation narrative, where tehom, the deep, echoes Tiamat. The parallels to the Babylonian myth can be seen in the following passage from Enuma Elish , from Near Eastern Mythology by John Gray, 1969, p. 32: The Lord trod on the legs of Tiamat With his unsparing mace he crushed her skull. When the arteries of her blood he had severed. He split her like a shell-fish into two parts; Half of her he set up and sealed it as sky. Pulled down the bar and posted guards. He bade them not to allow her waters to escape. Exodus Rabbah 15:22 makes clear that the ocean was not only trampled by God, but slain: \"Then God trampled upon the ocean and slew it.\" This text is sometimes interpreted to mean that God slew its prince, Rahab. The reference to the hollow of God's hand comes from Isaiah 60:12. See the following myth, \"The Rebellion of Rahab.\" In Likutei Moharan 1:2, Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav interprets God's command of \"Enough!\" to stop the expansion of the world as referring to the creation of the Sabbath. The Sabbath, in effect, stops the work of the six days of the week.",

      "content": "When God desired to create the world. He said to Rahab, the angel of the sea: \"Open your mouth and swallow all the waters of the world.\" Rahab replied: \"Master of the Universe, I already have enough.\" God then kicked Rahab with His foot and killed him. And had not the waters covered him, no creature could have stood his foul odor. The traditions about God slaying Rahab grows out of Isaiah 51:9, Are you not he who cut Rahab in pieces , and wounded the dragon? and Psalms 89:10, You have trampled upon Rahab; you have scattered your enemies with your strong arm . This midrash is also based on Job 26:12: By His power He stilled the sea; by His skill He struck down Rahab . This myth is another version of \"The Rebellion of the Waters,\" which describes the struggle between God and tehom , the deep, and thus also echoes the battle between Marduk and Tiamat in the Babylonian epic, Enuma Elish. However, Tiamat is a feminine figure,",
      "commentary": "while Rahab is masculine. In Enuma Elish Marduk uses Tiamat's body to build a new world, using half to make the heavens and half to make the earth. He uses considerable violence in defeating Tiamat, as does God in defeating Rahab. Marduk crushes her skull with his club, splits her body in two, and scatters her blood in the wind. In the Hebrew myth, the waters are personified in Rahab, the Prince of the Sea, and instead of trampling the waters, God kicks and kills Rahab. There are hints in rabbinic writings that Rahab once had a great, godlike status. For example, it is stated in Deuteronomy Rabbah 2:28: \"Rahab placed God in heaven and upon earth.\" Although Rahab is killed in this myth, he reappears in later legends as the Prince of the Sea, and performs various deeds at the command of God or one of the rabbis. See, for example, Y. Sanhedrin 7:23d, where Rabbi Joshua ben Haninah calls upon Rahab to recover a lost charm, so that a spell can be broken.",

      "content": "When God decided to create the world. He addressed the Prince of Darkness, saying, \"Get you hence. It is My intention to begin Creation with light.\" But the Prince of Darkness, who was black as a bull, was afraid that if the darkness were lit, he would become God's slave. So the Prince feigned deafness, and ignored God's rebuke, saying, \"Why not create the world from darkness?\" \"Get you hence at once,\" God replied, \"before you perish from the world!\" \"And after light what will You create?\" asked the Prince of Darkness. God replied, \"Darkness.\" So it was. But it is said that in End of Days the Prince of Darkness will declare himself equal to God, and claim to have taken part in Creation, saying, \"Although God made heaven and light, it was I who made darkness and the pit of hell!\" His angels will support his claim, but the fires of hell will quench their arrogance. The identity of the Prince of Darkness is blurred in rabbinic texts. In this case, the Prince of Darkness is primarily a mythic personification of elemental darkness. At the same time, the rebellion of the Prince of Darkness is linked to the rebellions of the angels Satan (sometimes called Samael), and Lucifer. The identity of all of these angels, including the Prince of Darkness, blurs together in Jewish tradition. See \"The Fall of Lucifer,\" p. 108. After God's rebuke, other princes in heaven proclaim the Prince of Darkness to be their king, and he rewards them by bestowing pavilions on them, as in the passage. He made pavilions of darkness about him (2 Sam. 22:12). But God then rebukes them for their rebelliousness and disperses them. Following the creation of light and darkness, the myth goes on to describe the creation of the signs of the zodiac, linking rabbinic lore with the astrological.",

      "number": 141,
      "title": "The Fall Of Lucifer",
      "content": "At first Lucifer, the highest archangel, was the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and flawless in beauty. He resided on God's holy mountain; he walked among stones of fire. He was blameless in his ways until he was filled with lawlessness and sinned. For he said, \"I will climb to the sky; higher than the stars of God will I set my throne.\" Then, on the second day of Creation, Lucifer, together with his legions of angels, attempted to set himself up as the equal of God. Then God hurled him from the heights, together with his angels, and cast them into a bottomless abyss. The myth of the fall of Lucifer finds its origin in the ancient Canaanite myth of Athtar, who attempted to rule the throne of Ba'al, but was forced to descend and rule the underworld instead. In Jewish sources, this myth only exists in fragmentary form, primarily in Isaiah 14:12 and 2 Enoch. The myth of Lucifer's fall plays a surprisingly minor role in Jewish mythology, perhaps because of the prominence it gained in Christianity. Here, because of the statement by Jesus, I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven (Luke 18:10), Lucifer became identified with Satan, even though they are two entirely separate mythic figures. (It is interesting to note that in some recensions of 2 Enoch , Lucifer is identified with the angel Satanel.) From this point on, Lucifer and Satan become synonymous with the Devil in Christian lore, while the myth of Lucifer is essentially lost from Jewish tradition. Yet there is a clear distinction between Satan, the Tempter and heavenly prosecutor, who often cooperates with God, and with Lucifer, who was cast out after rebelling. The fall of Lucifer also strongly echoes the account in Genesis 6 of the descent of the Sons of God to earth from heaven. Once the myth of Lucifer was ceded to the Christians, the primary sources for the myth remained those in the Bible and Pseudepigrapha, and the myth ceased to be developed in the midrash. Indeed, it is necessary to reconstruct it from the existing fragments, not only in Isaiah and 2 Enoch, but also from Ezekiel 28:11-19, where Lucifer is not directly named, but reference to his myth seems apparent. The name Lucifer also refers to the planet Venus, the morning star, which first appears to dominate the heavens, but then disappears. This too parallels the pattern of the fall of Lucifer. Isaiah recounts the myth: How are you fallen from heaven, O Shining One, son of Dawn! How are you felled to earth, 0 vanquisher of nations! Once you thought in your heart, 1 will climb to the sky; Higher than the stars of God I will set my throne. I will sit in the mount of the assembly. On the summit of Zaphon: I will mount the back of a cloud — I will match the Most High. Instead, you are brought down to Sheol, to the bottom of the pit. Isaiah 14:12-13 The account of Lucifer being cast out of heaven is also found in 2 Enoch 29, 4-5, where God Himself is the speaker, describes how Lucifer tried to overthrow Him and was cast out of heaven: \"I hurled him out of the heights, together with his angels.\" By setting the myth on the second day of Creation, it is clear that the rebellion takes place strictly in heaven, without any consideration of human beings, who were yet to be created. The missing details of the fall of Lucifer appear to be found in Ezekiel 28:11, although Lucifer is not directly named. Indeed, the passage seems to allude to the myth by means of allegory, in that it is addressed to the King of Tyre, who is about to experience a great fall.",

      "title": "Satan Cast From Heaven",
      "content": "On the day that Adam was created, Satan went forth in heaven and flew like a bird in the air. God breathed His spirit into Adam, and Adam received the likeness of His image, as it is said. Let us make man in our image , after our likeness (Gen. 1:26). God summoned the angel Michael and said, \"Behold — I have made Adam in the likeness of My image.\" So Michael summoned all the angels, and God said to them, \"Come, bow down to the god I have made.\" Michael bowed down first. Then he called upon Satan and said, \"You too bow down to Adam.\" Satan said, \"I will not bow down to anyone created after me. It is not proper for me to bow down to Adam.\" And the other angels who were with him also refused to bow down to Adam. Then God became angry with Satan and cast him and all the angels who had followed him from heaven to the earth. So too did God announce that He would establish Adam's dominion on the throne of Satan, while Satan would be cast down so that Adam might sit above him. When Satan realized all that he had lost, he decided to avenge himself against Adam, who was living in the Garden of Eden. He carefully prepared a trap for Adam so that he, too, would be deprived of his happiness, just as Satan had been. And that is why Satan sought revenge against Adam and convinced Eve to taste the forbidden fruit. This myth is a variant of the \"The Fall of Lucifer,\" p. 108. Here the evil angel is identified as Satan instead of Lucifer, and the rebellion was not planned in advance, but grows out of Satan's indignation at being asked to bow down to the newly created Adam, who is identified to the angels as a god: \"Come, bow down to the god I have made.\" Satan's refusal to do so provokes God into casting him and all his followers to earth— not to hell. God's identification of Satan with sinners is confirmed in Targum to Job 27:7: \"Let my enemy be like the sinner, and the one rising up against me like the wicked.\" In the present myth Satan's rebellion follows the creation of Adam, which took place on the sixth day of Creation, rather than at the beginning of Creation, as in the fall of Lucifer. Thus, in \"The Fall of Lucifer,\" Lucifer rebels directly against God simply to usurp God's power, out of his jealousy over God, while here Satan's rebellion is brought about by God's creation of Adam. This is stated explicitly in the Targum to Job 31, in which Satan wanted to create another world, where he would have dominion, because all things were subservient to Adam on earth.",
      "commentary": "This myth of Satan being cast out of heaven is also found in Christian sources, prominently in the Book of Revelation: And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan , who deceives the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him (Rev. 12:9). Although Satan does not appear in the biblical account of the Fall, the identification of Satan with the serpent brought Satan to the forefront of this myth. See \"How Cain was Conceived,\" p. 447, where Satan, riding the serpent, has intercourse with Eve, from which Cain is conceived. Thus the serpent fulfills its phallic role in the exegetic fantasies of the rabbis. A Muslim version of the myth of Satan (identified as Iblis) refusing to bow down before Adam is found in the Koran 7:11. God s identification of Adam as a god strongly echoes the basic Gnostic assumptions about a Creator God and a demiurge. Here, although the role of the demiurgic Adam is unclear, we can recall the extensive traditions about the primordial Adam. See \"Adam the Golem,\" p. 127, \"Adam the Hermaphrodite,\" p. 138, and \"Adam the Giant,\" p. 128.",

      "title": "The Quarrel Of The Sun And The Moon",
      "content": "In the beginning there was no difference between the two great lights of the sun or moon. They were both created to light the earth, and for signs and for seasons, and they were equal in all respects: in their height, shape, and in the amount of light they each cast. But no sooner were they created, than they began to quarrel. Each said to the other: \"I am bigger than you are.\" At last the moon complained to God that the heavens and earth could not have two luminaries of equal size, saying, \"Master of the Universe, is it possible for two kings to wear one crown?\" God replied: \"Go then and make yourself smaller.\" \"In that case,\" said the moon, \"what will then be the light of the sun?\" God replied, \"The sun's li ght will grow sevenfold!\" \"Master of the universe,\" cried the moon, \"do I deserve such a fate?\" Fear not, said God, \"for Israel shall reckon the days and the years by you, and one day you will be restored to your original state.\" Still the moon obstinately refused to become smaller. Then God rebuked the moon and she fell from her high estate, and sparks fell from her over the whole sky, creating stars that diminished her light. Thus the rebellion of the moon brought about its decrease, while the rule of the sun was increased, as it is said, the greater light to dominate the day, the lesser light to dominate the night, and the stars (Gen. 1:16). However, in the time to come, the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall become sevenfold, like the light of the seven days (Isa. 30:26). The notion that the sun and moon were once equal is derived from the biblical verse God made the two great lights (Gen. 1:16). This sun and moon myth is a commentary on the passage. The greater light to dominate the day and the lesser light to dominate the night (Gen. 1:16). It not only explains how the moon lost its light and was made smaller, but also provides the origin of the stars from the former light of the moon. Rashi and Rabbi Judah Loew (1525-1609) of Prague interpret the creation of the stars as an attempt to appease the moon. This notion is confirmed by Genesis Rabbah 6:4: \"Since the moon diminished itself to rule only at night, God decreed that when it appears, the stars shall accompany it. Others say that the moon was diminished because it intruded into the sphere of the sun, sometimes being visible during the day.\" The final quote from Isaiah 30:26 can also be seen as a rare example of a biblical midrash, identifying the light of the seven days of Creation with the primordial light, by stating that the light of the first day was seven times as powerful as the light of the sun. See \"The Light of the First Day,\" p. 83. In the allegorical reading of this myth, the sun represents the Gentiles and the moon, the Jews.

Thus the sun halted in midheaven, and did not press on to set for a whole day, for the Lord fought for Israel. Neither before nor since has there ever been such a day, when the Lord acted on words spoken by a man. After the parting of the Red Sea, the most famous miraculous event in the Bible is the sun standing still in the sky in Joshua 10:12-14. Both of these examples demonstrate that God can overrule the powers of nature at His command, and, of course, both examples served to benefit Israel.",

      "content": "Once upon a time, the moon came to the sun with a complaint: the sun was able to shine during the warmth of day, especially during the summer, while the moon could shine only during the cool of night. The sun saw that the moon was unhappy with her lot, particularly in the wintertime, so he told the moon he would have a garment sewn for her, to keep her warm. Then the sun called upon all the great tailors to make a garment for the moon. The simple tailors also wanted to help, but they weren't invited so they didn't go. After discussing the matter for some time, the great tailors came to the conclusion that it was simply impossible to sew a garment that would fit, because the moon is sometimes little and sometimes big. What measurements were they to use? Now when the little tailors heard this, they said, \"If the big tailors won't do it, we will.\" But the big tailors scoffed when they heard this and said, \"If we can't do it, how could you?\"",
      "commentary": "This is a fragmentary tale told by Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav. Nachman not only told the famous 13 stories in Sippurei Ma’asiyot, but he told several dozen brief tales, including some unfinished tales. \"A Garment for the Moon\" is one of these. It follows the midrashic tradition about the sun and the moon, especially the tale of \"The Quarrel of the Sun and Moon.\" (See p. 112.) The tale ends with the offer of the poor tailors to help the great tailors in sewing a garment for the moon, which the great tailors refuse. Such fragmentary and incomplete tales were often told by Rabbi Nachman and were dutifully recorded by his scribe. Rabbi Nathan of Nemirov. The fact that the big tailors have the last word here is a clear indication that the tale was unfinished, as Rabbi Nachman's sympathies in such cases were always with the \"little\" people. In fact, a passage from Genesis Rabbah (6:3) strongly suggests the identification of the poor tailors with the Jews: \"Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Jose ben Lai: 'It is but natural that the great should count by the great, and the small by the small. Esau counts time by the sun, which is large, and Jacob by the moon, which is small.'\" The discussion is continued by a sage whose name also happens to be Rabbi Nachman: \"Said Rabbi Nachman: That is a happy augury. Esau counts by the sun, which is large: just as the sun rules by day but not by night, so does Esau enjoy this world, but has naught in the World to Come. Jacob counts by the moon, which is small: just as the moon rules by day and by night, so has Jacob a portion in this world and the World to Come.'\" The present dependent condition of the moon on the sun echoes a talmudic myth (B. Hullin 60b) about competition between the sun and the moon, which is a commentary on the passage. And God made the two great lights (Gen. 1:16): \"The moon said to the Holy One, blessed be He, 'Master of the Universe, is it possible for two kings to wear one crown?' God replied: 'Go then and make yourself smaller.'\" Thus the rebellion of the moon brought about its decrease. This talmudic legend is echoed in a dialogue, closely resembling that in Rabbi Nachman's tale, found in Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 6: \"Rivalry ensued between the sun and the moon, and one said to the other, 'I am bigger than you are.' The other rejoined, 'I am bigger than you are.' What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do, so that there should be peace between them? He made the one larger and the other smaller, as it is said. The greater light to rule by the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, and the stars\" (Genesis 1:16). It seems certain that Rabbi Nachman had these rabbinic myths in mind when he told his enticing, fragmentary tale. It is also possible to read this tale as an allegory in which Israel is the moon, God is the sun, and the garment is the Torah, which protects Israel against the winters of Exile. See \"A Garment for the Moon\" in Miriam's Tambourine, pp. 287-294, which attempts to complete this fragmentary tale.",

      "content": "Did God have the assistance of the angels in the creation of the world? Most say that God created the world by Himself, and not by means of an angel and not by means of a messenger. But some say that God commanded the angels, and they obeyed Him. In this way the heavens were created with the light of the angels, and some say it was even the angels who stretched out the heavens, Gabriel in the north and Michael in the south. Others say that when God created the world. He created all things in the form of angels, for they are the foundation of all created things. The angels were emanated from the splendor of His glorious light. Then the heavens were created upon this foundation of angels. Those who say that God worked alone insist that none of the angels were created on the first day. But those who claim that the angels assisted God say that every kind of angel was created on the first day, and that God had a partner in His work of Creation. For just as by the word of Yahweh the heavens were made, so too were all the hosts of angels made by the breath of His mouth (Ps. 33:6). And since breath comes before speech, it can be concluded that the angels were created first. Not so, say the others. In this case, God reversed the usual order of breath and word by creating with the word although no breath had as yet emanated from His mouth. Thus the heavens were created first, and the angels followed. On this, however, all agree: once the world was created, the angels came to play an important role. Each day, before the sun rises, the angels lead the sun through a heavenly stream, to cool it off and prevent it from scorching the earth. Then the angels guide the sun in its journey. The angels also serve as messengers of God. When they are sent to this world to carry out a mission, they become clothed in a body formed from air or fire. When they are sent by God s word, they become winds, as it is said. He made His angels winds (Ps. 104:4), but when they serve God as ministers, they are made of fire. Thus they appear in human form, but as soon as they complete their duties, they divest themselves of their bodies and return to their spiritual state.",
      "commentary": "So too does an angel serve as the prince over each of the elements. Gabriel is the Prince of Fire, Rahab the Prince of the Sea, Ridya the Prince of Rain, and Michael the Prince of Hail. There are also four angels that surround God's throne, the archangels Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, and Raphael. That is why it is said in the prayers recited before sleeping, \"May Michael be at my right hand, Gabriel at my left, before me Uriel, behind me Raphael' and above my head the Divine Presence of God.\" There are differing accounts as to when the angels were created, and these differences are directly related to the question of whether or not the angels participated in the creation of the world. The Book of Jubilees places the creation of the angels on the first day of Creation. Other sources, such as Targum Pseudo-Yonathan on Genesis 1:26, Midrash Konen and Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 4, put the creation of the angels on the second day. Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer says, \"As for the angels created on the second day, when they are sent as messengers, they are changed into winds, and when they minister before God, they are changed into fire.\" Targum Pseudo-Yonathan says, \"And God said to the angels who minister before him, who were created on the second day of the creation of the world, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness\"’ (Gen. 1:26). Genesis Rabbah 1:3 places the creation of the angels on the fifth day. The rejection of the notion that the angels participated in Creation derives from around the third century. The day on which the angels were created thus becomes of crucial importance. If on the first day, as in 77k Book of Jubilees, which dates from the first century, it suggests that the angels were available to assist God. But this was seen to raise questions about the singularity of God's role, and therefore most later texts describe the creation of the angels as taking place on either the second or the fifth day of Creation.",

When the other angels see him they remove the crown of glory from their heads and fall on their faces. His glory and radiance cover the chambers of the upper heaven, as it is said. His majesty covers the skies , His splendor fills the earth (Hab. 3:3). Some say that he is the creator of the beginning, while others say that he is the creator of the world. It is he who possesses the secrets of heaven. It was the angel Anafiel whom God sent to bring Enoch into heaven, where he was transformed into the angel Metatron. So too was it Anafiel who was sent to strike Metatron with sixty fiery lashes when he did not rise from his throne when Elisha ben Abuyah approached him during his ascent on high. * The angel Anafiel is a highly exalted figure, an archangel, who is said to have helped God in the Creation, and is known as the Creator of the Beginning. He is also described as one of the gatekeepers of the seventh palace. His official name is Anafiel YHVH, as the high archangels carry YHVH, the Tetragrammaton, as part of their names. The fact that Anafiel is described as being superior to Metatron — and, in some versions, that it was Anafiel who delivered the punishment of sixty fiery lashes to Metatron— emphasizes his importance and indicates that Anafiel was originally regarded as a supreme being who took part in the creation of the world. However, the role of Anafiel receded as that of Metatron was elevated, and today the only evidence of Anafiel's supreme role in the heavenly hierarchy is found in isolated fragments of die Hekhalot and Merkavah literature.",

The Primordial Man is usually identified as Adam Kadmon. See \"Adam Kadmon,\" p. 15. It is not clear whether or not Yotzer Bereshit should be identified as an independent divine figure, a kind of demiurge, or simply as another of God's names, as appears to be the case in the Aleinu prayer: \"It is our duty to praise the Lord of all things, to ascribe greatness to Him who formed the world in the beginning.\" The ambiguity about the identity of this mysterious figure suggests his role as a demiurge, as rabbinic and kabbalistic literature is full of hints that the divine figure who created the world had some kind of independent existence from the unknown aspect of God known in kabbalah as Ein Sof. The Primordial Man is understood both as a transitional phase of Creation and as the first created being, and as such is a Jewish version of the Gnostic myth of the Creator God and the demiurge.",

      "content": "There are those who say that God, the First Creator, created only a single angel. God appointed this angel as His proxy. And this angel, in turn, created the whole world. He created all things perfect and complete in the first moments of Creation, including Adam and Eve and the other living beings, as well as the plants and trees. So too did he create the sun and the moon and the stars according to the utmost degree of their possible perfection. He arranged the stars in the sky, giving to each its proper place and creating their beauty. Thus the world was created perfect and whole. God spoke to the prophets through this angel, and it is this angel who performed miracles and through whom the Law was revealed to Moses. Indeed, it is this angel who brings about everything that happens in the world. Others say that God selected a certain angel from all those who attend upon Him, to confer His name upon him, and to proclaim this angel as His apostle, whose place in the world was God's place, and whose word was God's word. That angel is the elect one of the world. This strongly Gnostic myth was held by the Magharians (\"cave dwellers\"), a Jewish sect who lived at the time of the Sadducees, before the rise of Christianity. They were known as \"cave dwellers\" because their books were found in a cave. They felt the Sadducees had anthropomorphized the Creator, and objected to this approach to scriptural interpretation. Their strong belief was that God cannot be compared to any created being, and that all statements to this effect in the Torah refer to an angel. According to the Magharians, it is this angel who is spoken of as God in the Bible. Yet",
      "commentary": "while the parallels of the belief of the Magharians to Gnostic views is apparent, there are also differences. The demiurge in Gnosticism is not God's agent, but is usually described as an evil being who is in opposition to the good God. But the theology of the Magharians is consistent with other Gnostic systems with conspicuous Jewish elements, where the demiurgic role is usually played by an angel or an elevated human, such as Adam. The Magharians also teach that God spoke to the prophets through this pre-existent angel. This implies that the angel is in some ways working God's will. The Magharians felt it was quite natural for God to send a messenger and give him His Name and say, \"This is My messenger, and his position among you is My position, and his word and command My word and command, and his appearance My appearance.\" This, the primary myth of the Magharians, grew out of their distress at the use of anthropomorphic expressions for God in the Bible. They objected to biblical phrases such as God came, God ascended into the clouds,\" \"He has written the Torah with His hand,\" \"He sits on His throne,\" \"He has curly hair and black hair on His head,\" or \"the Mighty One laughed.\" They strongly believed that God could and must not be portrayed in anthropomorphic terms. But rather than deny that God could be portrayed in such terms, their solution was to identify the God of the Bible as an angel created by the First Creator. It was this angel who, in turn, created the world. Some of the most anthropomorphic passages about God occur in the Exodus narrative, such as Yahweh is a man of war (Exod. 15:3), Yahweh came down upon Mount Sinai, to the top of the mount (Exod. 19:20), and Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and they saw the God of Israel ; and there was under His feet the likeness of a pavement of sapphire stone (Exod. 24:9-10). This portrayal of God is attributed by the Magharians to the pre-existent angel. The notion that God revealed the Law through an angel is found in The Book of Jubilees 1 :27 as well: \"And God said to the angel of the presence: 'Write for Moses from the beginning of Creation till My sanctuary has been built among them for all eternity.\"' The angel of the Magharians is also identified with the Angel of the Lord, especially as identified in the key passage from Exodus 23:20-21: \"/ am sending an angel before you to guard you on the way and to bring you to the place that I have made ready. Pay heed to him, and obey him. Do not defy him, for he will not pardon your offenses, since My Name is in him.\" Although the angel myth of the Magharians originated out of reverence to God and their belief that God must not be portrayed in anthropomorphic terms, in the end they reduced the importance of God and raised up the importance of the angel, who was the true creator of this world. Philo's concept of the Logos, or some parallel traditions, which at times becomes identified as an angel, may have influenced the Magharian myth. This mythic solution later induced this sect to become Christian, in that they accepted the idea that the creating angel had human form, and therefore could take the form of a human being. The founder of the sect, however, returned to Judaism, disillusioned by Christianity, and wrote two books attacking it. There are also reports about the Magharians in Shahrastani, where their name was corrupted into Makaribans. Here the angel is not pre-existent, but one of the ministering angels who is selected by God as his proxy. Otherwise the myths are the same.",

God planted this tree for the whole world, and everything that God created afterward emerged from this tree. All souls blossom from it, flying forth in joy. All things emanate from it. The whole world delights in it. Everything needs it and yearns for it, and seeks to glimpse that tree. And, at the end of their lives, the souls of the righteous ascend on high, attaching themselves to this tree. God was alone when He created the cosmic tree and sowed the seeds of All. None was with Him when he planted and rooted that tree, and there was none to whom He could confide this secret. That is why no angel can raise himself above it to say: \"I was there first/' The cosmic tree described here functions both as a myth and as an allegory. This dual nature is commonly found in kabbalah, in which there is an ongoing dialectic between myth and allegory. The myth of a tree that is also the cosmos has astrological roots, while its allegorical aspect is the symbolic Tree of Life that is used to represent the sefirot, especially the final seven sefirot. The names of these sefirot are identified in the verse Yours, Lord, are the Greatness, the Strength, the Beauty, the Victory and the Splendor, for All in heaven and earth. Yours O God is the Kingdom (I Chron. 29:11). The sefirah Yesod, representing the sexual organ in man, is identified as the \"All\" that is the source of all souls, for through Yesod souls are transmitted. Sefer ha-Bahir discusses the cosmic tree in two passages, 22 and 119. In the latter the cosmic tree is defined: \"What is this tree? The powers of God, one above the other, resembling a tree.\" Here too the metaphor of the tree is expanded, as follows: \"lust as a tree brings forth fruit through water, God increases the power of the tree through water. What is the water of God? It is wisdom. It is the souls of the righteous. The Shekhinah dwells among them. Their deeds rest in the bosom of God, and He makes them fruitful and multiplies them.\" In Isaiah 44:24 God says, \"It is I, Yahweh, who made everything, who stretched out the heavens alone and spread out the earth.\" This statement is intended to eliminate speculation that other forces, such as the angels, aided in Creation. Likewise, Genesis Rabbah 1:3 states, \"When were the angels created? All agree that none were created on the first day, lest you should say, Michael stretched the world in the south and Gabriel in the north, while God measured it in the middle.\" (Other sources, however, link the creation of the angels to the first day of Creation, and imply that the angels did participate in the subsequent creation. See \"Creation By Angels,\" p. 116 and the accompanying note.) This sentiment is also found in this passage from Sefer ha-Bahir 22:11, where God takes complete credit for having created the cosmic tree, which is a metaphor for the universe. This tree is the origin of the souls of the world. It does not seem to be identical to the Tree of Life, although life emerges from it.",

      "content": "At the time of Creation, God created worlds and destroyed them. The worlds that were created and those that were destroyed were the shattered vessels that God had sent forth. Out of those broken vessels God created the present universe. Here Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira transforms Rabbi Isaac Luria's myth of the Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks, linking the Ari's myth to the midrash found in Genesis Rabbah 3:7 and elsewhere about God having destroyed many previous worlds prior to the creation of this one. In the midrash, God destroys the worlds because they don't please him — in some way they are imperfect. But here Rabbi Shapira has brilliantly transformed a myth about destruction into a myth about creation. Instead of the prior worlds simply having been destroyed, here they are understood to have been the basis for the subsequent, present universe, known as olam ha-tikkun, world of repair. Although Rabbi Shapira 's reinterpretation of the Ari's myth is really a new myth in itself, it does not contradict the Ari's myth, where the Shattering of the Vessels, and the spilling of the primordial light inside them serves as the prelude to the Gathering of the Sparks, which is precisely tikkun olam— repair of the world. Thus the end result of the two versions is the same. From this perspective. Rabbi Shapira's myth might be seen as an alternate version of the Ari's myth, to which, of course, it directly refers. See \"The Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks,\" p. 122. Rabbi Shapira viewed the Shattering of the Vessels as a cosmic shattering that could recur in another time. In Esh Kadosh, Rabbi Shapira presents the theory that such an event was averted because of the deaths of the Ten Martyrs. He also viewed the Holocaust, which he experienced firsthand in the Warsaw Ghetto, as a time of the Breaking of the Vessels. But rather than simply view this as a time of cosmic catastrophe, he was true to his own myth, asserting instead that it was a time for renewal and new creation. And for him the primary task of renewal was repentance. Only in this way could all the worlds be mended.",

      "content": "When God decided to create Adam, He gathered dust from the four comers of the earth, rolled it together, mixed it with water, and made red clay. Then God shaped the clay into a lifeless body, the first golem, stretching from one end of the world to the other, and brought it to life. So large was it, that God's hand rested upon it. So large was it, that wherever God looked. He saw it. That is the meaning of the verse Your eyes saw my golem (Ps. 139:16). So huge was it, that the angels mistook it for God Himself, and they wanted to say \"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts.\" So God caused sleep to fall upon him, so that all knew he was but a mortal man.",
      "commentary": "While the golem of Adam lay sleeping, God whispered in his ear the secrets of Creation, and showed Adam the righteous of every generation, and the wicked as well, until the time when the dead will be raised. Indeed, God showed him every righteous man who would ever descend from him, every generation and its judges, scribes, prophets, and leaders. So too did God show him every generation and its saints and sinners. And as God spoke, Adam witnessed everything as if he were there. Some of the righteous hung on Adam's head, some hung to his hair, some to his forehead, some to his eyes, some to his nose, some to his mouth, some to his ears, some to his teeth. And later, when Adam did come to life, he dimly remembered all that God had revealed when he was only a golem. And at night, in his dreams, he still heard God's voice recounting mysteries, and telling of all that would take place in the days to come. In those dreams Adam would travel to those places and see the events firsthand, as a witness. And since there is a spark of Adam's soul in every one of his descendants, there are a few in every generation who still hear the voice of God in their dreams. \"Golem\" means \"a formless body.\" In shaping Adam's body out of clay, God created the first golem. There are stories in the Talmud and medieval Jewish lore that describe the creation of golems, one a calf that was eaten on the Sabbath, one a man of clay animated by the fourth century Rabbi Rava, and one a woman golem that Ibn Gabirol is said to have made out of wood. Later the famous legend of the golem of the Maharal recounted how he created a man out of clay in much the same way that God did, using the powers of what is known as practical kabbalah. The fact that the golem of the Maharal is mute and cannot reproduce demonstrates that man's creation is less perfect than God's. It also demonstrates man's desire to take on the powers of God and act in a godlike fashion. The righteous who cling to the golem of Adam represent the qualities that each of the righteous emphasized. See \"The Golem of Prague,\" p. 281. According to Midrash ha-Ne'elam, Zohar Hadash 17c-d, God gathered the dust for Adam's body from the site where the Temple in Jerusalem would be built in the future, and drew down his soul from the celestial Temple. One of the important questions about the creation of Adam asks whether God created Adam by Himself, or if the angels played a role in his creation. Many midrashim describe Gabriel's role in gathering dust from the four comers of the earth. In contrast, 4 Ezra insists that God created Adam entirely by Himself: \"Adam was the workmanship of Your hands, and You breathed into him the breath of life, and he was made alive in Your presence. And You led him into the garden which Your right hand had planted before the earth appeared\" (4 Ezra 3:4-6).",

      "title": "Adam The Last And First",
      "content": "When God wished to create the world. His first work of Creation was none other than Adam. First God made a lifeless body. But when He was about to instill a soul in him, God said, \"If I finish his creation now, he will claim that he was My partner in the work of Creation. Therefore I shall leave him as a lifeless body until I create everything.\" When God had completed everything else, the angels said to Him: \"Are You going to make man, as You said you would?\" God answered: \"I have already made him, and all he lacks is the infusion of a soul. When he receives this, he will reign on the earth, and there will be nothing comparable to him, even among the other creatures that exist. I will call his name Adam.\" So God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul (Gen. 2:7). That is why it is said that Adam was the last and first, for God began and completed the creation of the world with him, as it is said. Last and first You did form me (Ps. 139:5).",
      "commentary": "This myth is a polemic about the traditions that indicate that God shared some of the work of creation with a heavenly Adam. Since this implies Gnostic duality and threatens monotheism, the present myth is offered as an antidote. It says that yes, Adam was God's first creation, but only his lifeless body. God held off giving him a soul until the sixth day, as is stated in Genesis 2:7: Then God formed man of the dust of the ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul This myth serves to prove that Adam was not God's partner in Creation. This is stated explicitly in B. Sanhedrin 38a: \"Adam was created last on the eve of the Sabbath. Why? Lest the heretics should say, 'God has a partner in the work of Creation.'\" Here, as in the other passages, the phrase \"lest the heretics should say\" indicates that there were those who did say such things. Because the existence of such a partner for God would dispute monotheism, those who argued for such a partner are regarded as heretics — minim. In this case it is likely that the heretics the rabbis had in mind were the Gnostics, who taught that everything came into being through Adam. A similar tradition about Adam is found in 2 Enoch 30:11-12, where God says, \"I assigned him (Adam) to be a second angel, honored and glorious. I assigned him to be a king, to reign on earth and to have My wisdom. There was nothing comparable to him, not even among the angels.\" The Testament of Abraham, chapter 8 (rec. B) goes even further, describing Adam as sitting upon a throne of glory at the gates of Paradise, surrounded by angels. Later, in the same text, Adam is described as \"adorned in glory, with a terrifying appearance, like that of the Lord\" (chapter 11, rec. A.) Here Adam clearly plays a demiurgic role. \"Adam the Last and First\" alerts us to an entire category of polemical myths. A classic example of such a myth is the talmudic account of Elisha ben Abuyah's vision of Metatron. Here Elisha was said to have seen Metatron seated on a heavenly throne. Since he had understood that there was no sitting in heaven other than for God, he announces, \"There must be two powers in heaven\" (B. Hagigah 15a). The intention of this myth is clear: to undermine the extensive myths about Enoch /Metatron, demonstrating that such belief in Metatron as the Prince of the Presence, the second in command after God, would endanger belief in monotheism. Here it causes Elisha to become an apostate, thereafter known as Aher , \"the Other.\" See \"A Vision of Metatron,\" p. 174. Another example of a polemical myth is that of the homunculus of Maimonides, probably created by the opponents of Maimonides in the anti-Maimonidian controversy. See \"The Homunculus of Maimonides,\" p. 284. See also \"The Image of Jacob Cast Out of Heaven,\" p. 368 for a third example of a polemical myth. This is a polemic against the myths that raise Jacob from a human to a heavenly figure, another example of the First Created Being. This myth has God cast Jacob's image, which was on God's throne, out of heaven.",

That chariot soared over the entire world, and Abraham beheld all that took place that day in the lives of men, both good and evil. He saw births, wedding processions, and the dead being borne to their tombs. Then the chariot reached the first gate of heaven. There Abraham saw that there were two paths, one broad and one straight and narrow. And they saw many souls driven by angels through the broad gate, and a few other souls led by angels through the narrow gate. And outside the two gates they saw a man seated on a golden throne, adorned in glory. And when the man on the throne saw the many souls driven through the broad gate, he threw himself on the ground and wept and grieved. But when he saw the souls entering through the straight gate, he rejoiced and exulted. Seeing this, Abraham asked the angel Michael who that wondrous man was, and Michael told him that it was Adam, the first to be formed, who was enthroned there. He observes the world and all those who live there, since everyone has descended from him. And when he sees souls entering through the gate of the righteous, which leads to life, he rejoices. But when he sees all those who enter by the gate of the sinners, which leads to destruction, he weeps and wails.",
      "commentary": "This myth about Adam being seated on a golden throne in heaven comes out of a tradition that elevated Adam to the status of a divine being. This myth also belongs to the tradition of other enthronement myths, such as those about Enoch, Jacob, Moses, and King David that are found in a variety of sources, especially the Pseudepigrapha. In a variety of myths, Adam is portrayed as a divine figure. In some he is described as a giant reaching from earth to heaven. See \"Adam the Giant,\" p. 128. In others he is described as an enormous golem, as big as this world, asleep in paradise. See \"Adam the Golem,\" p. 127. Here, Adam is portrayed as a figure seated on a golden throne who either rejoices at the fate of righteous souls who enter paradise, or mourns over the fate of those souls driven away from a heavenly reward. Adam's great concern for them grows out of his role as their ancestor, the first man. Indeed, he regards them all as his children. Underlying this enthronement myth is the view that Adam must be regarded as a divine figure, who shares the duties of ruling the world with God. It is evidence of the survival of Jewish Gnosticism, primarily in the texts of the Pseudepigrapha, as here, from The Testament of Abraham.",

      "content": "When the time came for the first man to be created, God called upon the angel Michael, and ordered him to form Adam from the dust of the earth. First Michael gathered dust from the four comers of the earth — though some say that the dust came from the Holy Land, from the place where the altar of the Temple would one day be built. Then Michael shaped him into a clay figure in the image of God, as it is said. In the image of God he created him (Gen. 1:27). God then breathed into the clay figure a soul from the Heavenly Temple, and Adam opened his eyes. The notion that someone other than God gathered the dust from which Adam was created finds its source in the verse Make for me an altar of earth (Exod. 20:21). In some versions (such as Midrash Konen), it is Gabriel, rather than Michael, who is sent to gather the dust. One midrash holds that the earth refused Gabriel, so that God reached out and gathered the dust from the four comers of the earth Himself. In other versions, such as Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 12, it is said that God took the dust from which He created Adam from the site of the Temple, as this was a holy and pure place, or that Adam's bones were created there. Other sources say that Adam's body came from Babylon, his head from the Land of Israel, and his limbs from the other lands. Some sources, such as 4 Ezra 3:4, emphatically deny that God was assisted in the creation of the world or of man: \"O Lord, did You not speak when You created earth, which You did without help, and command the dust, so that it gave You Adam?\" In Against Apion 2:192, Josephus makes a similar point: \"God created the world and its contents not with hands, not with toil, and not with assistants, for He had no need of them. He willed it into existence.\" Michael's forming the body of Adam by himself is parallel to Prometheus forming man out of clay and water. See Graves, The Greek Myths , 4c and 4.3. Graves calls the archangel Michael the counterpart of Prometheus. The Prometheus myth also finds a parallel in Judaism in the myth about Adam stealing light from heaven and bringing it to earth. See \"Adam Brings Down Fire from Heaven,\" p. 137.",

      "content": "Such is the story of heaven and earth when they were created. When the Lord God made earth and heaven — when no shrub of the field was yet on earth and no grasses of the field had yet sprouted, because the Lord God had not sent rain upon the earth and there was no man to till the soil, but a flow would well up from the ground and water the whole surface of the earth— the Lord God formed man from the dust of the earth. He blew into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living being. Some midrashim say that God sent the angel Michael (or Gabriel) to gather the earth from which Adam was to be made from each of the four comers of the world, so that people could be buried anywhere, without the earth objecting that he had not come from that place. Another interpretation is found in Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 12, where it is said that God took Adam's dust from a pure place, the place of the Temple. Nachmanides, in Perush Ramban al ha-Torah on Genesis 1:26, identifies two stages in which Adam received his soul. First God placed a life force {nefesh) within him. Later, God breathed a higher soul (neshamah) into him. Parallels to the biblical account of the creation of man are found in the Mesopotamian myths of Atrahasis, the Enuma Elish, and the epic of Gilgamesh. In the stories of Atrahasis, humans were created by Mami, the mother goddess, with the help of the god Ea, out of clay mixed with the blood of the slain god Geshtu-e. A similar myth is found in Enuma Elish, in which the god Marduk, with the help of Ea, created mankind using the blood of Qingu, slain leader of the enemy gods. In Gilgamesh , Enkidu is parallel to Adam and Dilmun is parallel to Eden. To civilize the savage Enkidu, a woman is sent to be his companion, who seduces him for six days and seven nights, and turns him into a civilized man.",

      "content": "Adam was not created by God's pronouncement, as were other creations, but with God's own hands, as it is said. You lay Your Hand upon me (Ps. 139:5). Indeed, Adam was created by a mold that was made especially for him. This is the meaning of And God created man in his image (Gen. 1:27). Some say that God created this mold when He said, \" Let us make man in our image\" (Gen. 1:26). Others say that God used the mold of the angels, who also walk erect, since, in any case, God does not have an image or form. Everything made with a human mold is identical. But such is God's power that although each person is created with the same mold used for the first man, no two are alike. Genesis 1:27 is usually translated And God created man in His image, but here the word tzelem, usually translated as \"image,\" is understood to mean \"mold.\" This myth explains how it is that all humans beings seem to be made in the same mold. The mold can also be understood as an archetype, and Adam, as the first human being, is the archetype of all subsequent humans. Nevertheless, no two people are alike. The myth also raises the possibility that God used the mold with which he created the angels to create humans. This follows the tradition that humans and angels have similar forms. Finally, the myth emphasizes that while angels and humans may have been created from a mold, God does not have an image or form.",

So that man's rightful actions might be attributed to God, but his sins to others. For it was not fitting that the road to wickedness should be God's making. Therefore, on the sixth day God commanded Wisdom to create man. Wisdom is said to have been one of God's earliest creations, as stated in Proverbs 3:19: Yahweh founded the earth by Wisdom (Prov. 3:19). In most traditions this personification of Wisdom simply serves as a witness of God's subsequent creations, to testify that no others were involved. But here God assigns Wisdom the task of creating human beings.

      "content": "Before God created Adam, there were two formations, that of the celestial creatures and that of the earthly creatures. The angels and other celestial beings were created in the image of God, but they did not reproduce, while the animals and other earthly beings reproduced, but they were not created in the image of God. God decided that man would be created in His image, like the celestial beings, but that he would also reproduce, like the terrestrial beings. God said, \"If I create man out of celestial elements, he will live forever. And if I create him out of terrestrial elements, his life will be brief. Therefore I will create him out of both celestial and terrestrial elements. The choice will be his: if he sins, he will die; if he does not sin, he will be immortal.\"",
      "commentary": "This myth presents God debating with Himself about whether Adam and all subsequent human beings should share the characteristics of the celestial beings, especially their immortality, or those of the terrestrial beings, in particular, their inevitable mortality. God decides to leave the choice to Adam, thus setting the stage for the divine test that takes place in the Garden of Eden, where God tells Adam that he may eat of any trees in the garden except for the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Since Adam and Eve eat the forbidden fruit, they unknowingly lose their chance to have eternal life. Thus this myth supplies the missing explanation of God's intention in commanding Adam to avoid eating from the Tree of Knowledge. Genesis Rabbah 14:3 explains that human beings share four characteristics with the celestial beings: they were created in the image of God, they stand upright, they speak and understand, and they have peripheral vision. Likewise, humans share four characteristics with animals: they eat and drink, they procreate, they excrete, and they die. Thus humans share characteristics with both the celestial and terrestrial beings. This explains the proverb that humans are a little lower than the angels.",

The purpose of this myth is to demonstrate that God was evenhanded in Creation, alternating between creating above and creating below, so as not to anger either the heavens or the earth.

      "content": "On each of the first five days of Creation, God created three kinds of creatures. But on the sixth day, the day before the Sabbath, He was occupied the entire day with the making of Adam. These were the first twelve hours of Adam's life: In the first hour, Adam came into being as a thought. In the second hour, God consulted the ministering angels concerning him. In the third hour, God gathered the dust out of which He was to make Adam. In the fourth hour, God kneaded the dust. In the fifth, God shaped the dust into the shape of a man. In the sixth, God stood him on his feet, and he reached from earth to heaven. In the seventh hour God blew the breath of life into him. In the eighth, God brought him into the Garden of Eden. In the ninth hour, God told him that he could eat of the fruit of any tree in the Garden except for the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. In the tenth hour Adam sinned. In the eleventh hour, he was brought to justice. In the twelfth, the verdict was given and he was expelled from the Garden of Eden. Here Adam's life in the Garden of Eden is presented as having taken place in twelve hours, from the time he was created until the time he was expelled from Eden. Midrash Tehillim states that Adam was only saved from destruction in Gehenna by the plea of the Sabbath, which brought about his expulsion instead. There are alternate versions of this myth about Adam's creation. According to B. Sanhedrin 38b, Adam's dust was gathered in the first hour. In the second hour it was kneaded into a shapeless mass. In the third hour its limbs were shaped. In the fourth, a soul was infused into that clay body and he came to life. In the fifth, he arose and stood on his feet. In the sixth, he named the animals. In the seventh, Eve became his mate. In the eighth, Adam and Eve lay down together as two and arose as four, for Cain and Abel were conceived. (Others say that two lay down together and seven arose: Cain and his twin sister, and Abel and his two twin sisters.) In the ninth, Adam was commanded not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge. In the tenth, he sinned. In the eleventh, he was tried. In the twelfth hour he was expelled from Eden. There are numerous variants of this myth. Leviticus Rabbah, for example, explains that Adam was judged in the eleventh hour and pardoned in the twelfth. Why were these events collapsed into a 12-hour myth? It is possible that the hours are God's hours, each of which would be years for a human, just as a year of God is said to consist of a thousand human years. On the other hand, it is possible to see these 12 hours as collapsed time, where everything that happens to Adam, from his creation to his expulsion, was driven by some powerful force well beyond his understanding.",

      "title": "Adam Brings Down Fire From Heaven",
      "content": "Some say that before Adam existed as a mortal, he lived in heaven, and that he not only brought down fire from heaven, but he brought down light as well. When Adam took the fire from heaven and descended with it, the whole sky was filled with fire, as if it were descending to set the world ablaze. At that moment, God signed a decree with His seal, relinquishing control of fire in the world, as it is said, \"My word is like fire\" (Jer. 23:29). As for the light that Adam brought down from on high, some say that the light shone from Adam's fingernails, which reflected brighter than the sun. Others say that Adam used the four winds of the world to bring down the light. Still others say that Adam used enchanted stones to bring light into the world. One was the stone of darkness, and the other, the stone of dimness, as it is said. The stones of thick darkness and the shadow of death (Job 28:3). From this we learn, though how is a mystery, that using darkness and death, Adam brought light into the world.",
      "commentary": "This is an explicitly Jewish Promethean myth, with Adam playing the role of Prometheus. Just as Prometheus lit a torch from the fiery chariot of the sun and gave the fire to mankind as an act of rebellion against heaven, here Adam is not only credited for having brought fire to earth, but also for having brought light. This addition gives Adam the status of a divine figure, perhaps even a demiurgic one. After all, bringing light into the world is a God-like act, since it is God who says \" Let there be light\" (Gen. 1:3). It might even appear that this myth had taken the myth of Prometheus and expanded it, adding light. For more on the myth of Prometheus giving fire to mankind, see Graves, The Greek Myths , 39g. Like Prometheus, Adam is portrayed in this myth as a divine figure, a heavenly being. Both of them steal fire from heaven and give it to mankind. While Prometheus lights a torch at the fiery chariot of the sun and gives mankind a glowing coal, Adam brings down a metaphorical fire, linked to God's word by the verse My word is like fire (Jer. 23:29). In this regard, Adam's gift of fire is parallel to Moses receiving the gift of the Torah from God at Mount Sinai. Is Adam's act in bringing down fire and light from heaven an act of rebellion as was that of Prometheus? It might be seen as another version of the Fall. Here, instead of eating the forbidden fruit, the cosmic Adam took fire and light from heaven. This interpretation is supported by Genesis 3:9: \" Behold , the man has become like one of us, knowing good and bad. \" In this context, Adam's sin and the forces that it released into the world are parallel to stealing the fire and light of heaven. The motif of Adam using his fingernails to bring down light from heaven is quite striking. It seems like an intentional reference to the Havdalah custom of turning one's fingernails toward a flame so that the light reflects in them. The implication is that there was enough light reflected from Adam's fingernails — which had been exposed to the light of heaven — to illumine the world. One obscure myth indicates that Adam brought light into the world by using the stones of darkness and the stones of dimness. This myth is derived from the verse in Job 28:3, The stones of thick darkness and the shadow of death. It seems to imply that light was created out of darkness and death. It also seems to imply that night was created out of darkness and death. Another Jewish Promethean myth is found in the interpretations of Genesis 6 about the sons of God and the daughters of men. This is read as an account of angels who descended to earth, promising God to be righteous, and instead chased after the beautiful human women. See \"The Sons of God and the Daughters of Men,\" p. 454, for the original myth in this cycle.",

      "title": "Adam The Hermaphrodite",
      "content": "Some say that Adam was originally created with two faces, one male and one female, one facing forward and one behind, as it is said, Male and female He created them (Gen. 1:27). Others say that Adam and Eve were created as a single being, with Adam in front and Eve in back, so that Adam's back was in the shape of Eve. How did this happen? God had originally intended to create two people, but ultimately only one was brought into being. But facing in two directions made walking difficult, and conversation awkward. So God changed His mind and split Adam into two, making two backs, one for Adam and one for Eve, and dividing them into two separate beings. Then there are those who say that Adam lost his second face in a different way, through his sin. For when Adam sinned, God took away one of his faces. The myth of Adam the Hermaphrodite grows out of three biblical verses: Male and female He created them (Gen. 1:27), He blessed them and called them Man (Adam) (Gen. 5:2), and. You have shaped me from the back and the front (Ps. 139:5). But instead of describing Adam and Eve as two people joined into one, Shoher Tov 139:5 suggests that \" Adam's back was in the shape of Eve.\" The rabbis also concluded that the man's face went first, because of the teaching that a man should not walk behind a woman on the road. One rabbi. Rabbi Jeremiah ben Eleazar, identifies Adam as a hermaphrodite, thus a being with two sexes. Another rabbi, Rabbi Samuel bar Nachman, identifies Adam as a double-faced being who was later split by God into two. Some versions say that God \"sawed\" Adam in two, a rather grisly image. The bumps of the spine are said to be evidence of the separation that took place. Other readings of this myth also indicate that man and woman emerged from a single being. This is true, for example, in the sense that Eve was created from Adam's rib. Before Eve was created, then, her potential existed within Adam. Thus Adam and Eve were once a single being, not in the sense of separate beings fused together, but in the sense of having both male and female qualities.",
      "commentary": "This myth acknowledges that God made a mistake, an idea that borders on heresy, since God is understood to intrinsically be perfect, and therefore incapable of a mistake. But the actual portrayal of God in the rabbinic texts presents God in a wide range of roles, ordering the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and then regretting it bitterly, or allowing Himself to be overruled by His children. Such a God is almost human, with a complex persona that includes the capacity of being contradictory or of making errors. See the Introduction, p. xlvi. What other errors has God made? Some regard the Shattering of the Vessels in the myth of the Ari to be another example of a divine error, since the vessels shattered before they reached their original destination. See \"The Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks,\" p. 122. This myth is a very clear parallel to a Greek myth found in pre-Socratic sources, and most famously in Plato's Symposium 189a-190a, that every person seeks to find his or her other half. That myth is intended to explain the nature of Eros as a craving for completeness, since each person is only a part of what he or she once was. This mean-",

This Lilith has the form of a beautiful woman from her head to her waist, but from the waist down she is burning fire. Samael grew exceedingly jealous of Ashmedai because of Lilith the Younger, and this pleased the younger Lilith immensely, as she seeks, above all, to incite wars, especially the war between herself and her mother.

The swarming of spirits around Adam resembles the myth about swarms of demons attempting to seduce Adam during the 130-year period in which he was separated from Eve.

      "content": "Adam's first wife was a clever woman who was stronger than he was. Therefore Adam said to God, \"Please God. I don't want this woman. Take her and give me another one instead.\" God listened to Adam's request and was about to cast the first Eve into the sea, when she said, \"Before you take me, I ask you to give me one request.\" God said, \"What is it?\" The first Eve said, \"When a baby boy is bom, let me come to him on the fifth day after his birth and reveal the future that is awaiting him.\" God agreed to this request, and every time that a son is born, the first Eve comes to him on the fifth day after he is bom, and whispers the future in his ear. One hundred years later God remembered Adam's request for a new woman. So God put him to sleep, took his left rib, and created a new woman from it. This woman was modest and quiet. He called her Eve.",
      "commentary": "This is an interesting oral variant of the myth of the first Eve. See the preceding myth. On one level it's a rather primitive tale in which Adam rejects Eve because she is superior to him, and God agrees to get rid of her. But the myth also establishes a custom whereby the first Eve is said to reveal a boy's future on the fifth day after his birth, three days before the b'rit. Of course, the infant is not likely to remember this prophecy. This is not a widely known tradition, though perhaps it has more resonance among Indian Jews, where the story originated. Just as the amulet against Lilith will protect a newborn boy for eight days— until the b'rit — so this fifth day role for the first Eve creates a birth custom for her, perpetuating the need for her existence, and preserving her from the oblivion of being uncreated. There are also indications that this myth is a variant of the Lilith myth. Like Lilith, the first Eve is described here as cleverer than he is. Also, the punishment that God plans for her— casting her into the sea— is the same punishment that the angels threaten Lilith with unless she returns to her spouse. Finally, God's agreement that the first Eve may reveal a boy's future to him on the fifth day after birth echoes Lilith's vow that the amulet against her will protect newborn baby boys until the eighth day, when they will be protected by the circumcision. See \"Adam and Lilith,\" p. 216 and \"A Spell to Banish Lilith,\" p. 218.",

      "commentary": "This is the famous account from Genesis of how God created Eve out of Adam's rib. It is one of the few creation stories in world mythology in which the first woman was created from the first man, instead of the other way around. Since humans are bom from women, the myth stands out as an obvious example of a male myth. Nevertheless, the fact that Eve was said to have been created from Adam's rib is a clear indication that she was bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh (Gen. 2:23)— thus that they were created from one flesh, a view that makes bonding between the man and woman much easier. In subsequent translations of the Bible and in the rabbinic texts, the story of Eve's creation from Adam's rib was elaborated. In one text, for example, the rib was identified as the 13th rib on the right side. The rib, of course, is integral to the biblical account, but the midrashic process proposed that Eve might have been created from something else. Some say that Eve was created from a face — one of the two faces with which Adam was created, before God divided Adam and Eve into separate beings. (See \"Adam the Hermaphrodite,\" p. 138.) Still others say that Eve was created from a tail, and that Satan was created along with her. The suggestion that Eve was created",

      "content": "God had already created the earth, the sun, the moon, and the stars. All of the animals were in the Garden of Eden. The time had come for Adam, the first man, to be created. God called upon the angel Gabriel to bring clay from each of the four comers of the earth, the north, the south, the east, and the west. This the angel did, and then God formed a clay man and breathed the breath of life into him and the man opened his eyes and began to breathe. Adam gave names to all the animals and explored the Garden of Eden. But God saw that Adam was lonely, and He decided to create a mate for him. So one day, when Adam was strolling about in the Garden of Eden, God put Adam to sleep, and while he was deeply dreaming, God took out one of his ribs, and with that rib God created Eve, the first woman. When Adam awoke and saw Eve standing in front of him, their faces illuminating each other, he understood at once that he had found his true mate. God introduced Adam to Eve and explained how she had been created. Then Adam embraced her and kissed her and said, \" This one at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. This one shall be called Woman, for from man was she taken \" (Gen. 2:23). Then God knew that the time had come for the world's first wedding. God Himself prepared tables of precious pearls and filled them with delicacies. God also created ten wedding canopies for them, all made of precious gems, pearls, and gold. So too did He attire Eve, the first bride, in a beautiful wedding dress, and braid her hair and adorn her with twenty-four different ornaments. As the ceremony began, the ministering angels walked before Adam, leading him beneath the wedding canopies. Michael and Gabriel were Adam's groomsmen. Then God Himself brought the bride to Adam and stood before them like a cantor, and took the cup of blessing and blessed them, as it is said, God blessed them (Gen. 1:28). As soon as Adam and Eve were wed, still other angels descended to the Garden of Eden, playing music for the newlyweds, beating tambourines and dancing to pipes. So too did the sun, the moon and the stars dance for them, and all of creation joined in the celebration of the world's first wedding. Sefer ha-Zikhronot explains that while each bridegroom generally has only one huppah (a wedding canopy), and a king has three, God made ten canopies for Adam in order to show great honor to the first man. The jewels covering them are all different: chalcedony, topaz, diamond, beryl, onyx, jasper, sapphire, emerald, carbuncle, and gold. This list is drawn from Ezekiel 28:18. The twenty-four ornaments that Eve wore are listed in Isaiah 3:18-24. There is a debate among the rabbis recounted in Genesis Rabbah as to how many canopies God created for Adam. While the number generally given is ten, some rabbis argued there were 11 or 13. One of the wedding blessings for every Jewish couple is that they attain the holiness and joy granted to Adam and Eve on the day of their wedding.",

      "content": "Adam was not the first man that God attempted to create. Little record remains of these early attempts that were created and then destroyed, or permitted to become extinct. But it is known that before God created Adam, He created a creature called Adne Sadeh. This creature had a form that closely resembled that of man, but Adne Sadeh was attached to the earth by means of a navel cord, upon which its life depended. This cord, it is true, sometimes grew to great lengths of more than a mile, but in any case the creature was confined to this radius, for if the cord snapped its life would end. Thus the creature sustained itself with those fruits and vegetables that grew within the circle, and by occasionally capturing animals who approached it too closely. The life span of Adne Sadeh was very long, and there was little that could take its life, short of a flood or other disaster, unless its cord was snapped. Thus this species continued to exist until the last members were drowned in the Flood. There are some fantastic creatures recounted in Jewish lore. Adne Sadeh is a kind of primitive man who was said to be tied to the earth by his navel cord. Midrash Tanhuma tells of a traveler who was served this creature, who was regarded as a vegetable rather than a man. Afraid that he had fallen among cannibals, he ran away as quickly as he could. Ma'aseh Buch tells of a traveling rabbi who was served what appeared to be human hands, but that turned out to be a vegetable that looked like a human hand. This too may be linked to the myth of the \"vegetable man.\" Louis Ginzberg describes Adne Sadeh as a \"man of the mountains,\" and suggests that he was some kind of ape.",

Some say its head reaches as far as the Throne of Glory, where it sings songs to God. It is so big that when the Ziz unfolds its wings, it blots out the sun. Once the sailors on a passing ship saw the Ziz standing there and thought the water must be shallow. Then a voice called out from heaven: \"Don't dive in here! A carpenter dropped his axe here seven years ago, and it still has not reached the bottom.\" Another time, one of the eggs of the Ziz fell to earth and crushed a forest of three hundred trees. The liquid from the broken egg flooded sixty cities. The Ziz serves as a messenger of God. Once King Solomon learned that a heavenly voice had announced that his daughter, the princess, was destined to marry a poor man within a year. To keep this from happening. King Solomon sent his daughter to live in a high tower in a desert island. Then it happened that the Ziz carried a poor youth from Acco to the balcony of that tower, so that die princess and youth were brought together. And he lived secretly in that tower with her, and before the year was out they were wed, for not even King Solomon could outfox fate.",
      "commentary": "So too did the Ziz pick up a young scholar named Shlomo from the roof of his house where he was studying and drop him in the garden of the king of Spain. The king took a liking to him, and let him live in a hut in the garden. There he met and fell in love with the princess, who studied Torah with him and secretly married him. But then the Ziz picked him up out of that garden and brought him back to the roof of his parents' house. In this way Shlomo was separated from the princess, but after great trials she found her way back to him. The flesh of the Ziz will be served to the righteous at the messianic banquet that will take place at the end of days. The Ziz is one of three mythical gigantic creatures that often appear in Jewish lore. The others are Leviathan and Behemoth. The Ziz is mentioned in Psalms 50:11: And Ziz-Sadai is with Me. In Jewish folklore the Ziz serves as the incarnation of fate. The two folktales noted are two famous examples. See \"The Princess in the Tower\" in Elijah's Violin , pp. 47-52, and \"The Flight of the Eagle,\" pp. 82-88 in the same book. The account of the sighting of the Ziz by a passing ship is attributed to Rabbah bar Bar Hannah, a talmudic sage who reported on many strange sightings in his sea and land journeys. These are found in B. Bava Batra 73a-74a. Because of their outlandish nature, the tall tales of Rabbah bar Bar Hannah were often interpreted allegorically. The Maharsha, Rabbi Samuel Eliezer Edels, interpreted these fables this way, as did Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav. For the Maharsha, the waters that first appear shallow but turn out to be very deep represent the Torah, which may appear to be only ankle deep, but is actually profound and difficult to fathom. The bird's head that reaches the sky represents the hidden aspects of the Torah — the secrets of kabbalah. In Likutei Moharan , Rabbi Nachman expands on the Maharsha's interpretation in which the deep waters represent the deepest secrets of the Torah. He interprets the voice that warned against diving in as a warning to those who are not trained in the Torah against seeking out its deepest secrets. This is the esoteric view taken by kabbalah and succeeding stages of Jewish mysticism. Rabbi Nachman sees the carpenter as God, and the axe dropped into the sea as the Messiah, since the Messiah is called God's \"axe.\" He finds that the reference to seven years refers to the 7,000 years that the world is supposed to exist. Most interesting is Rabbi Nachman's interpretation that the falling of the axe refers to the Messiah's own probing of the deepest secrets of the Torah. And when he reaches those secrets, then the messianic era will arrive. When that takes place, the Messiah will reveal these secrets to the whole world. Note that here Rabbi Nachman has created a new messianic myth. It is said that the Ziz, like Leviathan, will be served to the righteous at the messianic banquet at the End of Days. From this the rabbis concluded that the Ziz must be kosher. See \"The Messianic Banquet,\" p. 508.",

Before long the re’em awoke and rose up, and David, astride its horns, was lifted as high as the heavens. Then God caused a lion to appear, coming toward the re'em. When the re’em saw the lion, the king of beasts, it knelt down in fear. David was also afraid, so God caused a gazelle to come along, and as the lion sprang after it, David descended the horn of the re'em and escaped. That is the meaning of the words of the Psalm: Deliver me from a lion's mouth, rescue me from the horns of a re’em (Ps. 22:22). The re’em is a homed mythological creature of great size, similar to a unicorn or a rhinoceros. This legend about King David explains the enigmatic meaning of Psalm 22:22 by offering an account of the young shepherd David escaping both from the re'em and a lion. Compare the account of the death of Cain said to explain the meaning of Genesis 4:23. See \"The Death of Cain,\" p. 451.

And before long his prayer was answered, and the lion emerged from the forest and set out for the city of Rome. And when the lion was at a distance of four hundred parasangs, it roared once, the ground shook, and all the bridges of Rome collapsed. When it was at a distance of three hundred parasangs, it roared a second time, the molars and front teeth of the people fell out, and Caesar himself fell from his throne to the floor.

      "content": "The ram that Abraham found caught in the thicket at Mount Moriah was one of the ten things created on the eve of the first Sabbath, along with the rainbow of Noah, the staff of Moses, and other precious things. The ram waited in Paradise for many centuries until that fateful day on Mount Moriah. All this time the ram knew why it had been created, but it was not afraid. Instead, it looked forward to fulfilling its destiny. Then the day came when the angel brought the ram from Paradise to serve as the sacrifice in place of Isaac at Mount Moriah. There, its horns caught in the thicket, it waited for Abraham to set it free. That is why God said to Abraham, \"Although your children are destined to be entangled in misfortune, in the end they will be redeemed by the horns of a ram.\" Nothing of the ram that was sacrificed there was wasted. The skin of the ram became Elijah's mantle, the gut was used in David's harp, one horn was sounded by Moses at Mount Sinai, and the other will be blown by Elijah at the End of Days, as it is said. And in that day, a great ram's horn shall be sounded (Isa. 27:13). For a list of the other things created on the eve of the first Sabbath, see \"Ten Things Created on the Eve of the First Sabbath,\" p. 77. The ram does not appear in all such lists, which vary considerably. See \"The Ram Whose Homs Reached Into Heaven\" in Gabriel's Palace, pp. 137-138. For a modem midrash about the ram, see \"The Tale of the Ram\" by Tsvi Blanchard in Gates to the New City: A Treasury of Modem Jewish Tales, p. 152.",

      "content": "God is a potter who, in turning His wheel, constantly fashions new vessels, as it is said, He revolves wheels by his devices 0ob. 37:12). Using the instrument of the potter's wheel, God endlessly reshapes His works, turning one vessel into another. If a man's works are good, the potter's wheel revolves to the right, making the course of events highly favorable. For those who turn to evil ways, however, God imparts a spin to the left, and events follow an unfavorable course. Thus, through these rotations of the wheel, everything turns out as it should. In this allegorical myth God is described as a potter, who creates new vessels at His wheel— thus, creates new creations. While these are similar to the old creations, each new one is still unique. This metaphor about God being a potter was likely inspired by Job 37:12, which can be rendered. He revolves wheels by his devices. For a parallel theme, see \"Re-creating the World,\" p. 292.",

This teaching is attributed to Rabbi Simcha Bunam of Parsischa (1765-1827). He observes that the unfinished nature of Creation is a necessity, not a flaw, for the world requires constant renewal. Without this force of renewal, the world would come to an end. The Ba'al Shem Tov also taught that the world is renewed daily.",

      "content": "When Enoch had lived sixty-five years, he begat Methuselah. After the birth of Methuselah, Enoch walked with God three hundred years; and he begat sons and daughters. All the days of Enoch came to three hundred and sixty-five years. Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, for God took him. This brief biblical passage is the basis of the enormous Enoch tradition, or else it is the summary of a prebiblical tradition concerning Enoch. Because of the verse Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, for God took him (Gen. 5:24), the tradition grew that Enoch had not died, but had been transported into heaven in a chariot, where he was transformed into the angel Metatron. The primary texts about Enoch are 1 Enoch and 2 Enoch and the Hekhalot text that is often called 3 Enoch in the Pseudepigrapha. It seems significant that Enoch is said to have lived 365 years. This seems to associate him with the yearly cycle of the sun, perhaps indicating that the myth of Enoch includes some remnants of sun worship that have survived in Judaism. Likewise, Enoch's metamorphosis into the fiery angel Metatron seems to affirm this link to the sun. See \"The Metamorphosis and Enthronement of Enoch,\" p. 156.",

Fire surrounded the walls of the house, and its portals blazed with fire. Its ceiling was like the path of the stars and lightning, and there were fiery cherubim between them. In the vision Enoch entered that house, and it was as hot as fire and as cold as ice. Quaking and trembling, Enoch fell on his face and had another vision. Here he saw a second house, greater than the first, built entirely of flames. Its splendor and magnificence cannot be described. Its floor and ceiling were made of fire, and the fiery portal stood open before him. And Enoch saw a lofty throne within, and its appearance was as crystal, and from beneath the throne came streams of flaming fire, and the wheels of the throne shone as brightly as the sun. And there, seated on the throne, was the great glory of God, His garment whiter than any snow, its light brighter than the sun, the moon, and the stars. A flaming fire was around Him, and a great fire stood before Him, and none could draw near him.",

      "content": "The angels who serve God one day do not serve him the next. Every single day new ministering angels are created from the River of Fire, known as Rigyon. This is the river of which it is written, A river of fire streamed forth before Him (Dan. 7:10). This river springs out of the perspiration of the heavenly creatures who support God's Throne of Glory and emerges from under the throne. There are a great many bridges of fire that have been placed over the river of fire, for the souls of the righteous to cross. Before they can sing before God, all the angels must first go down and bathe themselves in the river of fire, and dip their tongues and mouths in the river seven times. Then they encircle the Throne of Glory, singing hymns of praise to God unceasingly from sunrise to sunset, as it is said. From east to west the name ofYahweh is praised (Ps. 113:3). But those angels who serve Him today, do not serve Him tomorrow. And those who serve Him tomorrow will never serve Him again. For after they have finished singing for the first and last time, their strength is exhausted and their faces are blackened and their eyes are darkened, because of the brilliance of the splendor of the King. Metatron, the chief angel, says to the newly created angels, \"The Throne of Glory is glis tening!\" Immediately, the angels fall silent and hasten into the river of fire. There the angels meet their end in the same fiery stream from which they were created, and others are created to take their place. Other angels are consumed by fire that goes forth from God's little finger, as it is said. Fire is His vanguard, burning His foes on every side (Ps. 97:3). Why are the angels destroyed? Some say it is because they did not sing the hymns of the celestial liturgy in perfect unison, or do not utter their prayers in the proper order. Others say it is so that the angels will not hear the sound of the speech of God and the explicit Name of God that Metatron utters at that time. But the River of Fire can restore as well as destroy. This river serves as the heavenly mikveh, the ritual bath in which all souls are immersed. In this way all impurities are burned up, while all that is pure passes through unscathed.",

      "content": "The creatures of the upper world and the creatures of the lower world were created at the same instant. But the creatures of the upper world, who hold up the Throne of Glory, are nourished by the splendor of the Shekhinah, while the creatures of the lower world must labor for their nourishment. There are four heavenly creatures, facing the four winds. Each one is as large as the whole world. Each one has four faces and four wings, and every wing would cover the world. Clothed in fire and wrapped in a garment of flame, these heavenly beasts stand laden, day and night, in trembling and terror, for the Divine Chariot is above them, and the Throne of Glory upon their heads, and rivers of fire pass between them. God says to them, \"Exalt yourselves. It is proper that those who bear up My throne should make yourselves strong. May the hour be blessed in which I created you. May the planet be exalted under which I formed you. For you are precious vessels I have prepared and completed.\" So the living creatures strengthen and hallow and purify themselves. Each one binds thousands of crowns on its head. And they stand in holiness and sing songs and hymns with one voice, one mind, and one melody. One of the living creatures leads the heavenly hosts in the morning prayers. This creature stands in the center of the firmament and says, \"Bless you the blessed God!\" On its forehead is engraved its name, Israel, and the words, \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord alone.\" Other heavenly creatures, all consisting of fire, ascend to the Throne of Glory and stand beneath the legs of the Throne of Glory, each with four faces and four wings. The King, the living and eternal God, dwells above them. Drawing on Ezekiel s Vision (Ezek. 1:1-28), rabbinic and kabbalistic sources refer to the hayyot, the living creatures (also known as the heavenly creatures), who are said to hold up God's Throne of Glory: Above the expanse over their heads was the semblance of a throne (Ez. 1:26). A description of these creatures is found in Ezekiel 1:13-14: Such then was the appearance of the creatures. With them was something that looked like burning coals of fire. This fire, suggestive of torches, kept moving about among the creatures ; the fire had a radiance, and lightning issued from the fire. Dashing to and fro among the creatures was something that looked like flares. Clearly, traditions concerning these heavenly creatures are the purest form of myth. The identification of these heavenly creatures with lightning also underscores the mythic ties to natural events. These creatures are unique to heaven, but they are not like any of the categories of the angels. They are, instead, another kind of fiery creature. References to these creatures are often found in the hymns of the Hekhalot texts. The name of the living creature (hayah) who leads the heavenly hosts is Israel, and the words of the Shema, the central prayer of Judaism, taken from Deuteronomy 6:4, are inscribed on its forehead. The portion of the daily liturgy that the celestial beast leads is called the Barekhu. See \"The Living Creatures,\" p. 159. A parallel is found in Sefer ha-Komah, where the precious jewel in the center of God's crown is described as having the words, \"Israel, My people; Israel, My people, is Mine.\"",

After Adam sinned, the souls attached to Adam's soul descended into evil. However, some of the other souls that were originally part of Adam's soul split off, for Adam's soul originally included six hundred thousand \"old souls.\" But when Adam sinned these souls broke into six hundred thousand soul-roots. Ever since, these souls have been reincarnated in this world, so they can rectify Adam's sin. However, some say that before Adam was fully created, souls of different people were to be found in different parts of his body, and when Adam decided to eat from the Tree of Knowledge, elevated souls flew away from him. Then there are others who say that there were also new souls in Adam's soul, which had never come into the world. These souls were not revealed to Adam, and after he died, these new souls became separated from him. They now issue forth from the Tree of Life. Many angels are produced above to protect these holy souls from harm. In this way a multitude of these living souls are generated, which are drawn down to those worthy of them.

      "commentary": "This myth explains the traditions behind the concept of a person seeking their bashert or destined one. Here it is understood that the one who is sought is actually the other half of a person's soul, with whom he or she was once united in paradise. For more on the concept of bashert see \"God Makes Matches,\" p. 66. Hie sixteenth century kabbalists of Safed included reincarnation or gilgul among their basic principles, and it remains a key principle among Sephardic Jews, in particular, to this day. The Ari believed that he was the reincarnation of Rabbi Akiba. For more on the subject of sparks of soul, see \"Adam's Soul,\" p. 162. The Torah is said to contain God,000 letters, one for each one of the God,000 souls present at Mount Sinai. Commenting on this. Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav said, \"I cannot sleep. Before I fall asleep, all God,000 letters of the Torah come and stand before me\" (Sihot ha-Ran 176). According to Rabbi Moshe Hayim Luzzatto, known as Ramhal, there are God,000 heavenly souls, which are the roots of all the souls of Israel. Each soul consists of an upper part that remains in heaven and a lower counterpart that inhabits a human body ( Adir ba-Marom). Rabbi Menashe ben Israel finds the presence of the souls at Mount Sinai attested for by the verse, I make this covenant to those who are standing here, and with those who are not here with us today (Deut. 29:14). In this context the word \"standing\" is used in the sense of existing. Thus those who are standing here refers not only to the souls of the living, but to the unborn souls of future generations as well. They too were present at Sinai to receive the Torah. In this way, the souls of all Jewish generations received the Torah at Mount Sinai at the same time ( Nishmat Hayim 2:16). See \"The Giving of the Torah,\" p. 270. Rabbi Dov Ber offers a unique interpretation of the origin of souls. He states that each soul is a tiny particle of the Shekhinah, like a drop in the ocean (Maggid Devarav leYa'akov 66.)",

From this we learn that all souls are the fruit of the Holy One, blessed be He. This Tree of Souls produces all the souls that have ever existed, or will ever exist. And when the last soul descends, the world as we know it will come to an end. Rabbinic and kabbalistic texts speculate that the origin of souls is somewhere in heaven.

      "content": "The souls of all those who have not yet been bom are kept in the Gw/, the Treasury of Souls, also known as the Chamber of Creation. There each soul waits its turn to be bom. When the time comes for it to descend into this world, an angel is issued along with it, who accompanies it. It is said that sparrows can see the souls descend, and that is the source of their song. As soon as the soul leaves the Gw/, it divests itself of its heavenly garment, and is clothed in a garment of flesh and blood. Where is the Treasury of Souls? In the highest heaven, known as Aravot, where there are many treasuries, each of them guarded by angels, including the Treasury of Rain, the Treasury of Ice and Snow, the Treasury of Clouds, the Treasury of Peace, the Treasury of Blessing, and the Treasury of the Dew with which God will revive the dead. The Gw/ is found near the Throne of Glory, and a dazzling brilliant light emanates from the many souls in repose there. Those souls are in their pristine state, untainted by existence in this world. Some of them flicker like a small candle and some shine like a torch, and there are some whose radiance rivals the sun. When the time comes for the soul to leave this world, the Angel of Death strips off the worldly garment, and at the same instant the soul is clothed in the holy garment that was stripped away when it descended to this world. Then the soul delights in having been stripped of its worldly body and in having its original garment restored. And the souls who have departed from their earthly bodies return to that same treasury, and fly before the Throne of Glory in the presence of God. And when the time comes for a human to be bom, the angel Gabriel puts his hand into the Treasury of Souls and takes out the first soul that comes into his hand. If the person is fortunate, a great soul comes into Gabriel's hand; if not a spark of a soul inhabits the body. It is said about the soul of the Ba'al Shem Tov that its radiance shone from one end of the universe to the other. Each time the angel Gabriel sought to bring this soul down to this world, Satan would storm into heaven and protest. In this way, the brightest of souls remained in heaven for thousands of years, but at last it descended and the Ba'al Shem Tov was bom. There are those who say that the Gw/ contains an infinite number of souls, while others insist there is only a finite number of souls in it, and that the Messiah will not come until the Gw/ has been emptied of every soul. Others say that from the day the Temple was destroyed, no more souls entered the Gw/, and when it has been emptied of all the remaining souls, the Messiah will come. And when the last soul has descended and the Gw/ is empty, the first infant to be bom without a soul, bom dead as such an infant must be, will herald the death of the world and so is called the final sign. Then all of the sparrows will grow silent, and the world, as we know it, will end, and the End of Days will begin. There is general agreement in rabbinic lore that the souls of the unborn are kept in a storehouse or Treasury of Souls. In B. Avodah Zarah 5a, Resh Lakish, an important talmudic sage, is quoted as saying, \"The Messiah will only come when all the souls destined to inhabit earthly bodies have been exhausted.\" Rashi, commenting on this, says that \"There is a treasure house called the Gw/, and at the time of Creation all souls destined to be bom were formed and placed there.\" This treasure house is said to contain souls created since the six days of Creation, which are being saved for bodies yet to be created. It is also described in B. Yevamot 63b as located behind the heavenly curtain known as the Pargod, where \"there are spirits and souls created since the six days of Creation that are intended for bodies yet to be created.\"",

      "title": "The Path Of The Soul In The Garden Of Eden",
      "content": "Some say that when the righteous leave this world, three companies of angels join them. These angels go ahead of the righteous, leading them to the Garden of Eden. And when the soul of a Tzaddik leaves his body, the archangel Michael goes out to meet it, saying, \"May you come in peace.\" Others say that there is a column through which the soul of a person who has passed away travels from the lower Garden of Eden to the higher Garden. By means of this column, the soul rises from one world to another, from one year to another, and from soul to soul. This is called \"the column of service and fear of heaven.\" Still others say that the souls of the righteous ascend the Tree of Life into heaven, to the celestial Garden of Eden. That garden is planted on a source of living water, and the size of the garden is a thousand years' journey. The reward awaiting the righteous when they take leave of this world is the Olam ha-Ba , the World to Come. This is also identified in rabbinic texts as Gan Eden , the Garden of Eden. This myth describes what occurs when a righteous person dies and goes to receive his heavenly reward. The second teaching, that of the \"column of service and fear of heaven,\" is attributed to the Ba'al Shem Tov. It resolves the problem of the link between the earthly Gan Eden and the heavenly one. It also explains how it is possible for a soul to ascend to higher levels of Paradise. The description of moving \"from soul to soul\" may be a reference to gilgul, the transmigration of souls, i.e., reincarnation. Hasidic theory also includes the possibility of the combining of sparks of souls, and moving \"from soul to soul\" might also be referring to this.",

      "content": "There is a field where wondrous trees grow. Its splendor cannot be described. The trees and grass are holy souls that grow there. There are also many naked souls that stray beyond its borders and await repair. For even the greatest soul has difficulty reentering that field once it has departed. And all of those exiled souls call for the field master who will engage himself in tikkun, so that those souls can be repaired. Whoever takes on that task must be steadfast and courageous. There is one such man who can only complete this task through his own death. He must endure many afflictions, but in the end he will accomplish the work of the field and prevail.",
      "commentary": "This is an allegory of Rabbi Nachman's about the meaning of exile from the Garden of Eden, and about the tikkun, or repair, of souls. The field of souls is the Garden of Eden, or Paradise (which blur together in the rabbinic concept of Gan Eden), where souls originate as well as find eternal rest. But those who stray from there, exiled into the fallen world, eventually find themselves naked and in need of repair by the field master. This figure represents the Tzaddik in general and Messiah ben Joseph in particular. The role of Messiah ben Joseph is to pave the way for the arrival of Messiah ben David, the heavenly Messiah, who will initiate the End of Days. It is the fate of Messiah ben Joseph to die while engaged in his messianic task. See \"The Two Messiahs,\" p. 517. Thus Rabbi Nachman's allegory is essentially a reaffirmation of the need to long and pray for the coming of the Messiah, who will repair all souls in need of repair.",

      "content": "After death a man's soul undergoes up to four transformations. First, it crosses the sea. And if the soul falls there, it enters the body of a fish. And if that fish is caught, and someone cooks and eats that fish after saying the proper blessing, that soul is spared its suffering and ascends to the Garden of Eden. Then there are the souls that cross the ocean and pass above the trees. If the soul falls and enters a fruit-bearing tree, and if those fruits are later picked and blessings pronounced on them, that soul also enters the Garden of Eden, its sufferings at an end.",
      "commentary": "So too are there souls that pass over the crops, such as wheat. If the soul enters the wheat and bread is made of it, and the blessings are said over it, that soul is also saved. But if the soul enters crops that are eaten by animals, it remains in sorrow. For if an animal eats the crops containing this soul, it enters the animal. It suffers there until the animal is slaughtered and blessings are made over the food. And that is the soul's last chance of being saved from its suffering. For if it is not saved, it will continue to suffer until the End of Days. But if it is saved, its soul will be saved from great suffering, and it will make its home in the Garden of Eden. Otherwise it will be condemned to wait until the footsteps of the Messiah are heard. Beginning with the Safed kabbalists in the sixteenth century, the concept of metempsychosis, the transmigration of souls, becomes a central principle in Judaism known as gilgul. The ultimate goal of the soul, from this perspective, is to be freed from the cycle of reincarnation, much as the goal in Hinduism is to achieve Nirvana and be freed from any further rebirths. The fate of the soul as outlined here involves great suffering. And an even worse punishment awaits those souls whose sins were so great that avenging angels chase them from one place to the next. When such a wandering spirit takes possession of a living person, it is known as a dybbuk. See, for example, \"The Widow of Safed,\" p. 228. For an example of the freeing of a soul from gilgul , see \"The Sabbath Fish,\" in Gabriel's Palace, pp. 233-234. See also S. Ansky's folk drama. The Dybbuk. Sefer ha-Likutim , edited by Binyamin ha-Levi and Elisha Vestali, p. 175, based on teachings of Hayim Vital, suggests that the righteous may go through gilgul for a thousand generations, while the unjust do so for only three. This is because those who were learned in Torah are said to be protected from entering Gehenna, where sins are purified through the punishments of hell. Yet even the righteous accumulate sins that need to be cleansed, so the process of gilgul serves to purify their souls. But the unjust enter hell after only three generations and have their sins cleansed there.",

      "content": "When Adam was old, he called his son Seth to him and said: \"Hear these words, my son. All that I am going to tell you is true. One day, not long after your mother and I had been expelled from Paradise, as we finished our prayers, I had a vision: I saw a chariot like the wind and its wheels were fiery. Before I knew it, I was caught up into Paradise. There I saw the Lord seated on a mighty throne, and the flames cast from His face could not be endured. Many thousands of angels were there, on each side of the chariot. I was seized with terror, and I bowed down before God, and God said, 'Because you transgressed My commandment, the time has come for you to die.' When I heard these words, I fell prone and said, 'Master of the Universe! Do not cast me out of your presence, I whom You shaped out of dust. Do not banish what You Yourself nourished.' \"God said, 'Fear not, because of your love of knowledge, your seed will always be with Me.' And when I heard these words, I prostrated myself before God and said, 'You are the eternal and supreme God. You are the true Light shining above all lights. May it be Your will to bestow abundance on the race of men.' \"Then, as soon as I finished speaking, the angel Michael seized my hand and brought me out of Paradise. He touched the waters surrounding Paradise with his rod, and they froze in place. And Michael and I crossed over the frozen waters, and led me back to this world. That is when the vision came to an end. Nor did I die on that day.\"",
      "commentary": "This myth about Adam is a good example of a Merkavah myth. Adam not only has a vision of the Divine Chariot, as does Ezekiel, but he is taken up into heaven in it, as later happened to Enoch and Elijah, and he has a heavenly vision. Note that the vision takes place not long after Adam's expulsion from Eden. God tells him of his impending doom, but then spares him, and reveals that he will be the first of a long line. This account of Adam's vision makes Adam the first one to take such a heavenly journey. But while Enoch's journey into Paradise is well known, this myth about Adam, found in Vita Adae et Evae, is somewhat obscure. In fact, mythic accounts of such heavenly journeys can be found for Adam, Enoch, the patriarchs, and Moses, as well as several of the rabbinic sages.",

      "content": "When the knife touched Isaac's throat, his soul flew from him. While his body lay on the stone altar, his soul ascended on high, rising up through the palaces of heaven. And the angels on high brought Isaac's soul to the celestial academy of Shem and Eber. There he remained for three years, studying the Torah, for in this way Isaac was rewarded for all he had suffered when he was about to be slain.",
      "commentary": "So too were all the Treasuries of Heaven opened to Isaac: the celestial Temple, which has existed there since the time of Creation, the Chambers of the Chariot, and all of the palaces of heaven; all the Treasuries of Ice and Snow, as well as the Treasury of Prayers, and the Treasury of Souls. There Isaac saw how he had descended from the seed of Adam. So too was he permitted to see the future generations that would arise from the seed of Abraham. Even the End of Days was revealed, for no mystery of heaven was deemed too secret for the pure soul of Isaac. There, too, Isaac found his own face on the curtain of God known as the Pargod. During all this time Abraham remained frozen in place, the knife in his upraised hand. But to him it seemed but a single breath. Then the angel spoke: \"Lay not your hand upon the lad,\" and at that instant Isaac's soul returned to his body. And when Isaac found that his soul had been restored to him, he exclaimed: \"Blessed is He who quickens the dead!\" And when Abraham unbound him, Isaac arose, seeing the world as if for the first time, as if he had been reborn. Although it is clearly stated in Genesis 22:12 that the angel of the Lord commanded Abraham not to raise his hand against Isaac, this late midrash, which may well echo Christian influence, asserts that Abraham did in fact slay Isaac, and that Isaac's soul ascended to Paradise, where he studied in the academy of Shem and Eber. The basis of this midrash is the conclusion of the Akedah episode of the binding of Isaac, where it is Abraham alone who returns to his servants, and no mention is made of Isaac (Gen. 22:19). The themes of dying and resurrection here echo the Christian belief in the death and resurrection of Jesus. The similarity of the three days after the death of Jesus when the resurrection takes place, and the three years in this midrash about Isaac underscores the parallel. This legend about the ascent of Isaac is linked to the Resurrection of the Dead by adding that when Isaac arose, \"He knew that in this way the dead would come back to life in the future, whereupon he began to recite, 'Blessed are You, O Lord, who quickens the dead'\" (Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 31). For further discussion of the legends of the Akedah , the Binding of Isaac, see The Last Trial by Shalom Spiegel. The academy of Shem and Eber is often referred to in the Midrash. Abraham is said to have told Sarah that he was taking Isaac to study there at the time he set off for Mount Moriah (Sefer ha-Yashar 43a-44b). While this academy may once have been on earth, in most rabbinic legends it is identified as the academy on high. Therefore Isaac's ascent to Paradise to study in this academy verifies Abraham's statement to Sarah, affirming his honesty. The origin of this legend is the identification of the tents of Shem in Genesis 9:27 with a Beit Midrash or House of Study, which evolved in midrashic literature into an academy led by Shem and his great-grandson Eber. Later legends identify the academy as a heavenly one, where the greatest sages study. There also is a strong identification of prophecy with Shem, who was said to have had the gift of prophecy. Note that in the midrash this \"academy\" existed long before the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai, underscoring the rabbinic belief of the pre-existence of the Torah. This myth finds it fullest form in \"The Akedah,\" a medieval piyyut by Ephraim ben Jacob of Bonn.",

      "content": "When the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha had set out from Gilgal. Elijah said to Elisha, \"Stay here, for the Lord has sent me on to Bethel.\" \"As the Lord lives and as you live,\" said Elisha, \"I will not leave you.\" So they went down to Bethel. Disciples of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him. Do you know that the Lord will take your master away from you today?\" He replied, \"I know it, too; be silent.\" Then Elijah said to him, \"Elisha, stay here, for the Lord has sent me on to Jericho.\" \"As the Lord lives and as you live,\" said Elisha, \"I will not leave you.\" So they went on to Jericho. The disciples of the prophets who were at Jericho came over to Elisha and said to him, \"Do you know that the Lord will take your master away from you today?\" He replied, \"I know it, too; be silent.\" Elijah said to him, \"Stay here, for the Lord has sent me on to the Jordan.\" \"As the Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you,\" he said, and the two of them went on. Fifty men of the disciples of the prophets followed and stood by at a distance from them as the two stopped at the Jordan. Thereupon Elijah took his mantle and, rolling it up, he struck the water; it divided to the right and left, so that the two of them crossed over on dry land. As they were crossing, Elijah said to Elisha, \"Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?\" Elisha answered, \"Let a double portion of your spirit pass on to me.\" \"You have asked a difficult thing,\" he said. \"If you see me as I am being taken from you, this will be granted to you; if not, it will not.\" As they kept on walking and talking, a fiery chariot with fiery horses suddenly appeared and separated one from the other; and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind. Elisha saw it, and he cried out, \"Oh, father, father! Israel's chariots and horsemen!\" When he could no longer see him, he grasped his garments and rent them in two. The ascent of Elijah is the primary model for all subsequent accounts of heavenly journeys. This even includes the tradition about Enoch having been taken up into heaven in a fiery chariot, based on the interpretations of Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, for God took him (Gen. 5:24). The talmudic tale of the four who entered Pardes (B. Hagigah 14b) is also indebted to the ascent imagery of this biblical account. See \"The Four Who Entered Paradise,\" following. As important as is the ascent of Elijah, equally important is the loyalty of Elisha, demonstrated here, and the transfer of Elijah's mantle to his disciple.",

      "content": "Four sages entered Paradise — Ben Azzai, Ben Zoma, Aher, and Rabbi Akiba. Ben Azzai looked and died. Ben Zoma looked and lost his mind. Aher cut himself off from his fathers and became an apostate. Only Rabbi Akiba entered and departed in peace. It is said that when Ben Azzai passed through the palaces of heaven and saw with his own eyes the glory of the celestial palace, his body could not endure it, and his soul could not tear itself away, for he felt that he had returned to his true home at last. And that is how he took leave of this world. About Aher it is said that when he ascended on high, he reached the realm of the angel Metatron, whom he saw seated on a throne. In great confusion he cried out \"There are — God forbid — two powers in heaven!\" and from that moment he lost his faith. Then God commanded Metatron to be lashed sixty times with a fiery whip for not showing Aher that he was wrong. In those days Ben Zoma was seen walking down a road by a rabbi and his students. They greeted him, but Ben Zoma did not respond. Finally the rabbi asked, \"Where have you been, Ben Zoma?\" And Ben Zoma replied: \"I was contemplating the Mysteries of Creation. I learned that between the upper waters and the lower waters there are but three finger-breadths.\" Hearing this, the rabbi said to his students: \"Ben Zoma is gone.\" Nor did Ben Zoma live long after that. When Rabbi Akiba ascended to heaven, he made signs at the entrance of heaven so that he could find his way back. When he arrived at the Pargod, the celestial curtain, the angels of destruction came out to injure him. Then a heavenly voice issued from beneath the throne of glory, which said, \"Leave this elder alone. He is worthy of gazing at My glory.\" And there, in the highest heaven, before the Throne of Glory, God's holy and secret Name was revealed to him. Four sages entered Paradise. But only Rabbi Akiba ascended on high, passed through the palaces of heaven, and descended in peace. This brief, ambiguous legend about the four sages who entered Pardes is one of the central mystical tales in the Jewish tradition. It became the focus of opposing traditions — those who saw it as the model for mystical contemplation and heavenly ascent, as found in the Hekhalot texts, and those who saw in its conclusion, in which three of the four greatest talmudic sages are somehow harmed, a warning that such contemplation and/or ascent was gravely dangerous and that the study of mystical texts should be limited to those who were well-grounded. But the tale of the four who entered Paradise (for this is how it was commonly understood) impressed others in an entirely different way. For this legend also became an entry into the mysteries of Pardes by an esoteric Jewish sect, who sought, by engaging in mystical contemplation, to discover the means to enter Pardes , which represented the heavenly Paradise. This is a form of contemplation of Ma'aseh Merkavah , or of the Mysteries of the Chariot, and such mystical ascent is paradoxically identified as a descent. The writings produced by this sect are called Hekhalot texts, since they describe travels through the palaces (Hekhalot) of heaven. They were written either to record their mystical experiences or to prepare a guidebook for ascent. To a large extent, the very ambiguity of the legend of the four sages is the reason for its primacy. Many have wondered what Ben Azzai saw that caused him to lose his life, what Ben Zoma saw that caused him to lose his mind, and what Elisha ben Abuyah (Aher) saw that caused him to \"cut the shoots,\" i.e., become an apostate. There are clues in the Talmud concerning the fates of Ben Zoma and Aher , while the clues about Ben Azzai are found in Leviticus Rabbah and Song of Songs Rabbah, as noted. Ben Azzai's mysterious death has been linked to the mystical tradition of those who give up their souls without reservation during a mystical experience. This is equivalent to dying by the Kiss of the Shekhinah, as Moses did. Gershom Scholem speculates that the Hekhalot sect actively engaged in techniques to induce mystical experiences/ including the use of yogalike positions/ and the singing of rhythmical hymns in unison for long periods of time. Standard Jewish practices of purification were also used, including the mikveh (ritual bath), fasting, and extensive prayer. Emphasis was also placed on the power of the word — on prayers, on amulets containing invocations, and, above all, the secret pronunciation of the Divine Name. One of the unanswered questions about the heavenly ascent of the four sages is whether it was a bodily ascent or a soul ascent. Ben Zoma, for example, indicates that he knows exactly how much space exists between the upper waters and the lower waters. Did he gain this knowledge firsthand, by ascending to that place? An indication of the answer is found in Midrash Tehillim 19:4, where Rabbi Samuel bar Abba is quoted as having said, \"I know the lanes of heaven as well as the lanes of Nehardea\" (a city in Babylonia, the seat of a rabbinic academy). This midrash asks if Samuel meant that he had actually gone up into the firmament. The answer is no — rather, laboring at Torah's wisdom he learned from it what is in the firmament. Likewise, Rabbi Hoshaiah is quoted as saying, \"Even as there is an empty space between the lower waters and the firmament, so there is an empty space between the upper waters and the firmament.\" The midrash again asks if Rabbi Hoshaiah meant that he had actually gone up into the upper heavens? The answer is no— by laboring at Torah's wisdom, he learned from it all that is in the upper heavens. An interesting oral variant of the myth of the four who entered Paradise is IFA 13901. The four rabbis in this Moroccan story find the opportunity to go to heaven on Sukkot, when the sky opens for an instant, and an angel invites them to study kabbalah in Paradise. The fact that the four were invited to make this journey means their greatness had been recognized in Heaven, and that is why they were able to make such a blessed journey.",

      "content": "One of the Roman emperors called in ten of the finest sages and demanded to study the Torah with them. They began at the beginning of Genesis, and all went well until they reached the passage in Exodus that reads. He who kidnaps a man , whether he has sold him or is still holding him, shall be put to death (Exod. 21: 16). When he read this, the Emperor remembered how Joseph's brothers had sold him into slavery. Yet they had not been punished by death, as the law required. The Emperor asked the sages if this ruling applied to Joseph's brothers, and they agreed that it did. Then he demanded that the law r be fulfilled and the executions carried out. The sages tried to explain that Joseph's brothers had died long ago. The Emperor told them that he knew that the brothers could no longer be punished. But in that case, the punishment must be carried out on those who represented Joseph's brothers in that age. And he pointed to each of the ten sages and told them that surely none represented the leaders of the tribes of Israel more than they did. Then the Emperor signed a decree commanding that the ten sages be put to death, among them Rabbi Akiba, Rabbi Ishmael, Rabbi Hananiah ben Teradion, and seven other of the greatest sages who ever lived. All of the sages were placed in a cell together, so that none might escape before the execution was carried out. There in that cell they turned to Rabbi Ishmael and begged him to use the power of the Name to overturn the Emperor's decree, for they knew that he alone could do it. Rabbi Ishmael told them that he could indeed overturn the decree, but first they must find out if it was solely that of the Emperor, or if in condemning them the Emperor was carrying out a decree of the Holy One, blessed be He. Then Rabbi Ishmael put on his tallit and tefillin and chanted a long prayer. And as he prayed, his soul ascended to the sixth heaven, where the angel Gabriel greeted him and asked to know why he had come there. Rabbi Ishmael told him of the Emperor's decree, and that he had ascended to learn if it were a Divine decree or not. Then Gabriel swore that he had heard the decree pronounced from behind the Pargod, the heavenly curtain. But he told Rabbi Ishmael not to mourn, for the ten sages would shortly be reunited in Paradise. Meanwhile their martyrdom would free the world from the evil that had entered it when Joseph's brothers sold him into slavery. And when that terrible sin had been lifted from the world, one of the chains that held back the Messiah would be broken, and the days of the Messiah would be that much closer. Rabbi Ishmael was greatly comforted to learn this and accepted his fate at once. Then he and the angel Gabriel took their leave of each other, and Rabbi Ishmael returned to this world. When he opened his eyes. Rabbi Ishmael saw that all of the other sages had gathered around him, waiting for his soul to return from on high. He told them at once all he had learned from the lips of the angel Gabriel. And when the other sages learned that they had been chosen to lift the sin of Joseph's brothers from the world, and to break one of the chains of the Messiah, they embraced their destiny. And one by one they went bravely to their deaths.",
      "commentary": "While most texts describing heavenly journeys make the ascent the focus of the tale, \"Rabbi Ishmael's Ascent\" is a portion of a longer midrashic narrative known as \"The Legend of the Ten Martyrs.\" Here ten of the most famous Jewish martyrs, including Rabbi Akiba and Rabbi Ishmael, are linked as victims of the same evil decree, even though historically they did not all live at the same time. Rabbi Ishmael then undertakes an ascent into Paradise to discover if this is actually a heavenly decree or not. If not, he has it within his power to overthrow the Emperor's decree by drawing on the power of God's Name. So far the tale reads like a fairy tale. If it had followed this pattern. Rabbi Ishmael would have learned that it was not a heavenly decree, and on his return he would have defeated the Emperor, saving himself and his fellow sages. But this account has fused the Hekhalot-type tale of ascent with the accounts of the deaths of these great sages culled from rabbinic sources, primarily from the Tal-",

      "title": "The Entrance Of The Sixth Heavenly Palace",
      "content": "Those who ascend on high must beware at the entrance of the sixth hekhal , the sixth heavenly palace. It appears as if it were engulfed by a sea of waves, but anyone who cries out, \"Water, water!\" is in grave danger. For there is not even a drop of water, only the radiance of pure marble stones, more awe-inspiring than water. Furthermore, the doorkeepers of the sixth palace destroy all those who arrive there without permission. Those warlike doorkeepers, the angels Dumiel and Kaspiel, are taller than mountains, and sharper than peaks. Their bows are strung and stand before them; their swords are sharpened and in their hands. Lightning issues forth from their eyes, and spider webs of fire from their nostrils, and torches of fiery coals from their mouths. And they are equipped with helmets and coats of mail, and javelins and spears are hung upon their muscles. These gatekeepers would destroy all those who arrive there without permission. It is said of Ben Azzai that he reached the entrance of the sixth heavenly palace and saw the radiance of the light of the pure marble stones. He called out, \"Water, water,\" and in a wink the doorkeeper who guards that gate cut off his head. This became a sign for all generations, not to err at the entrance of the sixth hekhal Only those who are protected by the angel Lumiel by reason of righteousness will be able to pass beyond the doorkeeper of the sixth palace. For the angel bears a gift for those who deserve it. It is not a gift of silver and not a gift of gold, but it grants the one who \"descends\" to the Merkavah the privilege that he should not be questioned, not in the first palace and not in the second, not in the third palace and not in the fourth, and not in the fifth palace or the sixth, and not in the seventh. But Lumiel shows the seal to the proper angels, and the one who ascends is able to go on to the next gate. Of all the dangers of trying to ascend to Paradise (paradoxically known as \"descending to the Merkavah \"), the greatest lurks at the entrance of the sixth gate. This gate is guarded by the dangerous angels Dumiel (Divine silence) and Kaspiel (Divine wrath). In Hekhalot Rabbati the death of Ben Azzai recorded in B. Hagigah 14b is recounted as having taken place at the sixth gate, when the doorkeeper cut off his head. (Other texts offer different explanations, most of them less violent.) The secret to passing beyond the gate of the sixth heaven and thereby being able to enter the seventh heaven, Aravot, is held by the angel Lumiel, who bears a seal that makes it possible to pass beyond all of the doorkeepers without being questioned. This seal is only available to the very righteous. This would suggest that of the four sages who entered Paradise, as recounted in B. Hagigah 14b, only Rabbi Akiba, who entered and departed in peace, was righteous enough to deserve this seal. Hekhalot Rabbati asks: \"What is it like to know the secret of the Merkavah ? It is like having a ladder in one's house and being able to go up and down at will.\" Gershom Scholem has found an echo of the these heavenly gatekeepers in Kafka's famous parable, \"Before the Law.\" See this story on p. 179. See \"The Four Who Entered Paradise,\" p. 173.",

      "number": 212,
      "title": "Before The Law",
      "content": "Before the Law stands a man guarding the door. To this doorkeeper comes a man from the country who asks to be admitted to the Law. But the doorkeeper says that he cannot grant him entry. The man thinks about it and asks if, in that case, he will be permitted to enter later. \"Possibly,\" says the doorkeeper, \"but not now.\" As the gateway to the Law is, as always, open, and the doorkeeper steps aside, the man stoops to look within. When the doorkeeper sees this, he laughs and says, \"If it tempts you that much, just try to get in. But be aware that I am mighty. And I am only the lowliest doorkeeper. From hall to hall there are doorkeepers, each mightier than the one before. Even I can no longer bear the sight of the third of these.\" The man from the country has not expected such difficulties. Surely, he thinks, the Law ought to be accessible to everybody, always, but now as he looks more carefully at the doorkeeper, with his big pointed nose and long, thin, black Tatar beard, he decides he'd rather wait for permission to enter. The doorkeeper gives him a stool and has him sit down beside the door. There he sits for days and for years. He often tries to be admitted, and wearies the doorkeeper with his pleas. The doorkeeper frequently questions him, asks him about where he comes from and many other things, but they are distant inquiries, the sort great men make, and in the end he always says that he cannot let him in yet. The man, who has equipped himself for his journey with many things, employs everything, however valuable, to bribe the doorkeeper. He takes it all, saying however, \"I accept this only so you won't think you've failed to do anything.\" All these long years the man watches the doorkeeper unceasingly. He forgets the other doorkeepers, and this first one seems to be the only obstacle between him and the Law. He curses his miserable luck, at first recklessly and loudly; later, as he grows old, he only grumbles to himself. He becomes childish, and since his years of scrutiny of the doorkeeper have enabled him to recognize even the fleas in his fur collar, he asks even the fleas to help change the doorkeeper's mind. Finally his eyes grow feeble, and he doesn't know if it's really getting darker around him or if his eyes are only tricking him. But in the darkness he now observes an inextinguishable radiance streaming out of the door of the Law. Now he will not live much longer. Before he dies all he has been through converges in his mind into one question that he has never yet asked the doorkeeper. He signals to him, as he can no longer raise his stiffening body. The doorkeeper has to bend down low to him, as their difference in size has altered, much to the man's disadvantage. \"What do you want to know now?\" asks the doorkeeper. \"There's no satisfying you.\" \"Everyone struggles to reach the Law,\" says the man. \"How can it be that in all these years no one but me has asked to get in?\" The doorkeeper recognizes that the man's life is almost over and, because his hearing is failing, he roars at him, \"No one else could be allowed in here. This entrance was intended only for you. I am now going to close it.\" This famous parable by Kafka from The Trial can be read as a religious allegory or as an allegory of human justice. Although it is generally thought of more in terms of the latter, it has the distinct elements of a religious allegory. The key image is that \"of an inextinguishable radiance streaming out of the door of the Law.\" This clearly suggests the eternal nature of the Law, which, of course, draws this eternal quality from God. This shifts the focus of the parable from human justice to the need for divine justice, and hints at the remoteness of God. The doorkeeper guarding the gate to the Law is reminiscent of the angel placed at the gate of the Garden of Eden, with the flaming sword that turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life (Gen. 3:24). Also echoed is the popular Christian conception of St. Peter serving as the doorkeeper at the Gates of Heaven. Gershom Scholem has said that there are three pillars of Jewish mystical thought: the Bible, the Zohar, and the writings of Kafka. Thus he viewed Kafka's writings, which have been interpreted in a multitude of ways, as mystical texts. Scholem pointed out parallels between \"Before the Law\" and passages in the Hekhalot texts about angels guarding the gates of the palaces of heaven. For a description of these angels, see \"The Entrance of the Sixth Heavenly Palace,\" p. 178. Compare this description with Kafka's description of the doorkeeper in \"Before the Law.\" The parallels are striking, but since this Hekhalot text was little known during Kafka's lifetime, it is not likely that he had direct knowledge of it. Moshe Idel also identifies the quest in this tale as the remnant of a mystical one. See Kabbalah: New Perspectives, p. 271. Another perspective is suggested by Zohar 1:7b: Open the gates of righteousness for me — This is the gateway to the Lord (Ps. 68:19-20). Assuredly, without entering through that gate one will never gain access to the most high King. Imagine a king greatly exalted who screens himself from the common view behind gate upon gate, and at the end, one special gate, locked and barred. Said the king: \"He who wishes to enter into my presence must first of all pass through that gate.\" Another parallel is found in Ibn Gabirol's eleventh century treatise. The Book of the Selection of Pearls (ch. 8): \"The following laconic observations are said to have been addressed to a king, by one who stood by the gate of the royal palace, but who failed to obtain access. First: Necessity and hope prompted me to approach your throne. Second: My dire distress admits of no delay. Third: My disappointment would gratify the malice of my enemies. Fourth: Your acquiescence would confer advantages, and even your refusal would relieve me from anxiety and suspense.\" Max Brod, Kafka's close friend and biographer, comments about this parable: \"Kafka's deeply ironic legend 'Before the Law' is not the reminiscence or retelling of this ancient lore, as it would seem at first glance, but an original creation drawn deeply from his archaic soul. It is yet another proof of his profound roots in Judaism, whose potency and creative images rose to new activities in his unconscious.\" ( Johannes Reuchlin und sein Kampf, Stuttgart: 1965, pp. 274-275). Of course, \"Before the Law\" can also be read as a personal statement of the kind of obstruction Kafka experienced at the hands of his father. The role of the gatekeeper can also be identified with Kafka's mother, for Kafka gave^ds mother the epic letter he wrote to his father, to pass on to him, but she decided not to do so. In such a reading Kafka's father represents the Law, the strict, godlike figure. See Kafka's Letter to His Father. Also, Kafka's parable is relevant to human justice, where, on many occasions, people have been denied justice by the very ones who were supposed to provide it for them. In doing so they perform the obstructive role of the gatekeeper, who was supposed to welcome the man from the country at the gate intended only for him, but instead prevented him from entering at all. Readers may wonder why a modem parable by Franz Kafka has been included in a book of Jewish mythology. There are several reasons for this. Kafka's fiction possesses a strong mythic element, and scholars have become increasingly aware of the strong influence on it of Jewish tradition; Kafka's writing in general, and this parable in particular, has taken on the qualities of a sacred text in our time; and there are strong parallels between this parable and traditional Jewish myths about the quest to reach God, but also a strong element of doubt in Kafka's parable that reflects the modern era. Just as the evolution of Jewish mythology did not end with the canonization of the Bible or the Talmud, and continued to flourish in the kabbalistic and hasidic era, so too it can be seen to continue in the modem era in the writings of Kafka. It also can be found in other seminal Jewish authors, such as I. L. Peretz, S. Y. Agnon, Bruno Schulz, and I. B. Singer.",

      "content": "Yozel Frandrik was a wonder child, bom in the days of the Temple. He could speak from the time he was bom. When he was still a child, he crept into the Temple and cut off the Shem ha-Meforash, the Ineffable Name of God. Then he took a knife and made a cut in his foot and put the Name inside it, and sewed it shut. At that instant he grew wings, and after that there was nothing he could not accomplish. He flew like a bird and ascended on high, until he was flying with the angels. But an angel poured water on his feet, making him impure. All at once his magic powers left him, his wings fell off, and he tumbled to the ground. He could not fly any more after that, but he never returned the Ineffable Name, and no one knows where it is to this day.",
      "commentary": "This is a highly unusual oral myth collected in Israel by the Israel Folktale Archives. It is a fantasy about a strange wonder child, Yozel Frandrik. He is said to have lived in the Temple period. In an act both daring and outrageous, he steals into the Temple and cuts off God's Name, YHVH, known as the Shem ha-Meforash. Using powers of kabbalistic wizardry, he implants the Name of God in his foot, and he immediately grows wings. Flying through the heavens, he provokes the anger of the angels, and one of them pours water on his foot, making him impure. This causes him to lose all powers and fall from heaven, just as happens to Icarus. Indeed, this myth has all the earmarks of a Jewish Icarus. Icarus, flying with wax wings created by his father, Dedalus, flew too close to the sun, causing the wings to melt and for him to plunge to his death. Yozel Frandrik also does forbidden things, in this case cutting off God's Name from the Temple, then implanting the Name in his foot, which is another desecration of the Name. Still, like Moses when he struck the rock instead of speaking to it, the magic works — the power of the Name causes Yozel to grow wings. In this case, his fall from heaven is not due to melting wings, but to an angel purposely rendering him impure, in order to sap him of his powers. This indeed is what takes place, although Yozel survives. Nor does he give the Name back. Thus he is portrayed as unrepentant to the end. David J. Halperin, in a private communication, suggests another perspective: \"To my mind, there is no doubt at all that this tale is rooted in the anti-Christian Toledot Yeshu tradition of the Middle Ages. Yozel Frandrik is none other than Jesus. His name is a corruption of 'Yeshu (ben) Pandira/ the standard rabbinic designation for Jesus. In the Toledot Yeshu tradition, Jesus sneaks into the Temple and learns the letters of God's Name from the Foundation Stone. He writes the Name on parchment, which he smuggles out of the Temple by concealing it in an incision he has made in his thigh. Later he flies up to heaven; Rabbi Judah Ish Bartota (=Judas Iscariot, presumably) flies up after him. After an inconclusive aerial dogfight between the two, Judah deliberately ejaculates his semen onto Jesus, with the result that Jesus becomes impure and falls down to earth. The parallels with 'Yozel Frandrik' seem to me overwhelming.\" In another text, Megillat Ahimaaz, a dead man is brought to life when God's Name, written on parchment, is implanted in his arm. However, such apparent life leaves the man without a soul, and unable to pronounce God's Name during prayers. It is this inability that gives him away. See \"The Young Man Without a Soul\" in Gabriel's Palace, pp. 145-148. A parallel use of the Name to bring the dead to life is found in the Ma'aseh Buck #171, where a killer is brought to life to confess his sin.",

      "content": "In the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, when I was in the community of exiles by the Chebar Canal, the heavens opened and I saw visions of God. On the fifth day of the month— it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin— the word of the Lord came to the priest Ezekiel son of Buzi, by the Chebar Canal, in the land of the Chaldeans. And the hand of the Lord came upon him there. I looked, and lo, a stormy wind came sweeping out of the north— a huge cloud and flashing fire, surrounded by a radiance; and in the center of it, in the center of the fire, a gleam as of amber. In the center of it were also the figures of four creatures. And this was their appearance: They had the figures of human beings. However, each had four faces, and each of them had four wings; the legs of each were fused into a single rigid leg, and the feet of each were like a single calf's hoof; and their sparkle was like the luster of burnished bronze. They had human hands below their wings. The four of them had their faces and their wings on their four sides. Each one's wings touched those of the other. They did not turn when they moved; each could move in the direction of any of its faces. Each of them had a human face in front; each of the four had the face of a lion on the right; each of the four had the face of an ox on the left; and each of the four had the face of an eagle at the back. Such were their faces. As for their wings, they were separated: above, each had two touching those of the others, while the other two covered its body. And each could move in the direction of any of its faces; they went wherever the spirit impelled them to go, without turning when they moved. Such then was the appearance of the creatures. With them was something that looked like burning coals of fire. This fire, suggestive of torches, kept moving about among the creatures; the fire had a radiance, and lightning issued from the fire. Dashing to and fro among the creatures was something that looked like flares. As I gazed on the creatures, I saw one wheel on the ground next to each of the four-faced creatures. As for the appearance and structure of the wheels, they gleamed like beryl. All four had the same form; the appearance and structure of each was as of two wheels cutting through each other. And when they moved, each could move in the direction of any of its four quarters; they did not veer when they moved. Their rims were tall and frightening, for the rims of all four were covered all over with eyes. And when the creatures moved forward, the wheels moved at their sides; and when the creatures were borne above the earth, the wheels were borne too. Wherever the spirit impelled them to go, they went— wherever the spirit impelled them — and the wheels were borne alongside them; for the spirit of the creatures was in the wheels. When those moved, these moved; and when those stood still, these stood still; and when those were borne above the earth, the wheels were borne alongside them — for the spirit of the creatures was in the wheels.",

      "content": "Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai and his student. Rabbi Eleazar ben Arakh, once rode through a field on their donkeys. And Rabbi Eleazar said: \"Please, rabbi, teach me something about the Mysteries of the Chariot.\" \"Surely you know that such mysteries may not be revealed to a single student, unless he is able to comprehend them on his own,\" said Rabbi Yohanan. \"Therefore you may begin the discussion, and I will decide whether to speak of such secrets.\" At that moment Rabbi Eleazar dismounted from his donkey, wrapped himself in his prayer shawl, and sat down beneath an olive tree. \"Why did you dismount?\" asked Rabbi Yohanan, surprised. Rabbi Eleazar replied: \"When we discuss Ma’aseh Merkavah, the Mysteries of the Chariot, the Shekhinah descends to listen, accompanied by many angels. Should I, then, be seated upon a donkey?\" Rabbi Eleazar then began to discourse upon these very mysteries, and as he spoke a circle of fire descended from heaven to surround that field, and a song of praise rose up from the trees. And in the center of that circle an angel appeared, who stood before them and said: \"Indeed, these are the very same Mysteries of the Chariot that are spoken of behind the Pargod.\" Then the angel disappeared, and they heard nothing more than the wind. At that moment Rabbi Yohanan turned to his student and kissed him on the forehead. \"How blessed is God to have a son like Abraham, and how blessed is Abraham to have a son such as you. Rabbi Eleazar.\" Rabbi Yehoshua learned of this incident from Rabbi Yossi ha-Kohen while they were also traveling along a road. They too agreed to stop and discuss the Mysteries of the Chariot. All at once the skies became covered with clouds and a splendid rainbow appeared. And the rabbis saw that clusters of angels had gathered around to listen, like guests at a wedding who rejoice with the bride and groom. Later Rabbi Yossi told Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai what had happened. And Rabbi Yohanan replied: \"Fortunate are we to have been so blessed. And now I know why I dreamed last night that you and I were sitting together on Mount Sinai when we heard a heavenly voice telling us to rise, for magnificent palaces and golden beds awaited us in Paradise, where we were to join the souls that sit before the Divine Presence.\" There are two primary categories of early kabbalistic contemplation: those linked to Ma'aseh Bereshit or The Work of Creation, and those linked to Ma'aseh Merkavah, or The Work of the Chariot. The former focuses on the mystical meaning of Creation as described in Genesis, and the latter on the vision of Ezekiel. Here the discussion of Ezekiel's vision and its mystical implications invokes yet another vision, shared by two rabbis, of angels dancing in a field. In many ways this talmudic tale defines the essential kabbalistic experience, presenting it in a positive and powerful fashion, and making it clear that Jewish mysticism is not merely a text-oriented study, but involves actual mystical experiences. Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai was one of the great talmudic sages, but here the sage accompanying him is the one who invokes the mystical vision. This tale serves as a primary model for many tales found in the Zohar, where two or more rabbis discover that the lowly Jew who is traveling with them is actually a hidden saint, who reveals great kabbalistic mysteries to them, or invokes a mystical vision.",

      "title": "The Eighth Heaven",
      "content": "There are not only seven heavens, but there is even an eighth heaven. It is found above the heads of the living creatures, as it is said. Above the heads of the creatures was a form: an expanse , with an awe-inspiring gleam as of crystal, was spread out above their heads (Ezek. 1:22). This is the place where the most hidden mysteries are to be found. But it is not permitted to reveal any more about them, as it said. The hidden things are for God , the revealed things are for our children (Deut. 29:28).",
      "commentary": "While Jewish lore often speaks of seven heavens, and these are described in detail in various rabbinic texts and in the Hekhalot texts that recount heavenly journeys, little is said about an eighth heaven. But in B. Hagigah 13a, Rabbi Aha ben Jacob mentions the eighth heaven, which is described as being above the hayot or living creatures that hold up God's throne. This is the ultimate place of mysteries, and such mysteries could not be revealed: \"The things that are the mystery of the world should be kept secret\" (B. Hag. 13a). The existence of such an eighth heaven may be inferred since the living creatures in the seventh heaven hold up the Throne of Glory, and Ezekiel 1:1314 describes a vast expanse that is understood to be another firmament ( raki'a ) above their heads. This eighth heaven is an essential part of Gnostic speculation, where it is described as a power beyond the reach of the seven heavens. See Poimandres 26.",

      "number": 219,
      "title": "The Pargod",
      "content": "There is an exceedingly wonderful curtain in Paradise, spread before God, which separates God from the angels. That curtain is entirely covered with supernal illuminations, forming the letters of the complete Name of God. All forms and representations in this world are depicted there, just the way they are in the world below. This curtain is known as the Pargod. Only God's Bride and the angel Metatron, Prince of the Presence, are permitted on God's side of the curtain. The deeds of all the generations of the world, past and present, are printed there, until the last generation. When Rabbi Ishmael ascended on high, Metatron took him to the Pargod. There Metatron pointed out all the generations that would follow, like a father teaching his son the letters of the Torah. And there Rabbi Ishmael witnessed all the generations from the time of Adam until the days of the Messiah, and all of their deeds were recounted there. Not only did he witness these deeds with his own eyes, but he experienced them as if they were taking place. \\ After witnessing all of the generations printed on that heavenly curtain. Rabbi Ishmael opened his mouth, saying. How many are the things You have made, O Lord; the earth is full of Your creations (Ps. 104:24). 3 Enoch records Rabbi Ishmael's ascent into heaven, led by the angel Metatron, the Prince of the Presence. As part of his tour of heaven, Metatron takes him to the Pargod, the curtain that separates God from the angels. This curtain is the heavenly counterpart of the curtain that separated the Holy of Holies in the earthly Tabernacle and Temple. (See Exodus 26:31 and 2 Chronicles 3:14.)",
      "commentary": "This myth demonstrates that God, and the mysteries of God, are hidden even from the angels, except for Metatron. Just as humans are not supposed to view God face to face, neither are the angels. There are occasional exceptions to this rule, whereby, for example, Moses ascends to the Throne of Glory and speaks to God face to face (B. Men. 29b and B. Shab. 88b-89a). The Pargod is also known as Pargod ha-Makom — the Curtain of the Place of God. The identification of Makom as the place of God comes from the dream of Jacob, when he said. This is none other than the abode of God, and that is the gateway to heaven (Gen. 28:17) The term Makom is also a designation for God, and is often translated as \"God Almighty.\" In this myth, the Pargod is the curtain that God is hidden behind, which has printed on it the history of all generations from the first to the last. Thus the whole course of human history has already been determined in the heavenly realm and has been preordained by God. This motif of God's foreknowledge of all generations is also found in The Book of Raziel, p. 253 and in the myths about the pre-existence of the Torah. See \"Seven Things Created Before the Creation,\" p. 74. Shloyshe Sheorim describes a heavenly curtain that separates the men from the women in Paradise. See \"Women in Paradise,\" p. 190.",

When Metatron, Prince of the Presence, took Rabbi Ishmael on a tour of heaven, he showed him that place. As Rabbi Ishmael walked by his side, hand in hand, Metatron pointed out the stars glowing like fiery sparks clustered around the Merkavah, the very Throne and Chariot of God Almighty. At that moment Metatron clapped his hands, and chased the stars away from there. They flew off with flaming wings, and fled from the four sides of God's Throne, and as the stars flew by, Metatron told Rabbi Ishmael the name of every single one of them, as it is said. He reckoned the number of the stars ; to each He gave its name (Ps. 147:4). For God had given every one of them a name. All the stars in the firmament are counted by the angel Rahatiel, for they are the handiwork of God. They come forth to be counted in order to praise God with songs and hymns, as it is said. The heavens declare the glory of God (Ps. 19:1). But in the time to come God will create them anew, and they will open their mouths and utter a song to the Lord. In this celestial myth, the stars are regarded as animate beings, much like angels. Above all they are drawn to surround God's Throne, the Merkavah , which is also portrayed as a chariot. In this view, the stars, like the angels, exist primarily to praise God, and they are fully under the control of heaven, as indicated here by the ease with which Metatron claps his hand and they depart. 3 Enoch is a treasure-trove of information about the fantastic geography of heaven. In later Jewish texts, such as those of Maimonides, this mythic view of the stars would be replaced by a speculative astrological view.",

The arches of this rainbow are set above Aravot, the highest heaven, and clouds of the rainbow surround the Throne of Glory. Above the arches of the rainbow are the wheels of the Merkavah. The rainbow itself rests upon the shoulders of the angel Kerubiel, the Prince of the Cherubim. This angel has a mouth that is like a lamp of fire, a tongue of consuming fire, eyebrows like lightning, and eyes like sparks of brilliance. On his head there is a crown of holiness on which God's Name is engraved. Between his shoulders rests the rainbow of the Shekhinah, and the splendor of the Shekhinah is on his face.",
      "commentary": "Here the rainbow of the Shekhinah is described as a heavenly counterpart of the earthly rainbow. Its sources can be found in Genesis 9:13 and in Ezekiel 1:28: Like the appearance of the bow which shines in the clouds on a day of rain, such was the appearance of the surrounding radiance. Ezekiel's vision also links the rainbow with the vision of the Merkavah: Above the expanse over their heads was the semblance of a throne (Ezek. 1:26). Building on the vision of Ezekiel, this divine rainbow is described as one of the heavenly splendors, in terms that link it to other mythic elements in the divine constellation. These include the Throne of Glory and the wheels of the Merkavah, the Divine Chariot. (Note that in Ezekiel's visions, there is some kind of combination of the identity of the Throne of Glory and the Divine Chariot.) These are known as \"the wheels of the Ophanim.\" Imposed on all this is a gigantic angel, Kerubiel, Prince of the Cherubim, with the rainbow of the Shekhinah resting between his shoulders. The angel Kerubiel is described in terms almost identical to Metatron, the fiery angel who is the focus of 3 Enoch. Both angels seem to represent the sun, which explains the strange image of the rainbow resting on the angel's shoulders, since the rainbow is seen when the rain has stopped and the sun has reemerged.",

      "title": "The Music Of The Spheres",
      "content": "Heaven is always making music, with perfect harmony, created in accordance with its celestial motions, as it is said. The heavens declare the glory of God (Ps. 19:2). Some say the source of this music is an orchestra of angels. Others say it is the rhythm and melody of the planets and stars as they circle the heavens. If, by chance, this music should reach our ears, irrepressible cravings would emerge, frenzied longings, and insane passions. These longings would be so great, we would no longer take nourishment from food and drink in the manner of mortals, but as beings destined for immortality. This happened to Moses when he ascended Mount Sinai. There, for forty days and nights, he touched neither bread nor water. Soon the strains of this heavenly music reached his ears, along with the words of the Torah as God recited them. It is said that for the rest of his life Moses heard this unearthly music, just as the light that shone from his face after Sinai always remained with him. Here Philo draws on the Pythagorean concept of the music of the spheres. Philo's immediate source was probably an ancient midrash, which is found in Sefer Hadar Zekenim Toratam shel Rishonim. (See Ginzberg, Legends, 5:36, note 102.) However, its inclusion in his writings is consistent with his interest in Greek concepts. In the Greek view, music was believed to reflect divine harmony. The rhythm and melody of the heavenly bodies thus delineate the music of the spheres as well as reflect the moral order of the universe. The closest Jewish myth is that of the song of praise of the heavenly bodies, which grows out of Psalm 19:2: The heavens declare the glory ofYahweh. The progress of the sun in its circuit was said to produce a hymn of praise to God. See also Zohar 1:2316.",

Nearby there are rooms with even greater hardships to be found — those destined to die by the sword, those destined to die by famine, those destined for captivity, those destined for disgrace. And every day there are added hardships more severe than these, but whenever Israel blesses God's Name, these hardships are not permitted to leave the room.",
      "commentary": "So too are there treasuries of comfort, where ministering angels sit and weave garments of salvation, making crowns of life and fixing precious stones and pearls to them. These, too, are intended for the Israelites. One crown has the sun and moon and twelve constellations fastened to it. This crown is intended for David, King of Israel. When Moses was in heaven, God showed him all the treasuries that will be given to the righteous in the World to Come. Some of those treasuries were for those who obeyed God's commandments, others for those who took care of orphans. Among them Moses saw a very great treasury. He asked, \"And to whom will this treasury be given?\" God answered, \"That is the Treasury of Gifts. I will give it to whomever I want.\" There are many myths about heavenly treasuries. The Treasury of Merits contains ledgers that keep track of sorrows and hardships. This reinforces the idea that God observes all that takes place in a person's life and credits them for their suffering and hardships. See \"The Books of Life and Death,\" p. 289. So too are there treasuries of comfort, intended for the righteous in the World to Come. Moses encounters a mysterious, large treasury, which God identifies as the Treasury of Gifts, and God refuses to explain how He will determine who will receive those gifts. Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav identifies these free gifts as the life force. He states that this gift can only be received in idle moments. Therefore, even holy men need these idle moments to receive this life-force, which they then pass on to those who really need it. Thus for Rabbi Nachman times of leisure are just as sacred as times of prayer or study. In this he follows the pattern of his great-grandfather the Ba'al Shem Tov, who often took long walks in the forest. See \"The Treasury of Souls,\" p. 166.",

The souls of the righteous, along with the angels, continue to study Torah in the heavenly Garden of Eden. There each of the patriarchs and matriarchs and great sages has his or her own palace, where they teach myriads of students beneath tranquil canopies. It is possible to sit in the classroom of Maimonides, as well as the classroom of Rashi, the great commentator. Those who ascend even higher in heaven arrive at the palace of Moses, where the Torah is taught from the very lips of Moses. And those who ascend to the very highest heaven reach the palace of Abraham. Abraham's mastery of the Torah is said to be so great that those who hear him weep tears of joy. One of the primary traditional rewards for the righteous souls who ascended to Paradise was the opportunity to study Torah with the greatest sages of all time, including the patriarchs and great talmudic masters. Some texts even describe the Messiah teaching Torah in his heavenly palace, and there are even texts in which God Himself teaches Torah to the souls of the righteous.

In each chamber there are beautiful canopies, with angels set over them, and every day they are crowned with the radiance of the Shekhinah. The first palace is ruled by Bitiah, Pharaoh's daughter, who raised Moses as if he were her own son. She teaches the commandments of the Torah to the many thousands of myriads of pious women who are with her, and she serves as their queen. These women still maintain their human form, and they are clothed in garments of light, and there is great joy among them. Three times a day Bitiah goes to a place where there is a curtain, and bows before the image of Moses, saying, \"Fortunate am I for drawing such a light out of the water.\" The next palace is that of Serah bat Asher, who rules over thousands of myriads of righteous women. They busy themselves with praises of the Lord, and contemplate the commandments of the Torah. Three times a day Serah goes to a curtain and bows before the image of Joseph, saying, \"Happy was the day on which I gave the good news about Joseph to my grandfather, Jacob.\" The other palaces are presided over by Yocheved, the mother of Moses, Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Moses, and Deborah the prophetess. All day long the women are by themselves, as are the men, for there is a curtain spread out in Paradise that separates them. But every night they come together at midnight, for that is the hour of copulation. Then they cleave soul to soul and light to light, and the fruit of this union are the souls of those who become converts to Judaism.",

      "title": "The Tent Of The Sun",
      "content": "It is a journey of five hundred years between one firmament to another, and the sun makes this journey covered with a tent, as it is said. He placed in them a tent for the sun (Ps. 19:5). The sun rises in the east, riding forth in a chariot crowned as a bridegroom. Three letters of God's Name are written upon the heart of the sun, and angels lead it. His fiery face looks down upon the earth in the summer, but in winter the face of the sun turns icy, and were it not for fire, nothing would be able to endure. Thus the sun runs his course across the heavens, and as he sets in the west, the sun bows down before God, saying: \"Master of the universe, I have fulfilled all Your commands.\" At the End of Days God will roll open the upper firmament, and then God will remove the tent from the sun. On that day God will make a tent for the righteous and hide them in it from the searing heat of the Day of Judgment. Just as there are sun myths in other traditions, so too are there sun myths in Judaism. Here the sun is personified and rides in a chariot led by angels, much as Apollo guides the chariot of the rising sun. There are some beautiful details, such as three letters of God's Name written on the heart of the sun. The tent of the sun is elsewhere described as a sheath, as in Midrash Tanhuma, where it is said that \"The sun is kept within its sheath, but during the Tammuz solstice, it emerges from its sheath to ripen fruits\" (Midrash Tanhuma , Ve-Atah Tetzaveh 6). The purpose of this tent/sheath is to prevent the sun from incinerating the world: \"The orb of the sun is kept within a sheath, in front of which there is a pool of water. When the sun comes out, God tempers its strength in the water, so that as it goes forth it will not incinerate the world\" (Genesis Kabbah 6:6). The image of the sun's chariot derives from 2 Kings 23:11: the chariots of the sun. The rolling open of the upper firmament derives from the passage. The heavens shall be rolled up like a scroll (Isa. 34:4). The tent of the sun is described (Y. A.Z. 3) as a pool of water set in front of the sun. When the sun comes forth, God diminishes the sun's power by immersing it in the water, so that it will not go out and consume the world. The key images of this myth, including that of the tent of the sun and of the sun as a bridegroom grow out of Psalms 19:5-6: He placed them in a tent for the sun, who is like a groom coming forth from his chamber, like a hero , eager to run his course . Note that the descriptions of the angel Metatron portray him in terms that seem identical to the sun, suggesting that the myth of Metatron may well be a remnant of a sun myth in Judaism. See \"The Metamorphosis and Enthronement of Enoch,\" p. 156.",

The hooks of heaven are fastened to the waters of the ocean, and the edges of heaven are spread over the waters. This myth of the heavens forming a tent is based on the verse Who spread out the skies like gauze, stretched them out like a tent to dwell in (Isa. 40:22). Of course, the image of the tent is a resonant one in Judaism, where the 40 years the Israelites spent wandering in the desert, sleeping in tents, serve as an archetype of Jewish experience. The simple, primitive notion that the sky is a big tent also emphasizes the role of God in ruling over the entire world. It also suggests the idea that heaven and earth together form God's palace, as stated in Isaiah 66:1, \" The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool .\" A similar notion is expressed in Habakkuk 3:3, His majesty fills the skies , His splendor fills the earth.",

His head was white and pure like wool, as it is said. And the hair of His head was like pure wool (Dan. 7:9). Here Enoch ascends to the highest heaven, Aravot, and sees God, here identified as the Ancient of Days (alternately translated as \"Antecedent of Time\" or \"Head of Days\"), accompanied by the angels, entering a crystal structure that appears to be some kind of heavenly palace. We know that this figure is God because of the description of His hair, which is white and like pure wool. This is an often-echoed description of God from Daniel 7:9: And the hair of His head was like pure wool. This scene of God accompanied by the angels in heaven is reminiscent of God walking in the Garden of Eden (Gen. 3:8).",

      "title": "The Celestial Academy",
      "content": "Not a day passes in which God does not teach a new law in the heavenly academy. Just as the souls of the holy sages each teach in their own heavenly palace, so God teaches in the Celestial Academy. It is said that God assigns the righteous a closer place to the divine glory than He does for the angels. And the angels are always asking them, \"What has God taught you?\" There are certain matters that must be left undecided until God comes and teaches the truth, for one day God will settle all unresolved questions of the Law. But God is not the only teacher in the Celestial Academy. Elijah and the Messiah also teach there. And until God delivers a final decision, it is Elijah's task to settle all doubts on ritual and judicial matters. So too does the Messiah elucidate the words of the Torah, and point out where the Law has been misconstrued. After God has spoken, the sages of the Celestial Academy discuss God's rulings, and sometimes debate them. Then who will settle the matter? On one occasion they decided that it should be Rabbah bar Nachmani, who was alive on earth at that time, for he was an expert on these laws. A messenger was sent for him, but the Angel of Death could not approach him, because he did not interrupt his studies for even a moment. Meanwhile, a wind blew that rustled the bushes, and he imagined it to be a troop of soldiers. \"Let me die,\" he cried out, \"rather than be delivered into their hands.\" As his soul took leave of this world, a heavenly voice called out, \"Happy are you, O Rabbah bar Nachmani, whose soul has departed in purity.\" At that time a letter fell from the sky to Pumbedita, upon which was written, \"Rabbah bar Nachmani has been called up to the Celestial Academy.\" Another visit to the Celestial Academy took place after the death of Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai. Rabbi Hiyya went to visit his grave and said: \"Dust, be not proud, for Rabbi Shimon, the pillar of the world, will never waste away in you.\" And Rabbi Hiyya wept, and when he left there he was still weeping. That is when Rabbi Hiyya began to fast so that he might be permitted to see Rabbi Shimon's place in Paradise. After fasting for forty days, he dreamed that an angel came and told him he could not see Rabbi Shimon. Then Rabbi Hiyya continued to fast and weep for another forty days. And on the eightieth day Rabbi Hiyya dreamed that he saw Rabbi Shimon in Paradise. He was teaching while thousands listened, sages and angels alike. Then, in the dream. Rabbi Shimon said: \"Let Rabbi Hiyya enter here, to see what awaits him in the World to Come.\" That is when Rabbi Hiyya awoke, and when he opened his eyes, he saw a winged angel standing beside the bed, and he understood that it had been sent to bring him to Paradise. Then Rabbi Hiyya mounted the angel, and they ascended at once to the Celestial Academy. There Rabbi Hiyya saw Rabbi Shimon standing exactly as he had seen him in his dream, discussing the same point of the Law. All at once there was a heavenly voice saying, \"Make way for King Messiah, who is coming to Rabbi Shimon's academy.\" And all of the righteous stood and made a path for the Messiah. Just then the Messiah saw Rabbi Hiyya and said: \"Who brought this mortal here?\" Rabbi Shimon replied: \"This is Rabbi Hiyya, who is the light of the lamp of the Torah.\" And the Messiah said: \"Then let him be gathered here.\" \"No,\" said Rabbi Shimon, \"Let him be given more time.\" When the Messiah heard the words of Rabbi Shimon, he nodded in assent, and at that moment the winged angel brought Rabbi Hiyya back to this world. And an instant later he found himself alone in his room, and he could not stop shaking. Just as there are earthly academies where the Torah is studied and the laws are debated, so is there said to be a Celestial Academy, where God creates and teaches new laws every day. This notion is an interesting one, in that it suggests the everexpanding nature of the Torah. The fact that it is God who is doing the teaching gives the seal of approval to this open-ended approach to Torah. This rabbinic myth can be seen to serve as a self-justification, arguing the correctness of this approach. The proof that God teaches on high is found in the verse Hear attentively the sound of His voice , and the meditation that comes forth from His mouth (Job 37:2). Genesis Rabhah 49:2 explains that \"meditation\" refers to the Torah, as in the verse But you shall meditate therein day and night (Josh. 1:8). According to Genesis Rabbah, these are the laws of the Torah that even Abraham was said to know. Since the Torah was not given until the time of Moses, rabbis were frustrated that the earlier patriarchs did not know the Torah. This was so difficult to accept that there are various legends about how they received the Torah anyway, such as the chain of legends about the Book of Raziel, which is a clear mask for the Torah. But there is another notion, that there were certain laws of the Torah that Abraham knew, since, for example, he followed the laws of circumcision. How did Abraham learn these laws? This myth from Genesis Rabbah suggests that he somehow learned them directly from God, as these are the same laws that God teaches in heaven. In some fashion, which is not described, Abraham was privy to these teachings. Rabbah bar Nachmani receives an invitation from heaven to resolve a debate in the Celestial Academy. The Angel of Death is sent as a messenger to bring him, but is unable to do so because he never stops studying the Torah. This reflects the tradition that the Angel of Death cannot take a man while he is studying Torah. A similar story is told about King David and the Angel of Death, in which the angel had to create a diversion to lure David away from his studies, so that he could take his soul. Unlike Rabbah bar Nachmani, Rabbi Hiyya, disciple of Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai, is determined to go to the Celestial Academy even though he does not have an invitation. Rabbi Hiyya fasts to achieve something that is not permitted to the living— to see Shimon bar Yohai's place in Paradise. This tale confirms the taboo of a human entering into Paradise, which finds its model in the tale of the ascent of Moses into heaven to receive the Torah. The angels sought to cast him out of Paradise, for none of the living are permitted there (B. Shab. 88b). See \"The Ascent of Moses,\" p. 261. For another account of a journey into Paradise by one of the living, see \"Rabbi Joshua ben Levi and the Angel of Death,\" p. 207. The account of Rabbi Hiyya's efforts to travel to the Celestial Academy, from the Zohar , may have been inspired by a talmudic myth concerning Rabbi Hiyya found in B. Bava hAetzia 85b. Here one rabbi sees another whose eyes appeared as though they had been burnt. He asks him what has happened, and the rabbi explains that he asked Elijah to show him the souls of departed rabbis as they ascend to the Celestial Academy. Elijah agreed that he could look upon all except for the carriage of Rabbi Hiyya. How would he recognize Rabbi Hiyya's carriage? All would be accompanied by angels when they ascend except Rabbi Hiyya's, which ascends on its own. But the rabbi disobeyed and did gaze upon Rabbi Hiyya's carriage, and at that instant two fiery streams came forth, which blinded him. The next day this rabbi prostrated himself on the grave of Rabbi Hiyya, and his sight was healed.",

      "content": "The Primordial Metatron was the first of creation, the son of the Shekhinah. The first words of the Torah, In the beginning God created, refer to Metatron. The Primordial Metatron assisted God in the creation of the world, and has assisted God ever since in ruling the worlds above and below. When God said to Moses, \"Come up to the Lord,\" he meant to come up to Metatron. This description of a Primordial Metatron closely resembles the myths about the Heavenly Man and Adam Kadmon. What is unusual is that the primordial Metatron is described as the son of the Shekhinah. Since this myth is found in the Zohar, the Shekhinah refers to God's Bride, making the Primordial Metatron the child of God and the Shekhinah. The Christian echoes of the \"son of God\" are apparent, as well as the structure of a divine family as is found in other mythic traditions, such as the Greek or Canaanite. See \"The Heavenly Man,\" p. 124 and \"Adam Kadmon,\" p. 15. The identification of \"the Lord\" as Metatron is, surprisingly, found in the Talmud. For a further discussion of this, see the Introduction, p. 1. The notion of a Primordial Metatron contradicts the standard explanation of Metatron' s origin as Enoch, who was transformed into Metatron after being carried into heaven in a fiery chariot. It demonstrates an alternate Metatron tradition apart from that linked to Enoch. Of course, the original Enoch tradition dates from around the second century bce, and the Zohar from the thirteenth century. Thus it is possible that this is one of many new mythic traditions found in the Zohar.",

Metatron sits on that throne at the entrance to the seventh heavenly palace, where he judges all the upper beings, the family on high, with the permission of God. So too does he offer the souls of the righteous in the heavenly Temple as an atonement for the Jewish people. The hand of God rests on the head of His servant, whose height is that of the entire universe, and the attending angels stand before him. When Surya, the Prince of the Presence, goes in to arrange and to set in order God's Throne of Glory and to prepare a seat for Metatron, the Mighty One of Jacob, he binds a thousand diadems of majesty upon the heads of each of them, and kneels and falls down and prostrates himself a thousand times before each one. Before God appointed Metatron to serve the Throne of Glory, God opened up three hundred thousands gates of discernment to him, and as many gates of cunning, compassion, and love, as well as the gates of humility, sustenance, mercy, and the fear of heaven. And God revealed the mysteries of the Torah to him and all the secrets of wisdom, and all the secrets of Creation. Then God gave Metatron a royal crown that included 49 precious stones, each as bright as the light of the sun. The light of these stones penetrates to the far comers of all seven heavens. God Himself engraved on Metatron's crown the letters with which the heavens and the earth and all their hosts were created. So too did God give him His cloak. His crown, and His name. And God made Metatron a garment with all types of light in it, and He dressed him in it. So too did God give Metatron the highest splendor, which is the light of the soul that Adam forfeited by his sin. And God sent forth a herald, who announced that Metatron was ruler over all the princes of heaven and over all the children of heaven. And every angel who had to speak in God's presence should speak to him instead. Indeed, there are those who say that Metatron is the Lord God of Israel, God of the heavens and God of the earth, God of Gods, God of the sea and God of the land.",
      "commentary": "This is Metatron, Prince of the Presence. The angels who are with him encircle the Throne of Glory on one side and the celestial beasts are on the other side, and the Shekhinah is in the center of the Throne of Glory. And God called Metatron the lesser Yahweh before His entire heavenly family, as it is said, for \"My Name is within him \" (Exod. 23:23). Then Metatron says in a great voice, \"The Throne of Glory is glistening!\" Immediately, the angels surrounding the throne fall silent and hasten into the river of fire, and the celestial creatures turn their faces toward the earth. Then Metatron brings the fire of deafness and puts it in their ears, so that they do not hear the sound of God's speech and the explicit Name that Metatron utters at that time in seven voices, or, some say, seventy voices in all. In the Hekhalot texts, describing heavenly journeys, the angel Metatron is described in terms that are virtually equal, and sometimes superior, to those used to describe God. When Hekhalot Rabbati describes Metatron as \"Lord God of Israel, God of heavens and God of the earth, God of Gods, God of the sea and God of the land,\" there is little doubt that the author regards Metatron at least as the \"Lesser Yahweh,\" if not as God's equal. Just the fact that both God and Metatron are served by Surya, the Prince of the Presence is a clear indication of their divine status, and he is described as treating them equally, prostrating himself a thousand times before each one. According to Gershom Scholem, Metatron was a secret name for Michael. Michael is not only one of the archangels, but he is also the High Priest in the heavenly Temple, so that his role is already elevated, although not to the heights of Metatron. Metatron is more commonly linked to Enoch and the belief that Enoch had been transformed into Metatron. See \"The Metamorphosis and Enthronement of Metatron,\" p. 156.",

      "content": "Now the angels do not have permission to sing in heaven until the children of Israel first raise their voices in song on earth. Only when the angels hear praises of Israel can they commence to sing. When it comes time to attend to the songs and music and praises that ascend from earth from the synagogues and schools, there is a certain angel, Sandalphon, who stands above the windows of the firmament. As the prayers of Israel are offered, all the words uttered ascend on high, cleaving their way through ethers and firmaments, until they reach Sandalphon. He stands behind the Throne of God and wreathes crowns out of those prayers. When the crowns are ready, he adjures them so that they rise of their own accord and come to rest on the head of God, as it is said. Blessings light upon the head of the righteous (Prov. 10:6). And when the crown reaches God's head, all the hosts on high shake with awe, and the creatures of the chariot roar like lions, and all of them cry out. Holy , holy , holy! The Lord of Hosts (Isa. 6:3). Sandalphon is one of the most prominent of the angels in fewish lore. He is said to be so tall that if he were standing on the earth, his head would reach into the highest heaven. In the myths about the ascent of Moses into heaven, Moses sees Sandalphon standing behind God's throne. See \"The Ascent of Moses/' p. 261. But the most common myth about Sandalphon concerns his gathering the prayers of Israel and forming them into crowns of prayer for God to wear on His Throne of Glory.",

      "content": "The archangel Michael is Israel's patron angel. Once Michael praised Israel for her loyalty to God. Overhearing this, Satan declared that he could take away the holiness entrusted to Israel. Through sin and strife, Satan succeeded in snatching it away, and the Temple was destroyed and the people sent into exile. The angel Michael led them into exile, but then he abandoned them. But the day will come when it will be proved that Israel did not intentionally surrender her trust, and then she will regain the favor of her patron angel.",
      "commentary": "This myth grows out of the tradition that each nation has its own guardian angel, and Michael is the guardian angel of Israel. Here Israel loses Michael's trust through sin and strife, triggered by Satan, and the only hope for Israel is to regain Michael's trust. This, it appears, would be the equivalent of the coming of the Messiah. Other myths describe God as Israel's guardian, while all other nations have angels.

      "content": "Elijah was translated, body and soul, from this world to the world above, as it is said, A fiery chariot with fiery horses suddenly appeared . . . and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind (2 Kings 2:11). Nor did he ever taste death, but he was transformed into an angel. At that time Elijah received a celestial body, which made it possible for him to ascend to heaven. But when he descends to earth on a mission, he resumes wearing his terrestrial body. The angel Elijah has giant wings, and with four strokes of his wings he can travel from one end of the world to the other. Therefore no place on earth is too far removed for his help. Thus he serves as a protector of the just and pious, hovering over them and guarding them against evil and saving them from danger.",
      "commentary": "Some say that Elijah was originally created as an angel, and later he descended to earth as the prophet Elijah. Others say that the heavenly Elijah is none other than the angel Sandalphon, one of the greatest and mightiest of the heavenly hosts. Thus, Elijah is known as Sandalphon on high, but when he descends to this world, he is known as Elijah. Elijah is not only an important prophet, but the manner of his departure from earth, carried into heaven in a fiery chariot, inspired extensive rabbinic and folk traditions about Elijah's role after he was taken into Paradise. There are hundreds of tales about Elijah returning to earth as God's messenger, meeting with the great sages of subsequent generations and assisting the poor in their times of desperation. It was Elijah who was said to have taught Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai the secrets of heaven that were later written down in the Zohar, during the 13 years Shimon bar Yohai remained in hiding in a cave from the Romans. In this role as a teacher, Elijah created the role of the Tzaddik, who imparts holy secrets to those worthy of receiving them. And it is Elijah whom, it is said, will sound the hom of the ram that Abraham sacrificed at Mount Moriah to announce the beginning of the messianic era. In addition to these traditions about Elijah's role in this world, there are tales about Elijah's role in heaven. Here he is described as having been transformed into an angel, or, in an alternate version, having been created as an angel in the first place. One myth identifies him as the angel Sandalphon when he is in heaven, and as Elijah when he descends to this world. See \"The Angel Sandalphon,\" p. 197. The most striking parallel to Elijah is the myth of Enoch. Just as Elijah was carried into paradise in a chariot, so too was Enoch brought into heaven the same way when God took him (Gen. 5:24). And just as Elijah is described here as being transformed into angel, so too was Enoch transformed into the angel Metatron. Both of them are among the most important angels, taking orders directly from God. In fact, it seems likely that the extensive mythic tradition about Enoch was inspired by the description of Elijah being taken into heaven in a fiery chariot. See \"The Metamorphosis of Enoch,\" p. 156.",

And God receives it and gives it to the heavenly scribes, that they may read it in the Great Court of Justice, in the highest heaven, before the heavenly household. There are a multitude of angels listed in various ancient Jewish texts, each with his own particular role to play. Although Metatron is identified as the heavenly scribe, Radweriel is identified as the Keeper of the Book of Records. This is the book that contains a record of everything that a person does, so that on Rosh ha-Shanah God can weigh their good and bad deeds and make a decision about whether their lives should be renewed for another year, a decision that is sealed ten days later on Yom Kippur.",

      "content": "God does not utter evil decrees Himself, as it is said, It is not at the word of the Most High, that weal and woe befall (Lam. 3:38). Instead, God has the angel Gallizur utter all evil decrees. Gallizur also reveals the secrets of God. So too does he open his wings to absorb the fiery breath of the creatures of the chariot, for if he did not absorb it, the angels would be consumed by their fiery breath. Gallizur also takes braziers filled with coals from the river Rigyon, the river of fire, whose coals consume angels and men, and he holds these up near angels and kings, so that fear of the angels and kings will strike the world. This obscure angel is in charge of pronouncing God's evil decrees. This is an attempt to resolve the theological problem of God's role in the existence of evil. In monotheism, God is responsible for both good and evil. On the other hand, God is portrayed as being entirely good, and it would be inappropriate and unseemly for God to pronounce evil decrees, as stated in Lamentations 3:38. Therefore the angel Gallizur takes over this role and pronounces evil decrees for God. There is perhaps a hint here of a Gnostic dualism.",

      "title": "The Angel Of Conception",
      "content": "Among the angels there is one who serves as the midwife of souls. This is Lailah, the Angel of Conception. When the time has come for a man and his wife to conceive a child, God directs Lailah to seek out a certain soul hidden in the Garden of Eden, and command it to enter a drop of semen. At first the soul refuses, for it still remembers the pain of being bom, and it prefers to remain pure. But Lailah compels the soul to obey, and that is when God decrees what the fate of that sperm will be, whether male or female, strong or weak, rich or poor, and so on. Then the angel turns around and places the soul in the womb of the mother.",
      "commentary": "While the infant grows in the womb, Lailah places a lighted candle at the head of the unborn infant, so he can see from one end of the world to the other, as it is said. His lamp shone above my head , and by His light I walked through darkness (Job 29:3). For nine months Lailah watches over the unborn infant, teaching him the entire Torah as well as the history of his soul. During this time, the evil inclination has no power over him. And before he is bom, he is given an oath to keep his soul pure, lest God take it back from him. Then Lailah leads the child into the Garden of Eden, and shows him the righteous ones with crowns on their heads. So too does Lailah lead the child to the netherworld and show him the punishments of Gehenna. But when the time has come to be bom, the angel extinguishes the lamp, and brings forth the child into the world. The instant the child emerges, Lailah lightly strikes the newborn above the lip, causing it to cry out. And at that instant the infant forgets all it has learned. That is the origin of the mark on the upper lip, which everyone bears. Indeed, Lailah is a guardian angel, who watches over that child all of his days. And when the time has come to take leave of this world, it is Lailah who comes to him and says, \"Do you not recognize me? The time of your departure has come. I have come to take you from this world.\" Thereupon Lailah leads him to the World to Come, where he renders an accounting before God, and he is judged according to his merits. This myth describes the formation of a child. The soul is here revealed to have been drawn from on high and sent to this world reluctantly. Such a myth affirms the rabbinic belief in the essential purity of the human soul, which is subjected to the power of the Yetzer ha-Ra, the Evil Inclination. This myth of conception is also a reminder of God's powerful role in every stage of our lives. A famous passage in Pirke Avot 3:1 says: \"Know where you came from, where you are going, and before whom you will in the future have to give account and reckoning. Where you came from — from a fetid drop; where you are going— to a place of dust, worms and maggots; and before whom you will in the future have to give account and reckoning — before God, the Supreme King of kings.\" According to Rabbi Meir ibn Gabbai in Avodat ha-Kodesh, \"Before a soul descends to this world, it recognizes the Oneness of God and grasps the secrets of the Torah.\" He links this intrinsic knowledge of the soul with the verse Open my eyes that I may perceive the wonder of Your teachings (Psalms 119:18). These are the wonders that were apprehended before the child was born. Although angels are generally regarded as sexless, and some rabbinic sources say they do not procreate, almost all of them bear male names such as Michael or Gabriel and they have male characteristics. In addition, the noun, malakh (angel) is grammatically masculine. However, Yalkut Hadash (Mai. 63 and 93) says: \"It is appropriate to distinguish between male and female angels.\" And there is one angel, the angel Lailah, who has distinctly feminine characteristics. This angel is responsible for the fetus, for assisting at birth, and for guiding the soul from this world to the next. In many ways Lailah is the polar opposite of Lilith, who wastes seed, is not maternal, and is bent on destruction, not creation. While the word Lailah, meaning \"night,\" is masculine, the name Lailah is feminine, and the name of this angel does not end in the usual \"el,\" representing God's Name. Thus, even though there is no direct evidence that Lailah is a feminine angel, the name Lailah and the role of the angel strongly indicate feminine characteristics. Lailah, the angel's name, likely derives from a rabbinic discussion in B. Niddah 16b, where conception is described as taking place at night. There the name of the angel in charge of conception is identified as \"Night\" (lailah). This angel takes a drop and places it before God. B. Niddah 30b adds important details about the formation of the embryo and the role of Lailah. It explains that a light shining above the unborn infant's head lets the child see from one end of the world to the other. At the same time, the angel teaches the unborn child the Torah. But as soon as the child is born, the angel strikes it on the upper lip, causing the infant to forget all he has learned. The full myth of Lailah and the formation of the embryo is found in Midrash Tanhuma Pekudei 3. For more on the tradition of guardian angels in Judaism, see \"Guardian Angels,\" p. 202. According to Rabbi Menashe ben Israel in Nishmat Hayim 2:18, God breathes the soul into a person at conception, much as He did with Adam, when He blew into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living being (Gen. 2:7). This appears to be an alternate explanation for the version portrayed in the myth of Lailah, where the angel orders the soul to enter the seed.",

      "content": "Whoever has the sign of the circumcision sealed in his flesh will not descend to Gehenna. When a man brings his son into the covenant of the circumcision, God calls upon the angels and says to them, \"Come and see what my sons are doing in the world.\" At that time Elijah, the Angel of the Covenant, swoops down to earth in four leaps. For this reason, a chair must be prepared in Elijah's honor, and one should say, \"This is the chair of Elijah.\" If this is not done, Elijah does not dwell there. Then Elijah ascends on high and testifies before God about whether or not a man has circumcised his son. The covenant of circumcision (b'rit) is performed on Jewish boys on the eighth day after their birth. The ceremony includes a chair identified as the chair of Elijah, and Elijah is believed to be present at the ceremony. For this reason, Elijah, who was taken up into heaven in a whirlwind in 2 Kings 2:11, is identified as the angel of the covenant. This ritual of the b'rit derives from Abraham's circumcision in Genesis 17:24. This is considered the most elemental rite in Judaism, and it was (and in most Jewish homes still is) unthinkable that it would not be performed. This covenant was believed to provide God's protection for the child, who is believed to be in danger from the forces of evil until the ritual of the circumcision is performed.

      "content": "Rabbi Ishmael, the High Priest, was so handsome that he was said to resemble an angel. His mother and father had been childless for many years before he was bom. Rabbi Ishmael's father told his wife to pay close attention when she left the mikveh, the ritual bath. If anything unpleasant crossed her path, she should return to the bathhouse and immerse herself again. Then, perhaps, she would succeed in having a child. The next time his wife left the mikveh, a black dog crossed her path. She returned and reimmersed herself, but again the dog crossed before her. This happened eight times, and each time she reimmersed herself. God was so moved by her righteousness that He sent the angel Gabriel to earth. Gabriel took the form of her husband, and met her at the door of the bathhouse. He led her home and that night Rabbi Ishmael was conceived. And he was as handsome as his father, the angel Gabriel. Here the High Priest, Rabbi Ishmael, is said to have been the child of an angel and a human, with the angel Gabriel having taken on the appearance of his father and having had sexual relations with his mother. That is given as the explanation for Rabbi Ishmael's great beauty. The union of humans and angels is very unusual in Jewish lore, but there is an extensive tradition linked to the rabbinic interpretations of Genesis 6, concerning the Sons of God and the daughters of men, where the Sons of God are identified as angels. See the series of stories concerning this myth, pp. 454-460.",

      "content": "Everyone has a light burning for him in the world above, and everyone's light is unique. When two friends meet, their lights above are united, and out of that union of two lights an angel is bom. That angel has the strength to survive for only one year, unless its life is renewed when the friends meet again. But if they are separated for more than year, the angel begins to languish and eventually wastes away. That is why a blessing over the dead is made upon meeting a friend who has not been seen for more than a year, to revive the angel.",
      "commentary": "According to the Talmud (B. Berakhot 58b) two friends who have not seen each other for a year say the blessing: \"Blessed is He who revives the dead.\" The explanation for this strange blessing is that an angel comes into existence when two people become friends, but the angel dies if they go more than a year without meeting. This tradition about the Angel of Friendship has been attributed to Reb Pinhas of Koretz, Reb Shmelke of Nicholsberg and Reb Abraham Joshua Heschel of Apta. Another tradition about the creation and transformation of angels is attributed to Reb Pinhas of Koretz: \"Every good deed turns into an angel. But if the deed is imperfect, so is the angel. Perhaps it will be mute. What a disgrace to be served in Paradise by such an angel. Or it might have an arm or leg missing. And these imperfections can only be repaired by the repentance of the one who brought the imperfect angel into being.\" This kind of transformation is known as tikkun or repair, and it is parallel to the mystical cosmology of the Ari, where every good deed is said to raise up a fallen spark. The theme of good deeds in the transformation of the angels is common in kabbalistic and Hasidic lore. The key passage is Mishneh Avot 4:2: \"He who does a mitzvah acquires an advocate. He who does a sin acquires an accuser.\" This notion is further developed in Exodus Rabbah 32:6: \"The angels are sustained only by the splendor of the Shekhinah, and you are their means of sustenance,\" meaning that a good deed creates an angel. Rabbi Hayim Vital confirms this meaning in Sha'arei Kedushah, where he writes that \"the diligent study of the Law and the performance of the divine commandments brings about the creation of a new angel.\" This serves as an explanation for the existence of the maggidim, the angelic figures who are said to visit sages and bring them heavenly mysteries. Joseph Karo (1488-1575), author of the Shulhan Arukh, the gode of Jewish law, was famous for being visited by such a maggid. See \"The Angel of the Mishnah\" in Gabriels Palace , pp. 112-113. Another source echoed here is found in Ma'asiyot Noraim ve-Nifla'im concerning the gaon Rabbi Yehezkel of Prague (1713-1793). He was said to have stated that \"The angels that are found in the upper world were created by the deeds of the Tzaddikim.\" Note that Reb Pinhas has the angel that comes into being as a result of friendship, or, by implication, love, function as a symbolic child. This expands the circumstances for the creation of an angel to include angels created by human interaction.",

      "content": "God's angels are mighty, but they are not the equal of God. So great is the size of the angels, that the distance from heaven to earth is no more than the palm of an angel. Proof of the might of the angels is demonstrated by the fact that one of them stretched forth his hand from heaven and grasped Ezekiel by a lock of his hair, as it is said. He stretched out the form of a hand , and took me by the hair of my head (Ezek. 8:3). This teaches us that there is no limit to God's ministering angels. How much more so, then, is there no limit to God. This brief myth attempts to convey the great size and power of the angels, while emphasizing that the angels themselves are still subject to God. Since the size of the angels is so gigantic — with the palm of an angel as big as the distance from heaven to earth — the immense size and power of God cannot even be imagined. From a mythological perspective, this myth attributes the kind of size and power to the angels that other gods have in Babylonian or Canaanite or Greek mythology, but, at the same time, it attempts to reinforce the monotheistic concept that the angels are still subject to God's will.",

      "content": "There is an angel who watches over people, even in the dark. This is Yode'a, the Angel of Losses. He watches lives unfold, recording every detail before it fades. This angel has servants, and his servants have servants. Some of these servants are angels, and some are not. Each of the angels carries a shovel, and they spend all their time digging, searching for losses. For a great deal is lost in our lives. Every Tzaddik is a servant of the angel Yode'a, for even a Tzaddik who searches after lost things is himself sometimes lost. Then it is necessary to search in the dark, in the realm of the unknown. And with what do you search in the darkness? With the light of the soul. For the soul is a light planted in the Tzaddik to seek after whatever has been lost. What kind of light is it? Not a torch, but a small candle. Yet even so, with it you can search inside deep wells, where darkness is unbroken, peering into every comer and crevice. It is necessary to be guided by that light, small though it may be.",
      "commentary": "This is a teaching of Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav. Rabbi Nachman appears to have invented this angel, Yode'a, the angel of losses. Much like Reb Pinhas of Koretz, Rabbi Nachman was highly aware of surrounding spirits. For Reb Pinhas these were often angels. See, for example, \"The Angel of Friendship,\" p. 201. Here too Rabbi Nachman recognizes an angel that is invisible to all the others. In this case it is an obscure angel that he finds, the Angel of Losses. This angel, along with his servants, searches for what has been lost. The kind of work that this angel does is clearly linked to the myth of the Ari, for the second phase of this myth concerns gathering the scattered sparks. These are not unlike the losses that Yode'a collects, for the sparks too have been lost. Yode a means \"to know.\" Thus the angel's name reflects its purpose, which is to recall all that has been lost. See \"The Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks,\" p. 122.",

It was he who taught him the ways of wisdom. For the first year after the Ari died. Rabbi Hayim Vital never dreamed of his master. In time he began to fear that the Ari was angry with him or thought him an unworthy disciple. Hayim Vital confided these fears to Rabbi Yehoshua Albuv. Rabbi Yehoshua told him that he knew a holy name that could invoke the angel Tzadkiel, and that this angel could reveal to him the reason for the Ari's absence. But this angel could be seen only in a mirror. Rabbi Yehoshua taught the secret name to Hayim Vital. For the next week he fasted and immersed himself in the mikveh. Then, on the fifth of Av, the yahrzeit (anniversary) of the death of the Ari, Hayim Vital stood before a mirror and pronounced the holy name. All at once there was a blinding light in the mirror, and Hayim Vital shut his eyes. And when he opened them, he was barely able to make out a presence in the mirror. And as his eyes adjusted to that great light, he recognized that it was indeed an angel. The angel spoke first and said: \"I have come at your command. What is it you wish to know?\" And Hayim Vital replied: \"Tell me first who you are.\" And the angel revealed that it was Tzadkiel. Then Hayim Vital asked the angel for help in contacting the Ari in the World to Come, for since his death the Ari had been silent. And Hayim Vital also asked if he had somehow sinned and was therefore unworthy of the Ari's presence in his dreams. In reply Tzadkiel said: \"Know that the holy Ari has prepared a place for you in Paradise, at his side, along with Rabbi Akiba and Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai. For you are a true Tzaddik in the eyes of God. Yet there is one sin that holds the Ari back from visiting you in the world of dreams.\" And Hayim Vital asked: \"What sin is this?\" The angel said: \"In your life, you are perfect. But you have not done enough to see that others truly repent, to make the coming of the Messiah possible. Until you accept the",

      "content": "Before the enemy came, Jeremiah warned the people to repent so they would not have to go into exile. But the people said, \"If the enemy comes, what can they do to us? By invoking the aid of one of the celestial princes we can surround the city with a wall of water, and by invoking the aid of another, we can surround it with a wall of fire, while another angel will surround it with a wall of iron.\" Hearing this, God said, \"They would avail themselves of My angelic host.\" So God changed the roles of the angels, setting the angel who had dominion over water to have dominion over fire, and the one who had dominion over fire to have dominion over iron. So that when the names of the angels were invoked, they did not respond, for they had been removed from control of those elements.",
      "commentary": "This myth expands on the verses: He has brought low in dishonor the kingdom and its leaders (Lam. 2:2) and So I profaned the holy princes (Isa. 43:28). Here the princes are understood to refer to the celestial princes, especially those that are in charge of elements such as fire and water. This should be regarded as a polemical myth, opposing the use of (and dependence on) the invocation of the names of angels to accomplish magical goals. For other examples of polemic myths, see \"Adam the Last and First,\" p. 129 and \"Jacob's Image Cast Out of Heaven,\" p. 368.

But others say that the Angel of Death did not come into being until Cain slew Abel, for until then no one had died, and there was no need for such an angel. Then God transformed Cain into the Angel of Death, as punishment for having slain his brother, and that is how the Angel of Death came into being. Cain served as the Angel of Death for one hundred and thirty years, wandering and roaming about, accursed. After the death of Cain, Lamech took his place as the Angel of Death.",
      "commentary": "This myth attempts to determine when the Angel of Death was created based on the appropriate biblical episode. Because the serpent in the Garden of Eden led Adam and Eve into a sin that brought about mortality, it is identified in the Zohar as the Angel of Death. (Zohar 1:35b also identifies the serpent as Satan and as the Yetzer ha-Ra, the Evil Impulse that entices a person to sin and afterward rises up before the heavenly court to accuse the sinner.) Likewise, because Cain was the first murderer. Midrash Tanhuma identifies him as becoming transformed into the Angel of Death. Cain's descendent, Lamech, who was said to have accidentally slain Cain, is also identified as one who took on the mantle of the Angel of Death. See \"The Death of Cain,\" p. 451.",

      "title": "Rabbi Loew And The Angel Of Death",
      "content": "One night, not long before the Holy Days were to begin. Rabbi Loew glimpsed a light in the synagogue across the way, and he wondered who might be there at that hour. He left his house, and as he approached the synagogue he saw through the window a strange figure standing at the pulpit. The closer Rabbi Loew came, the more sinister did the figure seem, and suddenly Rabbi Loew realized who it was — the Angel of Death — and at the same time he came close enough to see the angel sharpening a knife over a long scroll on which many names were written. Rabbi Loew was pierced with terror and resisted a powerful impulse to run away. But a moment later he became calm and self-possessed, and he knew what he had to do. As silently as possible he opened the door of the synagogue and came up behind the dreaded angel. All at once he snatched the long list out of the angel's hands, tearing it away from him, and ran from the synagogue to his home, where he threw the list into the flames and watched until every scrap of it had burned to ashes. Now the plague had begun to spread in the city, and that was the list of victims the Angel of Death had come to take in one fell swoop. Now only those on the piece of the list left in his hands fell victim to him; all the rest were spared. But among those on the list was Rabbi Loew, and it was he, above all, whom the deadly angel was determined to capture. Rabbi Loew, who could read the lines of the future, knew that the angel would try to snatch him to seek revenge. But Rabbi Loew used his powers to avoid the angel, much as King David had done, studying Torah day and night. For the Angel of Death is forbidden to take a man while he is engaged in the study of Torah. Yet even so, the angel found a ruse by which to capture him. He hid in a rose of great beauty that grew in the garden of Rabbi Loew's grandson. One day the boy picked the rose as a gift for his grandfather, and as he held it in his hands to present to Rabbi Loew, the rabbi perceived the presence of the dark angel, hidden in the rose. Then he did not hesitate, but accepted the gift from his grandson, for he knew that if he did not, the boy's life would be endangered. But no sooner did Rabbi Loew take it in his hand than the Angel of Death struck him like a serpent and snatched his soul. The most famous tale of an encounter with the Angel of Death is that of King David, found in the Talmud. Here David learns that he is fated to die on a Sabbath. Knowing that the Angel of Death is forbidden to snatch a man while he is studying, David spends every Sabbath immersed in study. In frustration the Angel of Death creates a ruse by shaking a tree outside his study, and when David goes out to investigate, the angel snatches his life (B. Shab. 30a-b). A common theme found in folklore is that of the snake hidden in a rose, who bites the one who picks it. Such a theme is found in \"The Princess and the Rose” in the medieval collection Sefer Sha’ashuim. Another key legend of an encounter with the Angel of Death is found in the pseudepigraphal text The Testament of Abraham. Here the Angel of Death disguises himself as a young man of mild appearance, but reveals his true appearance when Abraham demands it. The description of its terrible face is one of the most horrible to be found anywhere. It is such a face that overwhelms the father and mother in \"The Bridegroom and the Angel of Death\" in Hibbur ha-Ma'asiyot ve-ha-Midrashot ve-haAggadot. In this story, the next of kin of the bridegroom all offer to take his place to spare him being snatched by the Angel of Death, until the moment of truth, when all back out, except for the bride, who so impresses God with her willingness to die that both bride and bridegroom are spared. See \"The Bridegroom and the Angel of Death\" in Gabriel’s Palace, pp. 162-164. A major study of the legends of the Angel of Death was undertaken by Haim Schwarzbaum in the last years of his life. Professor Dov Noy tells the story that he once asked Schwarzbaum why it was taking him so long to finish his book on the Angel of Death. Schwarzbaum replied that he believed the Angel of Death would prefer to take him after he had finished the book, and that is why he was taking his time. Unfortunately, he died before the book was completed.",

      "content": "When Manasseh reigned as king over Jerusalem, he wrought much evil in the sight of the Lord (2 Chron. 33:6). But when Manasseh was carried away to Babylon bound in fetters, he humbled himself before the Lord and prayed to Him. Now all the ministering angels went and closed the windows of heaven, so that the prayer of Manasseh should not reach God. God replied, \"If I do not accept him as a penitent, I shall lock the door before all who would repent.\" Then what did God do? He made an opening through the heavens under His Throne of Glory and heard Manasseh's supplication and received his entreaty, and brought him back to Jerusalem.",
      "commentary": "This myth emphasizes the power of repentance, even for those who have committed terrible sins. The mythical imagery found here is quite amazing— God makes an opening in heaven, reaches down and picks Manasseh up and carries him from Babylon to Jerusalem. A similarly surprising tradition about repentance is found concerning Cain. An encounter is reported in Genesis Rabbah 22:13 between Adam and Cain many years after Cain was punished. \"How did your case go?\" Adam asked. \"I repented and am reconciled, replied Cain. Hearing thus, Adam struck his face, crying, \"So great is the power of repentance, and I did not know!\" Then he arose and exclaimed. It is a good thing to make confession unto the Lord (Ps. 92:1).",

      "title": "The Ba'al Shem Tov Ascends On High",
      "content": "On Rosh ha-Shanah of 5507 [1746] the Ba'al Shem Tov made an adjuration, pronounced a holy name, and ascended on high. In the vision that followed, he saw wondrous things that he had never seen before, and he learned things that words cannot express. First he reached the Garden of Eden, where the souls of the righteous pass on their way to Paradise. There he saw many souls, some known to him and some unknown, and he discovered that it was a special time of grace. Many wicked people had repented, and their sins had been forgiven. It was wondrous for him to see how many were accepted as penitents. They were in a state of great rapture, and were about to ascend on high. All of them entreated the Ba al Shem Tov to ascend with them, to be their guide, and because of their great joy, he resolved to ascend together with them. But he knew there were great dangers involved in ascending into the highest heavens, so he called upon his teacher, the prophet Ahijah, to accompany him. All of them entered the column in the Garden of Eden that serves as a path to Paradise and began their ascent. As they journeyed on high, the Ba'al Shem Tov led those souls through the hidden palaces of heaven, one after another. All the mysteries of heaven are concealed in those palaces, as well as all the treasuries of heaven. The Ba al Shem Tov rose from rung to rung until he reached the palace of the Messiah in the highest heaven. There the Messiah teaches Torah with all the sages and saints and the Seven Shepherds. They greeted him with such great rejoicing that he was afraid that his soul had taken leave of the world, but they assured him that the time had not come for his soul to depart from his body. At last he asked the Messiah, \"When will my Master come?\" And the Messiah replied, \"When your teachings are known in the world, and others are capable of ascending on high like you.\"",
      "commentary": "This account, from a famous letter attributed to the Ba'al Shem Tov (ca. 1700-1760), describes a heavenly ascent on Rosh ha-Shanah 5507 (September 1746). Rosh ha-Shanah! the New Year, is the traditional Day of Judgment when God decides people's fate. See \"The Book of Life and the Book of Death,\" p. 289. This letter was said to have been written by the Ba'al Shem Tov to his brother-inlaw, Rabbi Abraham Gershon of Kittov, when the latter was in the Land of Israel. It is one of the only examples of writings by the Ba'al Shem Tov. In Ben Porat Yosef, where the letter was first published, the author. Rabbi Yakov Yosef of Polnoye (1704-1784), stated that the Ba'al Shem Tov gave him the letter to deliver to his brother-in-law! Rabbi Gershon. But Rabbi Yakov Yosef was unable to make the journey to the Holy Land, and therefore the letter remained with him. This indicates the authenticity of the letter. One of the Ushpizin, as the Seven Shepherds are known, is said to visit a righteous man s sukkah on each of the nights of Sukkot — if properly invited. There are varying lists of the identities of the Seven Shepherds. According to Micah 5:4 and B. Sukkah 52b, they are Adam, Seth, Methuselah, David, Abraham, Jacob, and Moses. According to the Zohar (3:103b-104a), they are Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, together with Moses, Aaron, and Joseph, plus King David. The Ba'al Shem Tov does not specify the names of the Seven Shepherds he encounters, but they are likely to be the list of those found in the Zohar , where Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron and Joseph each represent one of the sefirot from Hesed to Yesod. See \"The Seven Shepherds,\" p. 299. For another narrative of a heavenly ascent by the Ba'al Shem Tov, see \"Unlocking the Gates of Heaven\" in Gabriel's Palace , pp. 205-207.",

      "title": "The Unfinished Corner Of Creation",
      "content": "All of Creation had been completed except for the northern comer of the world. God began to create it, but left it unfinished, saying, \"Whoever declares himself to be God, let him come and finish this corner, and then all shall know he is a god.\" There, in that unfinished corner, demons, winds, earthquakes, and evil spirits dwell, and from there they come forth to the world, as it is said. From the north shall disaster break loose (Jer. 1:14). When the Sabbath departs, great bands of evil spirits set out from there and roam the world. Because of the cold north wind, the north was identified as the abode of evil spirits. This myth explains why — because that part of creation is unfinished. Here God makes a challenge to those who assert that they are divinities. The true test for a divinity is the ability to create a world. So God left one comer of the world unfinished, with the challenge that anyone who could finish it would indeed be a true god. Of course, the clear implication is that such a creation would be impossible. Rabbi Moshe Hayim Luzzatto offers a different perspective about unfinished creation: \"God began Creation but left it unfinished so that man could eventually bring it to completion\" (Adir ba-Marom). The Kotzker Rebbe said of this unfinished comer of creation: \"One little comer — God left one little corner in darkness so that we may hide in it!\"",

      "title": "The Darkness That Existed Before Creation",
      "content": "What happened to the darkness that existed before the creation of the world? Some say it is hidden in the seventh compartment of Gehenna. That compartment contains six nations of the world, but they cannot see each other on account of the darkness. The heretic Elisha ben Abuyah is said to reside there. The description of darkness found in Genesis, the earth being unformed and void , with darkness over the surface of the deep (Gen. 1:2), is quite ambiguous. Instead of stating that God created the darkness, the text seems to be saying that the darkness already existed — it was already upon the face of the deep. What is unclear is the meaning of darkness: whether it is to be understood as an absence of light, in the way that \"unformed and void\" suggests an absence. Or is darkness to be understood as a physical element, such as light? One possible answer to this question is given by Isaiah, who quotes God as saying, \"I form light and create darkness\" (Isa. 45:7). Here the difference depends on the word yotzer , \"forming,\" and borei, \"creating.\" The key here is that what God only forms, not creates, must have pre-existed. That, ultimately, may be the meaning of darkness was upon the face of the deep — the darkness was already there, a pre-existing element. This suggests a Gnostic view of the Creation, in which the Creator is something less than a supreme divinity. For another text with such Gnostic undertones, see \"Light from the Temple,\" p. 411.",

      "content": "The angel Dumah was the celestial Prince of Egypt. When Moses said that God would exercise judgment against the gods of Egypt, Dumah ran away four hundred parasangs. Then God said to him: \"It is My decree!\" And at that moment Dumah's power and dominion were taken away from him, and he was banished to the lower regions and appointed over the realms of Gehenna and the angels of destruction. Thus he' serves as judge of all the souls of the wicked. Dumah sees to it that the wicked are punished every day of the week, except for the Sabbath, when they are released. But at the close of the Sabbath Dumah casts their souls back into Gehenna, and their punishments begin anew.",
      "commentary": "This myth is clearly intended to parallel that of the fall of Lucifer. Just as Lucifer was an angel who rebelled against God and was cast out of heaven, so here the angel Dumah rebels upon learning that God planned to defeat Egypt, since Dumah is the celestial prince of Egypt. And just as Lucifer is identified with the Devil and said to rule in hell, so too is Dumah assigned to rule over Gehenna, Jewish hell. Other sources identify the prince of Gehenna as Arsiel. Midrash ha-Ne'elam in Zohar Hadash 25a-b describes Arsiel as standing before the souls of the righteous to prevent them from praying for the wicked before God. He demands that they also be placed under his dominion so that he can take them down to the netherworld, as it is said. Let me have the souls (Gen. 14:21). Although Lucifer's fall is rooted in Jewish sources, the myth was primarily taken up in Christian lore, and the myths of Lucifer and the Devil became merged into one. See \"The Fall of Lucifer,\" p. 108. Concerning the release of wicked souls on the Sabbath, see \"Sabbath in Gehenna,\" p. 238. For more on the angel Dumah, see \"The Punishments of Gehenna,\" p. 236. Because of his role as the angel in charge of Gehenna, Dumah is sometimes misidentified as the Angel of Death.",

This place is God's prison for rebellious stars and fallen angels. In it are seven stars burning like great mountains as they roll over the fire of the abyss. Because they did not come forth at their appointed times, God has bound them in that place for ten thousand years. There, too, are imprisoned the fallen angels who deceived mankind into making sacrifices to demons as if they were gods, and those who went astray with the daughters of men and defiled them. This bleak abyss, a kind of protohell, holds seven stars that transgressed God's command to come forth, as well as fallen angels who have been imprisoned.

Some say that he repented for a hundred and thirty years by standing in the River Gihon until the waters reached up to his neck, and he fasted until his body became as wrinkled as seaweed. Others say that female demons swarmed around Adam and inflamed him, until they succeeded in seducing him. In this way Adam begot mutant demons, both male and female, who were half human and half-demonic. At the same time, male demons were inflamed by Eve and seduced by her, and she too gave birth to a great many demons.",
      "commentary": "Some say it was Lilith, Adam's first wife, who found him alone and lay down by his side, and thus were begotten myriads of demons, spirits, and imps. Others say it was not Lilith, but her sister, Na'amah, who found Adam there. When God saw how Adam had turned away from Eve, He put desire for her back into Adam's heart. And when, at last, Adam and Eve were reunited, she bore Seth, who, unlike Cain, was the very image of Adam, as it is said, When Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years , he begot a son in his likeness after his image , and he named him Seth (Gen. 5:3). This strange legend about Adam being seduced by female demons, and Eve seducing male ones, grows out of the biblical verse When Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years , he begot a son in his likeness after his image , and he named him Seth (Gen. 5:3). Since the statement of the birth of Seth follows the mention of 130 years, the rabbis assumed that Adam must have withdrawn from Eve for that long. Various explanations are given for Adam's separation from Eve. Some attribute it to their expulsion from Eden and Adam's realization that death had been decreed against the world on his account, while other sources link it to Adam's grief over the death of Abel. There are also contradictory myths explaining what happened to Adam during the 130 years. One tells us that Adam repented by standing in the River Gihon, and the other assumes that his sexual desire was as great as ever, making him vulnerable to female demons, while male demons impregnated Eve. The demons that Adam and Eve give birth to are called mazikim. These mazikim and their demonic consorts account for the proliferation of demons. The Zohar (3:76b) attributes heavenly beauty to the daughters of Adam who were conceived in this way. The reference to Seth being in the image of Adam, and some texts say, the seed of Adam, while Cain was not, refers to the midrash that attributes Cain's conception to intercourse between Eve and the serpent, making Cain the son of the serpent. See \"The Seed of Cain,\" p. 448. This myth about Adam echoes the Greek myth of Tantalus, who was punished for his crimes by having to stand in a river up to his neck. There he is consumed by hunger and thirst. There is a nearby tree, with a branch he could reach, that bears every kind of fruit. But if he reaches for it, it pulls away. Likewise, he tries to drink from the river, but as soon as he reaches for it, the water subsides. From this punishment comes the term \"tantalize.\" Note that the Greek myth focuses the torment on food and water, while the Jewish myth focuses on sexual issues.

      "content": "From the crevice of the deep there came a certain evil female spirit whose name was Lilith. She had been condemned to imprisonment deep beneath the waves. But God's anger at the time of the Fall was so great that God decided to let Lilith go. So the dark Lilith, also known as the First Eve, was set free. She hides during the day in caves and other dark places. But at night she is free to roam the world. That is why it is written that a man may not sleep alone in a house, for Lilith will attempt to seduce him. She will slip in if the window is open a crack, slip beneath the door and beneath the sheets. Many a man has felt her long hair hanging in his face as he lay asleep, dreaming lustful dreams. After she steals his seed, Lilith gives birth to mutant demons, half human and half demon, who are destined to be outcasts. Humans will hate them, because they are half demon, and demons will hate them because they are half human. To lead the hearts of men astray, Lilith adorns herself with all manner of decorations, and stands at the entrance to roads and paths. She dresses for seduction, with earrings from Egypt and jewels hung around her neck. Her hair is long and red, her face white and pink, with six pendants hanging from her ears and all the ornaments of the East encircling her neck. Her mouth is like a tiny door, her lips beautiful, her words smooth as oil, and her tongue sharp as a sword. They will encounter her in a forest or a ruin, or in the cellar where an innkeeper takes his naps. One fool after another runs after her, drinks from her cup of wine, sleeps on her bed of Egyptian flax. And when he wakes up, thinking to sport with her, she takes off her finery and turns into a fierce warrior, her garment of flaming fire, her eyes horrific, and causes his body and soul to tremble, her sword sharpened with drops of poison. Then she kills him with a sharp sword from which bitter drops fall, and casts him into the very pit of hell.",
      "commentary": "This account of Lilith from the Zohar demonstrates how she is viewed as a murderous demon, who uses her sexual powers to destroy men. In the Zohar , Lilith is viewed as the primary feminine force of evil, while Samael is the primary male force. While in the Talmud (B. Eruvin 100b) Lilith is generally described as having long, black hair, there are other sources, such as this one, where her hair is described as red. Some sources even assert that Lilith has wings (B. Nidah 24b). This links Lilith even closer to the Babylonian night demonesses Lilitu and Lamashtu.",

      "content": "Lilith seeks, above all, to seduce the best ones, knowing that if she can conquer them, the others will fall into her hands as well. Once she decided to try to seduce Rabbi Elimelekh of Lizhensk. At that time Rabbi Elimelekh was still a young man. He spent all day in the house of study, and at night he walked home through the forest, always taking the same path. One night, as he was walking through the forest, he saw a light in the distance. Curious to know what it was, he left the path and followed the light. Before long he saw that it was coming from a cottage, one that he had never before seen in the forest. As he came closer, he peered into the window, and there he saw a woman with long, dark hair, who was wearing a very thin nightgown. As soon as he saw her, Reb Elimelekh knew he did not belong there, and he turned to leave. Just then the door to the cottage opened, and the woman called out: \"Reb Melekh, wait! Please, come in.\" So Reb Elimelekh went in. Then the woman closed the door and stood before him and said: \"Reb Melekh, I have seen you pass through the forest many times, and I have often hoped you would visit me. You know, I bathed in the spring today and I am clean. Surely the sin would be slight, but the pleasure would be abundant.\" And she dropped her gown. Reb Elimelekh stared at her with disbelief and struggled with himself, as did Jacob with the angel. And at last he wrenched out, \"No!\" At that instant the woman vanished, and the cottage disappeared, and Reb Elimelekh found himself standing alone in the forest. And there were glowworms at his feet. The woman in this tale is not identified, but everyone among the Hasidim who heard it knew exactly who she was — Lilith, or one of the daughters of Lilith. So vivid was the presence of Lilith in their lives that she became the primary projection of their sexual fantasies and fears. Lilith, as in this tale, is usually portrayed as having black hair. In fact she is characterized this way in the Talmud ( B . Eruvin 100b). She is brazen from the first, calling Reb Elimelekh not by his full name, Elimelekh, but by his familiar name, Melekh. This conveniently lets her avoid pronouncing Eli, \"my God,\" which, as a demoness, she is forbidden to do. The fact that her hair is long indicates that she is unmarried, while having bathed in the spring informs him that she has purified herself in a mikveh. She is appealing to his knowledge of the Law when she tells him that the sin will be slight and the pleasure abundant. According to Deuteronomy 22:22, If a man be found lying with a married woman, then they shall both die. However, the expected parallel about a married man lying with an unmarried woman is missing, and, according to rabbinic principles of interpretation, what is not stated is not a law. Therefore, the sin is slight, since the law does not identify it as adultery. It is a sin, but not a mortal one. Thus Lilith comes equipped with many weapons. She does not only use the power of lust, her greatest weapon, but also appeals to his intelligence. Rabbi Elimelekh escapes, but only after a considerable struggle. The glowworms at the end indicate that Lilith has lost her power over him and Lilith has been revealed in her true form, that of a worm. Or, if this story is read as a Hasidic sexual fantasy, that the fantasy has reached its climax. The fact that the tale is attributed to Reb Elimelekh of Lizhensk indicates that Lilith was brazen enough to approach even the holiest of men. Indeed, this was her intention. For if she could corrupt the best ones, the others would be sure to follow. Reb Elimelekh resists, but barely. The power of the Yetzer ha-Ra , the Evil Inclination, affects everyone on this earth, even rebbes. There is also a compensating force, the yetzer ha-tov , the Good Inclination. But, as might be expected, there is much more heard of the Yetzer ha-Ra in Jewish lore than there is of the Yetzer ha-Tov .",

      "content": "Every impurity engenders demons. Whenever a man's seed is spilled, his demon offspring are conceived. Lilith or one of the daughters of Lilith steals it. A drop is all that is needed. These demon sons regard the man as their father. They find a place to live in his house, whether in an attic or a cellar, or even in a closet. They make their home there. Not even married men are safe from the lure of Lilith. No sooner do their wives turn their backs, than Lilith seeks out victims among them. She appears to them in dreams during the night, and as visions during the day. Sometimes Lilith so sways a man that she becomes his secret wife. That is what happened in the city of Posen, where there once was a goldsmith who was secretly married to Lilith. The demoness lived in the cellar, where the goldsmith had his workshop. He spent time with his demon lover every day, while keeping her existence secret from his family. Little by little the goldsmith yielded everything to her, lusting after her day and night. Once it happened that the goldsmith even got up in the middle of the Seder, when the words \"And they went down into Egypt\" were read, and he went down to the cellar. His wife followed after him, afraid that he was ill. She peered through the keyhole of the cellar door, and saw that the cellar had been transformed into a palatial chamber, while her husband lay naked in the arms of a lover. Maintaining control of herself, she returned to the Seder and revealed nothing to the rest of the family. But the next day she went to the rabbi and told him everything. The rabbi confronted the man with his sin and he confessed. Then the rabbi gave him an amulet to protect himself against Lilith, and he used it to free himself of her. But before she would release him, Lilith demanded that the cellar be bequeathed to her and their demon offspring for all time, and the man took a vow to this effect. He escaped her powers all the rest of his life, but as he lay on his deathbed, his demon children swarmed around him, invisible to his human family, crying out his name. After his death the house became known as being haunted. Eventually it was sold, and the new owner had a workman break open the door to the cellar, which had been nailed shut. When that workman was found dead on the threshold. Rabbi Yoel Ba'al Shem was sent to investigate. He confirmed that the cellar was infested with demons, and he ordered a rabbinic court, a Beit Din, to be convened. The court ruled against the demons' right to live in the cellar there, on the grounds that the demons transgressed the boundaries of the cellar, and they were expelled into the wilderness. One of the most popular and pervasive beliefs in Jewish folk tradition is that the demoness Lilith or one of her daughters, the Lilin, seek to steal a man's seed, in order to create a demon who is half-human and half-demon. These demonic sons are said to haunt their fathers all their lives. The struggle portrayed in this and other similar tales can be seen as one between humans and demons, with offspring who are half-human, half-demonic — or, as a struggle between Jews and Gentiles, where Jewish men are lured by Gentile women, and their offspring are half-Jewish, half-Gentile. In both cases the offspring are spumed by both sides. Lilith plays a major role in Jewish lore as the incarnation of lust. She haunts men in their dreams and imaginations. Every time a man had a sexual dream or fantasy, he was believed to have had intercourse with Lilith, and the product of this intercourse were mutant demons, half human and half demon, who were spurned by humans and by demons alike. The story recounted here is a famous 17th-century folktale from the ethical text Kav ha-Yashar.",

      "content": "Lilith, the Queen of Zemargad, has the form of a beautiful woman from the head to the navel, and from the navel down she is flaming fire. Her only intention is to arouse wars and all kinds of destruction. It was she who seized and killed the sons of Job. Her lovers include Samael and Ashmedai, the King of Demons. Indeed, great jealousy sprang up between the demons Samael and Ashmedai over Lilith. When God brings about the destruction of Rome, and turns it into a ruin for all eternity, He will send Lilith there, and let her dwell in that ruin, for she is the ruination of the world, as it is said. And Lilith shall repose there (Isa. 34:14). Just as the sirens in Greek mythology are destructive female creatures, half-woman and half-bird, so Lilith is described here as being half-woman, half-fire. This description serves a dual purpose. On the one hand it shows that she is not a real woman, but some kind of strange creature, and the fire that makes up her lower half symbolizes the fires of desire that she awakens and that her role is directly related to lust. In Jewish folklore, Lilith is identified as the Queen of Demons and is said to be married to Ashmedai, the King of Demons. In this myth, where the view of Lilith is entirely negative, she is viewed as a destructive creature who provokes nothing but lust and jealousy. Even her demon lovers, Samael and Ashmedai, fight over her. But, the myth promises, the day will come when, like Rome, Lilith will receive her just punishment and be forced to live in a ruin, since she has ruined so many lives.

      "content": "Some say there are two Liliths. One is the spouse of Samael and the other is the spouse of Ashmedai. On Yom Kippur the two Liliths go forth into the desert and screech. And when the two meet there, they quarrel in the desert, and they strive with each other until their voices rise up to heaven, and the earth shakes with their clamor. God sees that this takes place so that the two Liliths should not accuse Israel while Israel is at prayer on Yom Kippur. Kabbalistic texts identify two Liliths, one sometimes known as Grandmother Lilith the Great and the other as Little Lilith. Mythic speculation about two Liliths grows out of two separate traditions about Lilith, one linking her to the demon Samael, and the other linking her to Ashmedai, the King of Demons. One of Lilith's specialties is to distract men while they are at prayer with lascivious thoughts. Here God sees to it that Lilith cannot distract Israel on Yom Kippur by sending the two Liliths out into the desert, where they screech and struggle with each other.",
      "commentary": "This myth of the two Liliths being sent out into the desert on Yom Kippur seems to be parallel to that of the scapegoat sent out into the desert to Azazel on Yom Kippur (Lev. 16:20-22). See \"A Scapegoat for Azazel,\" p. 295. But it replaces the male demon of the biblical myth— Azazel— with a female demon, Lilith. And instead of the scapegoat being sent to Azazel, the two Liliths are sent out to quarrel and screech at each other, distracting them and thus preventing them from accusing the people of Israel on the Day of Atonement. See \"The Ba'al Shem Tov Ascends on High,\" p. 209 for another example of the theme of silencing the Accuser. A parallel mythic development is found in the myth of the two Messiahs, Messiah ben Joseph and Messiah ben David. See \"The Two Messiahs,\" p. 517.",

Once Hurmin had two mules saddled and stood them on two bridges of the Rognag River. As Rabbah watched, Hurmin jumped back and forth from one to the other, holding two glasses of wine in his hand, pouring wine from one to the other, without spilling a drop. When the king of Mehuza heard about Hurmin's stunts, he had him executed, for the king feared that Hurmin would try to depose him. As for Lilith's daughters, they are just as dangerous as she is.

      "content": "At night Lilith flies over homes until she smells the odor of mothers' milk. She finds a way to enter the house — any kind of crack in the door or window will do. She can take any form she desires, a black cat, a broom, even a hair in the milk. Some say she comes there to strangle the infant, others that she wants to steal the afterbirth, to feed it to her children. Only if the child is guarded by an amulet against Lilith will the child be safe. But Lilith's greatest enemy was the old midwife who was familiar with all her tricks. It is told that Lilith, flying over the house of a woman who had recently given birth, smelled the mother's milk and transformed herself into a long, black hair that fell into a glass of milk. When the mother was about to drink the milk, she noticed the black hair and fainted. The midwife recognized the presence of Lilith at once and poured the glass of milk, hair and all, into a jug, and closed it tightly. Shaking the jug, the midwife heard the pleas of Lilith from within and extracted a vow from her not only to spare the woman and her child, but also to serve them for three years and protect them from other evil forces. This Lilith did, for once she takes an oath, she is compelled to carry it out. Note that the portrait of Lilith in the story of the midwife is quite different from that found in the male myths. The male attitude toward Lilith mixes fear with sexual fantasy. From a woman's perspective, however, Lilith is bad news in every way, as Lilith threatens to steal both her husband's affection and seed and the very life of her children. (It is important to contrast this traditional view of Lilith as an evil demoness with the contemporary view, espoused by Jewish feminists, that Lilith be viewed as a role model for sexual and personal independence. See footnote 172 in the Introduction.) Thus Lilith holds far more power over men than she does over women. Perhaps",
      "commentary": "this is because men are ambivalent toward Lilith, seeing her as something forbidden and tempting, while fearing her destructive abilities. For women, Lilith is a husbandstealing, child-destroying witch they fear and loathe more than anything else. And unlike the men, they are willing to struggle against her, here defeating her. The story of the midwife who captures Lilith is Kurdish. Professor Dov Noy suggests that this is a prime example of a woman's tale, containing secrets of how to defeat the enemy, Lilith.

      "title": "Lilith Flees From The Apparition Of Eve",
      "content": "When God created Adam, he attached Eve to Adam's back. Her beauty was like that of the realms above. Some say she was only an apparition, for she had not been brought into being, while others say that she was Adam's other half, until God separated them, creating two beings where there had been one. Once Lilith approached Adam, seeking to seduce him, for she thought that he was all alone. But when she saw Eve's perfect image attached to Adam's back, Lilith flew from there to the cherubim who guard the gates of the Garden of Eden. But the cherubim turned her away, and God dispatched her to the depths of Cities of the Sea. There Lilith dwelt until Adam and Eve sinned. Then God freed her from the watery depths and let her roam to and fro in the world. She returned to the cherubim and dwelt there by the fiery ever-turning sword that guards the way to the Tree of Life (Gen. 3:24).",
      "commentary": "Some say that she still bides her time there until the moon is on the wane and the light diminishes. Then she comes forth from the gates of the Garden and flies through the world seeking revenge against the children of Eve. But others say that God has exiled her once again to the Cities of the Sea, and that she will remain there until Rome is destroyed. Then God will bring Lilith from the depths and settle her in Rome's desolate ruins. This myth is a good example of how the Zohar takes an existing midrash and transforms it into a kabbalistic one. The midrash on which this myth is based ( B . Eruv. 14a) describes Adam and Eve as having been created back to back. That image recurs here (Zohar 1:19b), but it seems to suggest that rather than being a flesh and blood creature. Eve is more of an apparition, a perfect image. This interpretation grows out of the verse In the image of God He created him , male and female He created them (Gen. 1:27). Tzelem, the word for \"image,\" has many mystical meanings. Here it seems to suggest that Eve is more of an archetype than a person. Lilith is intimidated by this vision, either because she realizes that Adam is already with another woman, or because Eve's supernal beauty (which is, after all, that of the image of God) so greatly transcends her own. Gershom Scholem suggests that tzelem is a kind of astral body (On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead , pp. 251-273). Then the myth recounts that Lilith flees to the cherubim, who guard the gates of the Garden of Eden (Gen. 3:24). Her reasons for seeking out the cherubim are not clear, but it is possible that she, too, wanted a human body In any case, the cherubim guarding the gates of Eden turn her away and God imprisons her in the depths of the sea. But Adam's sin causes God to set her free, and she comes as close as she can to the Garden of Eden— still, it seems, desiring entry there— while using the night to seek harm against human infants, which, it is implied, is her revenge against Eve. Zohar 3:19a describes Eve as being fastened to Adam's side, rather than his back, at the time that God breathes the breath of life into him, and this living soul pervades his body. In both of these sources from the Zohar it seems that the female plays a role similar to that defined by Carl Jung as the anima, the feminine side of a man, whose presence must be discovered and integrated in order for a man to achieve wholeness. Eventually, however, God splits Adam and prepares Eve as an independent person (Zohar 3:19a). Here \"prepares\" can be understood as transforming Eve from her image into a living person, or, more closely following the midrashim about the wedding of Adam and Eve, preparing her as a bride for Adam. Or both, for this same passage from the Zohar also states that the reason Lilith fled was that she saw God bringing Eve to Adam, dressed as a bride (Gen. 2:22). Kabbalistic cosmology offers an entirely different way of viewing this myth of Lilith and Eve. Here Lilith represents not a demoness, but the whole side of evil in the Sitra Ahra, \"the Other Side,\" the domain of dark emanations and demonic power. Eve, likewise represents the world of holiness. See \"Adam the Hermaphrodite,\" p. 138, and \"The First Wedding,\" p. 143.",

      "content": "God created all day long during the first six days of Creation and did not rest until the sun set on the sixth day. But when the Sabbath day was ready to be sanctified, there were still spirits that had been created who were left without a body. Thus their creation was incomplete, and they are blemished. The holy name does not dwell in them. That is why demons have no bodies, but are composed entirely of spirit. Some of these evil spirits tried to enter the body of Adam after God shaped him into the form of a human being, but before God breathed the breath of life into him. These spirits continue to exist in the realm of spirits, whirlwinds, and demons known as the Sitre Ahra , the Other Side. They are made corporeal in that realm, the realm of Cain. It is said that these spirits have three things in common with the angels, and three things in common with men. Like angels, they have wings, they fly from one end of the world to the other, and they know the future, for they hear it spoken from behind the heavenly curtain ( Pargod ). Like humans, they eat and drink, they propagate, and they die. Likewise, in three ways demons are like human beings, and in three ways they are like the angels. Like humans they eat and drink, reproduce and multiply, and die. In addition, they are said to have the feet of cocks, they can change their appearance any time they please, and they see, but they cannot be seen. If you want to discover demons, take sifted ashes and sprinkle them around your bed, and in the morning you will see something like the footprints of a cock. If you want to see them, take the afterbirth of a black she-cat, the firstborn of a firstborn, roast it in fire and grind it to powder, and then put some in your eye and you will see them. This is a myth about the origin of evil spirits, which are said to have been created during the six days of creation with the intention of pairing them with bodies, but when the sun set on the sixth day of creation, there were many spirits left without bodies. These spirits are linked with the Sitra Ahra, the Other Side. They are regarded as unclean, and dwell in the realm of evil, or wander restlessly around the world.

They could not harm King Solomon, or the chief builder, so Omasis, a vampire demon, approached the chief builder's son and sucked blood from his thumb. He did this many times, until the boy was very weak. King Solomon noticed his condition, and asked him what was wrong. When the boy told the king, Solomon gave the boy his royal ring, with the letters of God's Name, YHVH, engraved on it, and told the boy to throw the ring at the demon the next time he approached. That would make him the boy's prisoner. When that happened, the boy was to bring him to King Solomon. That is exactly how things came to pass, and before long King Solomon besieged Omasis with many questions about the other demons, what their names were, and how they could be stopped. In this way. King Solomon extracted the names of all the demons. And with the knowledge he gained, Solomon saw the building of the Temple completed, and held off the demons throughout the years he ruled, for they had no power over him.",

Among them was a demoness whose name was Onoskelis. Her torso was that of a beautiful woman, but her legs were those of a mule. Solomon said, \"Tell me who you are.\" She replied, \"I am Onoskelis, a spirit that has been made into a body. I was created by the echo of a voice from a black heaven. I make my home in caves in the sides of cliffs and ravines. I travel by the moon. Sometimes I strangle men, sometimes I pervert them from their true nature, for men think of me as a woman, which I am not. Men worship me secretly and openly and this incites me to be an evildoer all the more.\" Then King Solomon uttered God's name and commanded her to spin hemp for the ropes used to build the Temple in Jerusalem. He had her bound in a such a way that she was powerless, so that she had to stand day and night to spin the hemp. The Testament of Solomon serves as a comprehensive listing of demons and spirits. King Solomon invokes and then interrogates them. Here he invokes the spirit of an evil demoness, Onoskelis, who seduces and strangles men. She is a Lilith-like figure, but there are some distinct differences. While Lilith demonstrates seductive beauty entirely, Onoskelis has a beautiful torso but the legs of a mule. Like Lilith, she deceives men into believing she is a woman, when she is actually a demoness set on their destruction. Solomon's punishment for her is like that of a fairy tale— she must endlessly spin hemp. This, of course, keeps her occupied, and forces her to contribute to the building of the Temple.",

      "commentary": "This myth from 1 Enoch , dating from around the second century bce to the first century ce, identifies the place of the dead as Sheol, as does the Bible. Later Sheol is replaced by Gehenna, Jewish hell, where the souls of the dead are punished and purified. This myth demonstrates that even after death the spirits of those who have been murdered continue to plead their case against their murderers. This belief can be traced to the verse Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground (Gen. 4:10), confirming the belief that such terrible deeds can never go unpunished. Also standing behind this myth is the concept of the seed of Abel and the seed of Cain. These are the descendants of Cain and Abel (or, in Abel's case, the descendants of Seth since Abel had no descendents that we know of), in whose blood the conflict is carried on. And the spirit of Abel will not be satisfied until all of the descendants of Cain— traditionally identified as the enemies of the Jews — will be annihilated.",

Then the soul of the man who has died is brought before the patriarchs and they say to him, \"My son, what have you done in the world from which you have come?\" If he answers, \"I have bought fields and vineyards, and I have tilled them all my life,\" they say, \"Fool that you have been! Have you not learned that The earth is the Lord's and all that it holds\" (Ps. 24:1). Angels then take him away and hand him over to theavenging angels, who thrust him into Gehenna. Then angels bring another before the patriarchs. They ask the same question, and if he answers, \"I gathered gold and silver,\" they reply, \"Fool, have you not read in the books of the prophets, Silver is Mine and gold is Mine— says the Lord of Hosts (Hag. 2:8).

Meanwhile, the Prince of Gehenna stands before the righteous, saying, \" Give me the souls \" (Gen. 14:21). In this way he does his best to distract the righteous, so that they will not pray for the wicked. For the Prince of Gehenna knows only too well the power of their prayers. Several figures are identified as the Prince of Gehenna — the angel in charge of the souls of the wicked, who are being punished in Gehenna. Among them, Satan is the best known angel, along with Samael. The demon Ashmedai is said to rule the Kingdom of Demons. The Prince of Darkness is another name that is used. Here the Prince of Gehenna is identified as the angel Arsiel, who plays the satanic role of confronting the souls of the righteous to distract them from praying for the souls of the wicked. Then, when God gives the order, he takes them down to Gehenna. Note that God is at the head of the chain of the orders that send the wicked to the netherworld. All that remains to save the wicked from their fate are the prayers of the righteous. But they are a potent force.

Then there are those who say that the mouth of Gehenna can be found anywhere in the world, and should it be needed, the mouth opens and swallows whatever is standing there. Various sources describe different entrances to Gehenna, and this myth attempts to resolve the contradictions by stating that Gehenna has three entrances. An alternate explanation suggests that the entrance to Gehenna can be found anywhere, and that the ground can open up and swallow a sinner, just as it did for Korah and his followers when they challenged Moses in Numbers 16:32.

The tortures of Gehenna are myriad, and nothing is as it seems.

When Rabbah did, he heard them crying out, \"Moses and the Torah are true, and we were liars!\" The Bedouin told Rabbah that every thirty days the angel appointed over the sinners of hell brings them to this place, where they are roasted by the fire. And all the while they cry out in regret over what they have done.",
      "commentary": "This is one of the tall tales attributed to Rabbah bar Bar Hannah found in the Talmud. Here a Bedouin takes him to the place where Korah and his followers were swallowed up by the earth after they rebelled against Moses in Numbers 16:32. The place they fall into is Gehenna, where evil souls are punished. Once a month Gehenna returns to that place. This regularity echoes Rabbah's tale about the same Bedouin leading him to the Wheel of Heaven, which returns to the same place every 24 hours. The moral of this myth is quite apparent: Korah and his followers are still crying out in regret for their rebellion against Moses, which will haunt them forever. See \"Where Heaven and Earth Meet,\" p. 121 and \"The Dead of the Desert,\" p. 471.",

He shall sling away the lives of your enemies as from the hollow of a sling (1 Sam. 25:29). This brief myth presents a stark contrast between the fates of the souls of the righteous and those of the wicked. While those of the righteous are kept close by, beneath God's throne, those of the wicked experience the punishment of wandering and exile, traditionally the worst possible punishment. This is the same punishment Cain receives when God makes him a ceaseless wanderer on earth (Gen. 4:11). But most startling is the image of the angels standing at each end of the world, throwing the souls of the wicked back and forth. This emphasizes how relentless is the wandering they are condemned to, which takes on characteristics of one of the punishments of Gehenna, Jewish hell.

Their names are Mashit, Af, and Hema, and they command many legions of avenging angels. All of Gehenna is filled with their din, and their shouts reach into heaven. That is why the voices of the wicked can barely be heard as they shriek out, and why no one has mercy upon them. Every night, except the Sabbath, the angels of destruction punish those whose evil deeds were hatched in the dark. There the wicked learn firsthand why the dread of Gehenna is so great. But when the Sabbath begins, judgment vanishes from the world and the wicked in Gehenna rest. The angels of destruction cease ruling over them from the moment the Sabbath arrives, until the Sabbath comes to an end. Then the wicked are dragged back to the dungeons of Gehenna, where their punishment resumes. It is said that in the future all the people of Israel will enter Gehenna together with the nations of the world, and the latter will all perish, while Israel will depart from its midst unharmed, as it is said. When you walk through fire, you shall not be scorched; through flame, it shall not bum you (Isa. 43:2).",

      "content": "Even the wicked in Gehenna enjoy a respite on the Sabbath. Every Sabbath eve, when the day becomes sanctified, the angel in charge of souls announces, \"Let the punishment of the sinners cease, for the Holy King approaches and the Day is about to be sanctified. He protects all!\" Instantly all punishment ceases, and the guilty have a respite. The sinners who observed the Sabbath are led to two mountains of snow, where they remain until the end of the Sabbath, when the angel in charge of the spirits shouts, \"All evildoers, back to Gehenna — the Sabbath is over!\" and they are thrust back to their former place in hell. Some of them, however, take snow with them to cool them during the six days of the week, but God says to them: \"Woe to you who steal even in hell!\" But the fires of Gehenna do not come to a halt for those who never observed the Sabbath. Since they did not observe the Sabbath before, they have no respite. An angel whose name is Santriel, which means \"God is my Guardsman,\" goes and fetches the body of the sinner from the grave. He brings it to Gehenna before the eyes of the guilty, and they see how it has bred worms. They know the soul of such a sinner has no respite from the fire of Gehenna. And all those guilty who are there surround that body and proclaim over it: \"This person is guilty, for he would not regard the honor of his Master, he denied the Holy One, blessed be He, and denied the Torah. Woe to him! It had been better for him never to be created and not to be subjected to this punishment and this disgrace!\" Rabbi Yehudah said: \"After the Sabbath goes out the angel comes and takes that body back to its grave, and both the body and the soul are punished, each in its own way.\" And all this takes place while the body is still well preserved. But once the body is decayed, it no longer suffers all these punishments. The guilty ones are punished in their bodies and their souls, each with a suitable punishment, so long as the body in the grave is intact. But when the body breaks down the punishment of the soul ceases. He who must leave Gehenna leaves, and he who must find rest has rest — to each is done what is suitable for him. So great is the redeeming power of the Sabbath, that even the souls being punished in Gehenna are allowed to rest on the Sabbath, until the close of the Sabbath. As Tola'at Ya'akov puts it, \" Din — harsh justice — is banished on the eve of the Sabbath, even from the sinners in Gehenna. For the Sabbath protects the cosmos. But on Saturday night Din is restored to its station. A herald cries out: ' Let the wicked be in SheoY \" (Ps. 9:18). In addition to a reprieve on the Sabbath, Zohar 2:150b lists further reprieves on new moons and festivals. For a folktale about Sabbath in Gehenna, see \"Three Stars\" in Gabriels Palace , pp. 227-228.

For even though God finished creating the world and rested from His work on the seventh day, yet He continues to ordain punishment for the wicked, and to bestow rewards upon the righteous. The point of this myth about Gehenna is that there will always be room for more sinners — God will see to that.

The three ministers of Gehenna, Kipod, Nagdasniel, and Samael, are in charge of these three gates. Gehenna itself is filled with the dwellings of demons. Among the inhabitants are harmful demons and destructive spirits, as well as many hosts of avenging angels. There the wicked are punished in the seven circles of Gehenna. Avenging angels lead wraithlike beings to the gates, whipping them onward. When they reach one of the gates of Gehenna, an angel strikes the gate with his fiery whip so that it swings open.

Perhaps the bestknown version is that found in the fairy tale \"Bluebeard.\" Such a door becomes an emblem for all taboos, reminding us of Eve's plucking of the forbidden fruit or of the Greek myth of Pandora. In the Talmud, Paradise and Gehenna are said to be as close as three fingerbreadths, implying that it is very easy to sin, and that the door to Gehenna confronts us at every turn. For a Jewish folktale based on this motif, see \"The Door to Gehenna\" in Lilith's Cave , pp. 64-70. For more on the punishments of Gehenna see Hell in Jewish Literature by Samuel J.

Avenging angels drag the souls of sinners to Gehenna, and the gatekeeper makes sure that they deserve to be punished there. Samriel is appointed over the three gates of Gehenna that are found on the side of the wilderness. He has the keys for these three gates, and when he opens them, the light of the world seeps in. Samriel has three angels under him, with three shovels, who clear a path out of Gehenna so that the light of the world can enter and be seen by the inmates of Gehenna. Once in a while a sage or rabbi descends to Gehenna in order to obtain a bill of divorce from one of the souls being punished there. But the gatekeeper turns them all away, all except for Rabbi Naftali Katz. When Rabbi Naftali came there on a mission, the angel guarding the gate of Gehenna looked for his name in the Book of Gehenna, and refused to admit him when it wasn't there. Rabbi Naftali threatened to take a vow to remain there for eternity and to pester the angel until he let him in. So the angel let him in. The only ones permitted into Gehenna are the sinners who are brought there for punishment. However, there are a number of stories about sympathetic rabbis who attempted to enter Gehenna to ease the suffering of the sinners there. This myth explains that there is an angel, Samriel, who guards the entrance of Gehenna in order to keep out anyone who does not belong. In the story \"Rabbi Naftali's Trance,\" Rabbi",

      "content": "When Rabbi Joshua ben Levi found himself in the Garden of Eden, he decided to explore it as completely as he could. One by one he explored the nine palaces of the Garden of Eden, until he came to the palace of the Messiah. He recognized the Messiah by the splendor of his aura. There he saw how the patriarchs and kings came to the Messiah every Sabbath and holy day and wept, because it was not yet time for him to go forth into the world. When Rabbi Joshua came before the Messiah, the Messiah said, \"How are my children faring?\" And Rabbi Joshua said: \"Every day they await you.\" Then the Messiah gave a great sigh and wept. After that the Messiah showed Rabbi Joshua all of the earthly garden and the heavenly one as well, and revealed the greatest mysteries to him. But when Rabbi Joshua asked to be shown hell, at first the Messiah refused, for the righteous are not permitted to behold hell. But when Rabbi Joshua told him that it was his intention to measure hell from beginning to end, the Messiah agreed to take him there. So it was that Rabbi Joshua followed the Messiah until they reached the fiery gates of hell. When the angels guarding the gate saw that the Messiah was with him, they admitted him at once. Everywhere they went. Rabbi Joshua saw the punishments of hell, where avenging angels smite the wicked with flaming rods, and throw them into fiery pits, and after that hang them by their tongues, or by the organs with which they committed adultery. And although Rabbi Joshua tried to measure the compartments of hell, he found that they were boundless, as was the suffering of the wicked. But whenever the wicked in hell saw the light of the Messiah, they rejoiced and cried out, \"There is the one who will bring us out of here.\"",
      "commentary": "This myth about the descent of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi and the Messiah into hell builds on the talmudic account of Rabbi Joshua's highly irregular entrance into the Garden of Eden. See \"Rabbi Joshua ben Levi and the Angel of Death,\" p. 206. There Rabbi Joshua is portrayed as fearless, and here he asks the Messiah, whom he meets in heaven, to show him hell. The Messiah finally agrees and they descend to Gehenna together. Rabbi Joshua tries to measure the compartments of Gehenna, but discovers that they are boundless, i.e., that they can contain any number of sinners. However, this visit serves to give hope to the sinners of Gehenna, who acclaim the Messiah as the one who will free them from there, since one of the traditions about the coming of the Messiah is that all those being punished in Gehenna will be raised from there to Paradise. The Messiah described here is Messiah ben David, the celestial Messiah, who lives in a heavenly palace and will only descend to earth when the time is right for the footsteps of the Messiah to be heard.",

However, this one seems to assume that all of the spirits of the dead are in a Hades-like place where they are kept during the week, not necessarily Gehenna, but more like Sheol. Although it is vague on this point, the central focus of the myth, on the resurrection of all of the dead of Israel every Sabbath, is memorable and unique.

And you shall trample the wicked to a pulp, for they shall be dust beneath your feet (Mai. 3:21). Then the righteous take pity on the fate of the sinners and they pray for mercy upon them, and say, \"Master of the Universe, these are the men who rose early to go to synagogue. They read the Shema, prayed, and performed other commandments.\" Hearing this, God revives them out of the ashes and stands them upon their feet and brings them to life in the World to Come. For most sinners the punishments of Gehenna are only supposed to last for up to 12 months. After that, their souls have been purified, and they are able to slowly ascend on high, through the seven heavens. What is amazing about this myth of sinners being burned to ashes is that their revival comes about because the righteous intercede for them. Of course, the notion of the sinners in Gehenna being burned to ashes is highly punitive. But the myth also includes an example of righteousness and generosity on the part of the just, whose prayers make it possible for those burned to ashes to be restored for life in the world to come.

      "content": "The day a person dies is the day of his judgment, when the soul parts from the body. A person does not leave this world until he sees the Shekhinuh , accompanied by three ministering angels, who receive the soul of a righteous person. These angels examine a person's deeds, and insist that a person confess to all that the body has done with the soul in this world. After this confession, the soul of a righteous person rejoices in its parting from this world and looks forward with delight to the world to come. For when God takes the souls of the righteous. He takes it with gentleness. But when He takes the souls of the wicked. He does so through cruel angels, as it is said, Therefore a cruel angel shall be sent against him (Prov. 17:11). After a man dies he can be seen by all the others who are dead. To each of them he appears as they last saw him alive: some see him as a youth, others as an old man. For the angel who guards the dead makes his soul assume these various forms so that all should recognize him by seeing him just as they saw him in life. However, if a man is condemned to punishment in Gehenna, he is enveloped in smoke and brimstone, so that none of those being punished can see the punishment of any other. Thus none are put to shame, except for those who have put others to shame. This description of a man seeing the Shekhinah as he dies is based on Exodus 33:20: No man shall see Me and live. The three angels who accompany the Shekhinah are identified as the three angels who visited Abraham in Genesis 18:2. It is characteristic of Jewish myth to describe in great detail unknown realms, such as heaven, hell, or what comes to pass when a person leaves this life. Here the dead are said to see each other exactly as they appeared when they last saw each other alive. This explanation of how the dead see and recognize each other solves the problem of a person's changing appearance by aging.",

It was no wearisome labor for God, whose word came into being at the instant it was spoken. When God told the heavens to continue to spread out, they went on expanding, as it is said. Who spread out the skies like gauze, stretched them out like a tent to dwell in (Isa. 40:22). Indeed, if God had not said: \"Enough!\" they would have gone on expanding until the end of time. This creation myth presents a variant of Genesis 1:3, where God said \" Let there be light/' and there was light. Here, too, the world is created through speech. God is said to have spoken a word, and the world came into being. Here, however, another word is required to stop the expansion of the heavens. This echoes the myth of the golem, a man made out of day, who, when told to bring water from the river, continues to bring barrels of water until the house is flooded, simply because no one told him to stop. The image of the world continuing eternally to expand suggests the modem theory of the Big Bang.",

      "commentary": "This myth postulates that God created two worlds at the time of the creation, this world, Olam ha-Zeh, and the Olam ha-Ba, the World to Come. Midrash Tehillim 62:1 links this myth of two worlds to the verse Truly my soul waits quietly for God (Ps. 62:2). It then adds, \"Know you upon whom you wait? Upon Him who created two worlds with the letters of His Name: with yod and heh He created worlds, this world and the World to Come.\" There is a rabbinic debate over which letter was used to create the two worlds. Midrash Tehillim 114:3 declares that no one is certain which letter was used for which creation. Other rabbinic sources view heaven and earth as a single world. Indeed, Genesis Rabbah 1:15 recounts a heated rabbinic discussion about which was created first, the heaven or the earth: \"The school of Shammai maintains that heaven was created first, while the school of Hillel maintains that earth was created first. In the view of Shammai, this is like a king who first made his throne and then made his footstool. Hillel compares it to a king who builds a palace — first he builds the foundation, then the upper portion. Hearing this. Rabbi Simeon said: 'I am amazed that the fathers of the world engage in controversy over this matter. Surely both were created at the same time, like a pot and its lid/\" Eliyahu Rabbah follows this pattern of simultaneous creation, asserting that God created the heavens and the earth at the same time, in their entirety, and gave them permanent form by shaping them. He gave them their finishing touch by hammering them out. In this way He made the earth fit to dwell in, while He stretched out the sky above it, as it is said. The heaven and the earth were finished (Gen. 2:1).",

It lay in God's bosom and sang praises of God along with the ministering angels. God wrote the Torah while seated on the Throne of Glory, high in the firmament above the heads of the celestial creatures. The Garden of Eden was at God's right hand, and Gehenna was at His left. The heavenly sanctuary was set up in front of Him, with the name of the Messiah engraved upon the altar. There, as the Torah rested on His knees, God wrote the letters in black fire on white fire. Later, it was tied to the arm of God, as it is said. Lightning flashing at them from His right (Deut. 33:2). Others say that the Torah was written on the arm of God, while still others say it was carved in fire on God's crown. The Torah was there when God created the heavens, drawing a circle on the face of the depths. So too was it there when God fashioned the heavens and set the streams into motion. The Torah was reared by God, and it was His daily joy, giving God great pleasure. Later Moses arose and brought it down to earth to give to humanity. Here the passage from Proverbs that is spoken by Wisdom is attributed to the Torah: Yahweh created me at the beginning of His course (Prov. 8:22). Thus Wisdom and the Torah are identified as the same figure, since the Torah is regarded as the sum of Jewish wisdom.",

      "title": "Creation By The Torah",
      "content": "The Torah was one of the seven things created before the creation of the world, and the Torah served as God's advisor when He was about to create this world. God looked into the Torah and created the world and all created beings through it. When the time came to create man, the Torah said, \"Master of the Universe, the world is Yours to create. The days of this man You want to create will be short and full of anger, and he will be drawn into sin. If You are not going to have patience with him, it's better for him not to be created.\" God answered, \"It's not for nothing that I'm called Merciful.\" After that God consulted only the Torah, and let the Torah serve as a blueprint for all creation. So too did the Torah serve as an artisan in all the work of creation. With the assistance of the Torah, God stretched out the heavens and established the earth. With the Torah He bound up the sea, lest it go forth and overflow the world. With the Torah He locked up the deep, so that it might not inundate the world. So too did He fashion the sun and moon with it. Thus we learn that the world was indeed founded upon the Torah, and that God created the world and all created beings through the Torah. How did God do this? He looked into the Torah and created the world with it. With every single act of creation, God looked into the Torah, and created that detail of creation. Others say that God fashioned the world according to the Torah. Looking at the word \"heavens,\" God created the heavens. Looking at the word \"light,\" He created light. So it went with each and every word of the Torah. In this way the world came into being. Still others say that God opened the Torah and took a name that had not been given to any creature, and let three drops of that name fall into the sea. Those drops became filled with water and with the Holy Spirit, for The spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters (Gen. 1:1). Thus the Shekhinah was present in that place. God opened the Torah again and took out a second name. This time God took three drops of light: one for the light of this world, one for the light of the World to Come , and one for the light of the Torah. For there is a holy light hidden in the Torah, and in order to discover it, it is necessary to probe deeply into the Torah, and one day the light of the Torah will shine forth. Then God opened the Torah for the third time, and took out three drops of fire, and from that fire the whole world is heated. God saw fire on His right, light on His left, and water beneath Him. He mixed them together two by two. He took fire and water and mixed them together, and made heaven out of them. So too did God take water and light and make a tent of darkness of them, as well as the Clouds of Glory. And out of fire and light God made the holy beasts. Thus not only was the Torah created prior to the creation of the world, it was the vessel by which the world was created. In this way the universe came into being through the letters of the Torah.",
      "commentary": "So too did God declare, at the time of man's creation, that the world was created only for the sake of the Torah, and that as long as the Jewish people occupy themselves with the Torah, the world will continue to exist. But if the Jewish people abandon the Torah, God will return all of creation to a state of chaos. God is able to consult the Torah because it is one of the seven things created before the creation. See \"Seven Things Created before the Creation,\" p. 74. A parable is given to explain God's use of the Torah to create the world: \"When a king wishes to build a palace, he does not build it himself but brings in an artisan. Nor does the artisan build it himself. He uses sketches and notebooks. So too did God look into the Torah and create the world.\" ( Genesis Rabbah 1:1). Here the Torah is presented as an \"artisan,\" not simply as a text to be consulted, while God is the architect, that is, an active, creating force. Here the Torah seems to participate in the creation in much the same way as the angels are said to have done in other rabbinic sources. See \"Creation by Angels,\" p. 116. In the second example of God creating the world from the Torah, found in Midrash Konen, God takes a name out of the Torah and transforms it into drops of water, light, and fire, the elements with which God creates the world. This myth provides the origin of the primordial elements with which God was able to create the world, having them find their origin in a name found in the Torah. Such a name or names, usually the name of an angel, is used to invoke various kinds of spells in the Jewish magical tradition. It makes the creation of those elements itself a step in the creation process, thus making it a part of God's overall plan. In this scenario, God created the Torah, which, in turn, was used to create the elements, which were used to create the world. This tradition probably emerged in response to the Gnostic view that the primordial elements— darkness, light, water, and fire— already existed when God decided to proceed with creation. Philo also offers the metaphor of God having used a blueprint in the creation of the world, but he does not identify this blueprint with the Torah, but rather with a blueprint in an architect's mind. Three types of light are reported to have been created in this myth: the light of this world (Olam ha-Zeh), the light of the World to Come (Olam ha-Ba), and the light of the Torah. Each one is created out of a word of the Torah, one that was not the name of any creature. The Zohar and later the Ba'al Shem Tov linked the light of the first day, known as the hidden light (or ha-ganuz), with the light of the Torah. Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, the greatest Jewish storyteller, added to this interpretation his view that the light could be found in the stories of the Torah. See \"The Light of the First Day,\" p. 83, and \"Light from the Temple,\" p. 411. According to Rabbi Hayim of Volozhin, the Torah did not actively participate in Creation, but nevertheless played an essential role: \"At the time of Creation, the Torah illuminated the universe from a remote distance to give it life and sustain it. Still, the world remained unsettled until the giving of the Torah 2000 years later\" (Nefesh ha-Hayim 4:1). The basis for the assertion that God will destroy the world if the Jewish people abandon the Torah is Jeremiah 33:25: \"If not for My Covenant , I would not have set day and night and the bounds of heaven and earth.\"",

Then, when God was about to create the world, all twenty-two letters engraved upon His crown came down and stood before him, from tav to aleph. The letter tav approached first and said: \"O Lord, create the world through me, for I am at the beginning of the word 'Torah.'\" God replied, “Tav, You are worthy and deserving, and in the days to come I shall command that you be put as a sign on the foreheads of the righteous, so that when the destroying angel comes to punish sinners, he will see the letter on their foreheads and spare them.\" But the letter tav was sad that it would not be used to create the world, and it left the presence of the Lord. Then, one by one, each of the other letters came forward and pleaded with God to create the world through them. But God did not grant their wish. Soon all that remained",

And each letter flashed over and over again like lightning. The world was created with the letter bet, because it stands for \"blessing,\" not with the aleph , which stands for \"curse.\" Others say that two worlds were created with two letters — the yod and the heh — this world and the World to Come. The account of creation opens with the letter bet (which serves as the number two) in order to teach that these two worlds exist. Bezalel, the architect of the tabernacle, knew how to combine the letters through which heaven and earth were created. There are a variety of traditions about how the world was created. \"Creation by Word,\" p. 247, suggests that the heavens and earth came into being as a result of God's speech. Here it is not the speech, but the letters of the words to which the power of creation is attributed. This myth also suggests that Bezalel, whose abilities as an architect were legendary, drew his power from knowing how to combine the letters that had been used to create the world. A similar tradition concerns the creation of the golem, the man made out of clay. The golem was said to have been brought to life through the letters of the word emet, which were inscribed on its forehead, and through the Tetragrammaton, the four-letter Name of God, inscribed on a piece of parchment, which was placed inside its mouth. See \"The Golem of Prague,\" p. 281.",

      "content": "Most people derive pleasure from eating and drinking, not from the light shining through the letters. The Tzaddik, however, derives no pleasure from eating or drinking or other bodily pleasures. Instead, he is renewed by the shining letters, and derives all his pleasure from them. For the letters of the holy tongue animate every object. And the Tzaddik, when reaching for an object, can actually grasp the letters within it. Basic kabbalistic doctrine holds that the interaction of the letters of a word is directly linked to what that word represents. Indeed, every object has at its essence the letters that make it up. Most people are oblivious to this inner truth, the letters glowing inside of every object. But the Tzaddikim—fae righteous ones— are well aware of these letters and are even able to grasp them. Here Rabbi Nachman expands, as he often does, on the remarkable spiritual insight of the Tzaddik.",

      "content": "Prior to the creation of the world, there were no animals, therefore there were no skins of parchment on which to write the Torah. How, then, was the Torah written? On the arm of God, with black fire on white fire. And God took the Torah and placed it before Him and gazed at it, and read it from beginning to end. And as He read those words, they came to pass.",
      "commentary": "While writing on parchment is not as ancient as writing on clay tablets, it was the method used to record the most ancient Jewish texts, and to this day possession of a parchment scroll of the Torah is considered a necessity for every Jewish congregation. Since there was a well-known tradition that the Torah was one of the seven things created before the rest of the world, this myth attempts to resolve the problem of where the Torah was written down before there were skins to use as parchment. The answer given is a surprising one — that it was written on the arm of God, and that God read it from where it was inscribed on His arm. This myth suggests how closely the Torah was associated with God, so much so that it was inscribed on His arm like a tattoo.",

      "content": "The Book was revealed to Adam while he was still in the Garden of Eden, to show him each generation and its sages, each generation and its leaders. How did God show him generations that did not yet exist? Some say that God cast sleep upon him and showed him, while others say that Adam saw them all with his eyes, for whatever he read in that book he saw with his own vision. For since the time the world was created, all of the souls of those yet to be bom stand before God in the very same form in which they will live in this world. God sent the angel Raziel, the Angel of Secrets, to read the Book to Adam. But when Adam heard the first words issue from the mouth of the angel, he fell down in fear. Therefore God let Raziel leave the Book with him so that he could read from it on his own, and in this way Adam came to know the future and was made wise in all things.",
      "commentary": "Some say that book was written on parchment, while others say it was engraved on a sapphire. How was that sapphire read? Adam held it up to his eyes, and the flame burning inside that sapphire took the form of the letters, so Adam could read them there. So too there are those who say that the true text of the Book of Raziel was the Torah, for the Torah was one of the seven things created before the rest of Creation, and this way its wisdom was transmitted even to the first man. Contained in the Book was a secret writing that explained seventy-two branches of wisdom, mysteries which had not been revealed even to the other angels. So too did the Book contain the entire history, past and future, of mankind. Whenever Adam opened the Book, angels gathered around him to learn all the mystical secrets it contained. Then the angels made a plea to God, saying, \"Impart the mystery of Your glory to the angels, not to men.\" Instead, the angel Hadamiel was secretly sent to Adam and said: \"Adam, Adam, do not reveal the glory of your Master, for to you alone and not to the angels is the privilege given to know these mysteries.\" After that Adam kept the Book concealed, and read it in secret. In this way he learned mysteries not even known by the angels. But at last the envy of the angels became so great that they stole the Book and threw it into the sea. Adam searched for it in vain, and then fasted for many days, until a celestial voice announced: \"Fear not, Adam, I will give the Book back to you.\" Then God called upon Rahab, the angel of the sea, and ordered him to recover the Book from the depths of the sea and to give it to Adam, and so he did. When Adam transgressed, the Book flew away from him. But Adam begged God for its return, and beat his breast, and entered the river Gihon up to his neck, until his body became wrinkled and his face haggard. Then God made a sign for the angel Raphael, the Angel of Healing, to heal Adam and bring the book back to him. After that Adam studied the book intently, and bequeathed it to his son Seth. So it went on, through successive generations, as it is said. This is the book of the generations of Adam (Gen. 5:1). In this way the book was handed down from Seth to Enosh to Kenan to Jared, and in this way it reached Enoch. It was from this Book that Enoch drew his vast knowledge of the Mysteries of Creation. Before he was taken up into heaven and transformed into the angel Metatron, Enoch entrusted the book to his son, Methuselah, who read the Book and transmitted it to his son Lantech, and from there it reached Noah, Lamech's son, who made use of its instructions in building the ark. Indeed, there are those who insist that the book was revealed to Noah by the angel Raziel. They say that Noah heard the book from the mouth of Raziel and later the angel wrote it down for him on a sapphire stone. By reading this book it was possible for Noah to penetrate great secrets of knowledge, hierarchies of understanding, and ideas of wisdom, to know the way of life and the way of death, the way of good and the way of evil, and to foresee the concerns of each and every year, whether for peace or for war, for plenty or for hunger, for harvest or for drought. By gazing there the destinies of the stars were revealed, as well as the course of the sun and the names of the guardians of each and every firmament. Revealed as well were the secrets of how to interpret dreams and visions, and how to rule over all of a man s desires, as well as how to drive away evil spirits and demons. Happy was the eye that beheld that book, and happy the ear that listened to its wisdom, for in it were revealed all the secrets of heaven and earth. Noah placed the Book into a golden box and it was the first thing he brought into the ark. In this way it came to be revealed to Abraham, whose knowledge of it permitted him to gaze upon the glory of God. And from Abraham it was passed down to Isaac and to Jacob and to Joseph, who consulted it to discover the true meanings of dreams. The book was buried with Joseph, and in this way it was preserved when his coffin was raised by Moses from the Nile and carried beside the Tabernacle throughout the wandering of the Israelites in the wilderness. In this way the Book came into the possession of King Solomon, who made good use of its wisdom, and also sought its assistance in constructing the Temple. Some say that the book was lost again when the Temple was destroyed, its letters soaring on high as flames approached the Sanctuary in which it was hidden. Yet there are others who say that it was saved from the flames, and has been secretly passed down ever since. In this way it was said to have reached Rabbi Adam, and from Rabbi Adam it was passed down to the Ba'al Shem Tov, who learned the supernal mysteries from reading it and in this way became the Tzaddik of his generation. This is the most famous of all the chain midrashim, a linked set of myths. It tells the story of how God sent the angel Raziel to reveal this book to Adam, and how Adam came into possession of it. Subsequent myths describe how the book was passed down from Adam to Noah, following the genealogy in Genesis 5, and later reached the patriarchs and kings. The book that the angel Raziel left with Adam has two names: it is known as The Book of Raziel and as The Book of Adam. Raziel ha-Malakh explicitly records the transmission of the book from Adam to Enoch to Noah to Abraham, Isaac, Levi, Moses and Aaron, Pinhas, and so on down the generations. The myth of the Book of Raziel grows out of a midrash attempting to explain the verse. This is the book of the generations of Adam (Gen. 5:1). In B. Avodah Zarah 5a, Resh Lakish is quoted as saying: \"Did Adam have a book? This implies that God showed to Adam every generation that would ever exist, every generation with its sages and its leaders. When Adam reached the generation of Rabbi Akiba, he rejoiced at his teaching, but was grieved about his death.\" While most accounts of this heavenly book assume that the book had already been written and that Adam heard it for the first time when the angel Raziel read it to him, the Maharal proposes an alternate scenario in which Adam had all future events revealed to him in a vision, and later they were recorded in this book. That the angel leaves the book for Adam to read later indicates that books are so important in Jewish tradition that even the first man could read. The earliest mention of the angel Raziel is in the Book of Enoch. Raziel ha-Malakh, first published in Amsterdam in 1701, claimed to be the book that the angel Raziel gave to Adam. It largely consists of the names of God and of the angels, and the texts of amulets. The book itself was believed to have talismanic powers, especially the ability to ward off fires and other disasters. For this reason it was commonly found in many Jewish homes. .",

      "title": "Creating New Heavens And A New Earth",
      "content": "God constantly creates new heavens and a new earth from the new meanings that are discovered in the Torah. When the Torah was given to Moses, tens of thousands of angels on high were about to bum him with the flames of their mouths, but God protected him. Since then, whenever a new interpretation of the Torah is uttered, the saying rises up, is adorned with a crown, and then stands before God. And God guards that saying and keeps it hidden, and shelters the person who said it, to prevent the angels from envying him until a new heaven and a new earth are created from that saying. Thus every word that receives a new interpretation by one who delves into the study of the Torah creates a new heaven and a new earth, as it is said, \"That I may plant the heavens , and lay the foundations of the earth\" (Isa. 51:16).",
      "commentary": "This myth, based on Isaiah 66:22, demonstrates the primary role of interpreting the Torah, going as far as to assert that new interpretations are not only essential, but that God sees that they are crowned, protects them from the envy of the angels, and uses them as the basis for creating a new heaven and a new earth. What does \"a new heaven and a new earth\" mean? It means that the new interpretations that arise about the meanings of the Torah so radically change the perspective and understanding of those who receive them, that the heavens and earth seem new to them. This myth is thus an ode to the remarkable power of interpretation, and of the necessity for new interpretations to continue to be made, to prevent the views of the Torah from becoming static.

Otherwise I will return the world to chaos and void. For the world only exists for the sake of the Torah. Thus if the Torah would cease to be studied, the world would cease to exist'\" When the time came for the Giving of the Torah, God summoned all the people of the world and offered them the Torah, but none accepted it. The earth trembled on hearing this, for it feared it was on the point of returning to chaos. Israel was the last possibility, and the earth assumed that Israel, too, would turn down the Torah. But when Israel accepted the Torah, the earth became calm, as it is said. The earth was numbed with fright (Ps. 76:9).",
      "commentary": "Here God makes the existence of the world contingent on the acceptance and study of the Torah. This represents one tradition about the Giving of the Torah — that it was not an offer, but a demand. See \"God Offers the Torah to Israel,\" p. 264. It is said that God offered the Torah to Israel on the sixth of Sivan in the year 2448, in the 26th generation since the creation of the world (B. Pes. 118a). By implication, the fact that the world still exists confirms that there has never been a time devoid of faith in the Torah. In Likutei Moharan, Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav asserts that the world can only continue to exist if there are people in it who believe that it was created from nothing. For if there is no one alive who believes this, the world will cease to exist.",

When God spoke at Mount Sinai, this great light issued from the Word of the Lord and filled the whole earth. All the kings assembled and came to Balaam to ask if God was about to bring a second Flood upon the earth. Balaam said, \"He is now giving His Torah to the children of Israel. That Torah is the source of this great light that frightens you.\" There is an extensive tradition about light associated with creation, which grows out of Genesis 1:3 and the rabbinic myths associated with the primordial light. See \"The Light of the First Day,\" p. 83. Here the source of the light is described as being the Torah, and this idea is later developed in the Zohar, where it is said that a ray of h8rhf goes forth from the Torah whenever one who is studying it experiences the illumination of understanding. The primordial light was said to have been hidden away, and Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav suggested it was hidden in the Torah, which corresponds with this myth, since the light had its origin there in the first place. Rabbi Baruch of Kossov speaks of two kinds of light, a physical light and a spiritual light. When a person understands a verse of the Torah, he sees a light. This light stems from the essential light of the soul.",

She opened her lips in wisdom and praised God with all manner of song. When God said to her, \"Show me your appearance,\" she bowed her head and lifted her veil, and the splendor of her face filled all the palaces of heaven. When God said to her, \"Let me hear your voice,\" she lifted her voice in song. Then a heavenly voice went forth to say The teaching of Yahweh is perfect, renewing life (Ps. 19:8). Then God revealed the Throne of Glory to the Torah, and brought forth all the souls of the righteous, the souls of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the souls of Israel who would accept the Torah in the future, and He let them pass before her. After this God brought forth the soul of Moses from beneath his throne, and showed him to the Torah, and said to her, \"My daughter, rejoice and be happy, for this Moses is destined to become your bridegroom.

See \"God Consults the Angels About the Creation of Adam,\" p. 131. In both cases the angels are portrayed as jealous of God's affection for humans, and especially for Israel. The angels also resist Moses' ascent into heaven to receive the Torah, threatening to throw him from on high. Here, again, God comes to the rescue. See \"The Ascent of Moses,\" p. 261.",

She will adorn your head with a graceful wreath , crown you with a glorious diadem (Prov. 4:9). But it was not long before the children of Israel forsook the Torah, as it is said, \"They forsook My Torah and rejected it\" (Jer. 6:19). At that time God arranged the twenty-two letters of the Torah into acrostics of woe, to indicate the grievous events that would befall Israel. Just as the Torah is sometimes described as a ketubah , a wedding contract, between God and Israel, here the letters of the Torah are described as a necklace God gives to Israel as a precious gift. But when the people forsake the Torah, God arranges the letters into acrostics that prophesy grievous events. This myth thus portrays both God's generous and angry aspects. The acrostics referred to here are those found in the first four chapters of the Book of Lamentations. See \"The Marriage of God and Israel,\" p. 305.",

      "content": "Moses brought forth the people to meet God. Yahweh came down upon Mount Sinai , on the top of the mountain (Exod. 19:20). In that hour the world was completely silent. No one dared to breathe. No bird sang, no ox lowed, the sea did not roar, and no creature uttered a sound. Then God opened the portals of the seven firmaments and appeared over them eye to eye, in His beauty, in His glory, in the fullness of His stature, with His crown and upon His Throne of Glory. When He began to speak, thunder and lightning issued from God's mouth, and all of Israel flew back in horror at the sound of the awful voice. They ran without stopping for twelve miles, until their hearts gave out and their souls fled from them. All of them lay dead. Then the Torah turned to God, saying, \"Master of the Universe! Are You giving me to the living or to the dead?\" God replied, \"To the living.\" The Torah said, \"But they are all dead.\" And God said, \"For your sake I will revive them.\" So God let the dew of life fall from heaven, and as soon as it touched the people, they were restored to life, and they became strong and of good courage. That is why, at the resurrection of the dead in the End of Days, the Torah will stand up for the restoring of people's lives. Still, the people trembled mightily, even more than before. Nor were they brave enough to look up and gaze upon the Lord. They were not even strong enough to stand on their feet. God saw that their hearts would give out again, so He sent to earth one hundred and twenty myriads of ministering angels, so that there were two angels to every one of them, one to lay his hand on the heart of each one, to keep his heart still, and one to lift each one's head, so that he might behold the splendor of his Creator. In this way, awestruck but comforted by the angels, they each beheld the glory of God. Then God asked, \"Will you accept the Torah?\" And they all answered together, \"Yes!\" At that moment God opened up the seven heavens, as well as the seven earths, and all of Israel gazed from one end of the universe to the other. And God said, \"Behold that there is none like Me in heaven or on earth.\" And they saw with their own eyes that it was true. This haunting myth recounts that when God appeared on Mount Sinai, the shock of His voice caused all of the people to drop dead. God then revived them and gave each of the God,000 Jews assembled there two angels, one on his right hand and one on his left. The function of the angels was to calm the people enough for them to stand in the presence of God without having their souls flee from their bodies in terror. Each of the angels is said to have quoted a verse of the Torah. One angel said: \"It has been clearly demonstrated to you that Yahweh alone is God; there is none beside Him\" (Deut. 4:35). And the other angel said: \"Know therefore this day and keep in mind that the Lord alone is God in heaven above and on earth below; there is no other\" (Deut. 4:39). The myth of the two angels at Mount Sinai is found in Midrash Aseret ha-Dibrot ( Midrash of the Ten Commandments), where it is a commentary on the first commandment, I am the Lord your God (Ex. 20:2). Each of the stories in the collection is linked to one of the ten commandments. Midrash Aseret ha-Dibrot, dating from around the ninth century, is regarded as the first story anthology in Jewish literature.",

That is the meaning of the verse All the people saw the voices (Exod. 20:15). These voices were accompanied by sparks of fire and flashes of lightning like the letters of the commandments. They saw the fiery word issuing forth from the mouth of the Almighty and being engraved on the tablets, as it is said. The voice of the Lord engraves flames of fire (Ps. 29:4).

      "commentary": "This myth describes the intense revelatory experience of those present at Mount Sinai. It is sometimes described as a prophetic trance, sometimes as a blackout, sometimes as their spirits taking flight. See \"Death and Rebirth at Mount Sinai,\" p. 259. Note that this experience at Sinai includes a direct visual and aural perception of God— not only of God's voice (or seven voices), but an actual vision of God Himself. This makes it by far the greatest revelation in Jewish history. Midrash Tanhuma, Shemot 22 states that the voice of God split into 70 different voices. This echoes the tradition of the 70 faces of the Torah, meaning that there are 70 different ways of reading and understanding the Torah.",

      "content": "God did not reveal Himself on Mount Sinai like hailstones falling from heaven. Instead, He appeared slowly and gradually, moving from one mountaintop to the next until He descended upon Mount Sinai. But our forebears, standing at Mount Sinai to accept the Torah, saw no form resembling a human being, nor resembling the form of any creature, nor resembling the form of anything that has breath that God created on the face of the earth. They saw only God, the one God, whose kingdom endures in heaven and on earth, as it is said. For the Lord your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords (Deut. 10:17). This midrash presents Maimonides's interpretation of the verses, Yahweh came from Sinai and rose from Mount Seir to them; He shone forth from Mount Paran and He came from holy multitudes (Deut. 33:2). Likewise, Rashi agrees that God did not appear on Mount Sinai suddenly, but revealed Himself little by little. Eliyahu Rabbah offers the paradoxical view that those at Mount Sinai \"saw no form resembling a human being.\" At the same time, they saw God, who, according to this text, was not in a human image, despite Genesis 1:26, In the image of God He created them, and the extensive tradition linked to this verse. The theological purpose of insisting that the people saw no human form is to oppose the anthropomorphic tendencies in Judaism, and to reaffirm the tradition that God cannot be represented by an image. Yet both texts represented here do insist that the people saw something — they saw God, but what they saw cannot be described in human terms.",

      "title": "God Offers The Torah To Israel",
      "content": "Some say that from the time of Creation until Israel went out of Egypt, God went around offering the Torah to each and every nation, but they all refused to accept it. That is when God offered it to Israel. Others say that God created the world with a stipulation: \"If Israel accepts the Torah when it is offered to them, all of creation will continue to exist. Otherwise I will return the world to chaos and void.\" So when the children of Israel had gathered at Mount Sinai, And they took their places at the foot of the mountain (Exod. 19:17), God overturned the mountain like an inverted barrel, and held it above their heads and said: \"If you accept the Torah, all will be well. If not, you will be buried here.\" That is when Israel declared its willingness to accept the Torah. This midrash emphasizes the utterly essential role of Israel in God's plan of Creation. Here God declares at the beginning of the time of Creation that it is contingent on Israel s acceptance of the Torah. This leads to the grotesque image of God forcing Israel to accept the Torah by holding Mount Sinai over their heads. This account derives from a very literal interpretation of the verse And they took their places at the foot of the mountain (Exod. 19:17). In some versions, God first offers the Torah to every other nation, and each one turns it down. When He comes to Israel, the last nation to be asked, and holds the mountain oyer their heads, of course they say yes. What they actually say is \"We will do and we will listen (Exod. 24: 7). We will do\" refers to following God's commandments, the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. \"We will listen\" refers to studying the Torah with great intensity. This myth, then, personifies the \"yoke\" of the Law: it illustrates the compelling nature of Jewish law to those who observe it. According to B. Shabbat 88a, as a reward for saying \"We will do and we will listen,\" God,000 angels descended from heaven and tied two crowns, one for \"do\" and the other for \"listen,\" to the head of every Jew. Still, some commentaries attempt to reinterpret this midrash where the mountain held over the head of the people serves as a metaphor for the revelation of God's infinite love for them (Likutei Torah). At the same time, if God forced Israel to accept the Torah at Mount Sinai, it was indeed an agreement made under coercion, and it was not until the time of Mordecai and Esther that the Jewish people truly accepted the Torah of their own free choice: The Jews undertook and irrevocably obligated themselves and their descendants, and all who might join them, to observe these two days in the manner prescribed and at the proper time each year (Esther 9:27). The giant Og is also said to have uprooted a mountain and held it over the heads of the Israelites (B. Ber. 54b). See \"The Giant Og,\" p. 461. Hakham Yosef Hayim of Baghdad, known as Ben Ish Hai, links this midrash with the Oral Torah. In his view, the Israelites had already accepted the Written Torah when they said. We will do and we will listen (Exod. 24:7). But God had to coerce them to accept the Oral Law. That is why He held the mountain over their heads. Further, God hollowed out the mountain like a barrel to teach them that each letter of the Written Torah contains innumerable interpretations in the Oral Law, just as a barrel contains innumerable drops of wine. Thus God was demanding that their acceptance of the Written Law include their acceptance of the Oral Law. This is an interesting and original interpretation of this bizarre midrash about God offering the Torah to Israel.",

The explanation for this repetition is that God tore apart seven firmaments to demonstrate to Israel that there were no other gods. God is said to dwell above the seven firmaments.

God peered into the fiery letters of that Torah and created the world. At last the time came for the Torah to be given to Moses at Mount Sinai. From the top of the mountain, Moses peered into the heavens, and there he had a vision in which he saw the letters burning in black fire on white. The first letters to take form were those of God's Name, YHVH. Then the rest of the alphabet emerged. The letters danced, joining into hundreds of permutations of the names of God. Then the letters formed themselves into one long Name. This Name was none other than the letters of the Torah, for the entire Torah is a single, holy, mystical Name. There Moses read the Torah for the first time, and as he read each word, he heard the voice of God speaking it. Later Moses wrote everything down, exactly as he had heard it, and that is how the primordial Torah was transmitted to Israel. The primordial Torah is known as Torah Kedumah. This primordial Torah was one of the seven things created before the creation of the world. The image of the Torah being written in black fire on white, found in the Talmud and recurring in the Zohar , serves as an archetype for the primordial Torah. The notion of God looking into the Torah to create the world is found in Genesis Rabbah 1:1: \"Thus God consulted the Torah and created the world.\" Here God is portrayed as an architect and the Torah a blueprint in the creation of the world. See \"Seven Things Created before the Creation of the World,\" p. 74. The way the letters of the alphabet emerge and combine has an uncanny resemblance to the combining and recombining of strings of DNA.",

      "content": "The first stone tablets of the Law were created by God Himself on the eve of the first Sabbath. AH of the heavenly angels gathered together to see how the tablets were written with the finger of Cod (Exod. 31 :18) with black fire on white fire. As a result, the letters were visible through either side, for God had made them that way. The entire Torah was contained on those tablets. Some say that the first tablets were hewn from the foundation stone at the center of the world, while others say that they were made of sapphire taken from beneath the Throne of Glory. In origin, the first tablets were completely spiritual. How, then, was it possible for God to give them to Moses? Some say that at the instant the tablets were given to Moses by the hand of God, they assumed material form, and became stone tablets. Others say that they were made in the primordial light at the time of Creation, and descended from heaven in two stone tablets. Satan employed all his wiles to prevent Israel from receiving the first tablets from Moses. Had Israel received them, death would have disappeared forever, as would Satan's power over the people. To make them lose hope, Satan showed the people the bier of Moses suspended in the air, and they saw themselves as Moses' pallbearers. This led to the creation of the golden calf. The tablets that Moses went to heaven to receive had been written on the sixth day of Creation and had been waiting for him ever since. Before Moses, Enoch had ascended on high and had read everything written on the heavenly tablets, all the deeds of mankind to the remotest generations. When Moses descended from Mount Sinai and discovered the tribes of Israel worshipping the golden calf, he cast down the tablets of the Law and broke them at the foot of the mountain. This caused all the grief that Israel has experienced ever since, including the experience of death itself. For had the first tablets survived, every sorrow and calamity would have disappeared from the earth, and the world would have experienced freedom from the Angel of Death. It was God's intention for the Jewish people to attain freedom from death because of their acceptance of the Torah. But as a result of their idolatry, God decided that the people would remain mortal. So too would the second set of commandments differ from the first, for a set of laws designed for immortal people was no longer appropriate for them. How did the two sets of tablets differ? God inscribed the first set of tablets, Moses the second. No one knows what was written on the first tablets, but it is said that if the first tablets had not been broken, Jews would never have forgotten any Torah they had learned.",
      "commentary": "Some say that all the commandments on the first set were positive, while more than half of those of the second set are negative. For God saw that people could not be trusted to follow positive commandments, and therefore He put in the negative ones. Also, great secrets were revealed to Israel when the first tablets were given. But after the sin of the golden calf, Israel was no longer worthy of knowing those secrets. Therefore, they were forced to forget them. There are those who say that the first tablets were not engraved, but the letters fluttered on them in black fire superimposed on white fire. So that the instant Moses threw down the tablets, the letters took flight before the tablets broke against the ground. Others say that the letters took flight as Moses approached the border of the camp, where the golden calf was being worshipped, a place of defilement and transgression. Thus the letters took flight even before Moses cast down the tablets.",

Be ready by morning, and in the morning come up to Mount Sinai and present yourself there to Me, on the top of the mountain. No one else shall come up with you, and no one else shall be seen anywhere on the mountain; neither shall the flocks and the herds graze at the foot of this mountain. So Moses carved two tablets of stone, like the first, and early in the morning he went up on Mount Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him, taking the two stone tablets with him. The Lord came down in a cloud; He stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord. The Lord passed before him and proclaimed: \"The Lord! The Lord! A God compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in kindness and faithfulness, extending kindness to the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin; yet He does not remit all punishment, but visits the iniquity of parents upon children and children's children, upon the third and fourth generations.\" Moses hastened to bow low to the ground in homage, and said, \"If I have gained Your favor, O Lord, pray, let the Lord go in our midst, even though this is a stiff-necked people. Pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your own!\" God said: \"I hereby make a covenant. Before all your people I will work such wonders as have not been wrought on all the earth or in any nation; and all the people who are with you shall see how awe-inspiring are the Lord's deeds which I will perform for you.\" On descending Mount Sinai after receiving the Torah, Moses saw the people of Israel worshipping a golden calf and in his anger and disgust smashed the tablets on which the Torah was inscribed. Here God directs Moses to carve a second set of tablets. Since there were two sets, rabbinic texts wondered greatly whether the first revelation at Sinai was different from the second, and many myths hold that there were considerable differences between them.

Then everyone will know that I am the Lord of Israel and the Father of all the children of Jacob and King upon Mount Zion for all eternity.\" This striking myth from The Book of Jubilees runs contrary to the general belief that God dictated the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai, and that Moses wrote it down. Here God commands the angel of the Presence (who is referred to in later sources as Metatron) to write down the history of the world from the beginning to the End of Days. The reference to God's sanctuary being built for eternity may refer to the Temple in Jerusalem, which was to be rebuilt in the time of the Messiah. Or it could refer to the myth that the heavenly Temple will descend to earth in the messianic era. Since the Torah does not end with a vision of the coming of the Messiah, the myth in Jubilees makes another substantial change in the biblical narrative. Here Moses has all past and future history revealed to him much as does Adam when he reads The Book of Raziel, and his experience on Mount Sinai becomes more of a vision and less of a 40 days and nights dictation from God.",

For if the sections of the Torah had been given in the correct order, the precise reward and punishment for each commandment would be known. Further, anyone who read them would have unlimited powers. They would be able to wake the dead and perform miracles. That is why the true order and arrangement of the Torah was hidden and is known only to God. This rabbinic myth seems to foreshadow the concept of practical kabbalah, where knowledge of the mysteries was used to accomplish specific magical purposes, such as raising the dead or ascending on high. It is here that kabbalah and magic combine into one pursuit. The implication is that the order of the separate portions of the Torah itself was a powerful mystery, which is so secret that only God knows it. Here no other, angel or human, is said to share this secret, not even Moses, to whom the Torah was dictated by God. For if these sections were arranged in the true order, they would endow the possessor of this secret with unlimited, divine powers. Another parallel interpretation suggests that the words and letters of the Torah spell out the secret Name of God, which, if it were known, would convey divine power to whoever knew how to pronounce it.",

Then He said to Moses: Come up to the Lord (Exod. 24:1). Based on this midrash, it would appear that not all of God's decrees are immutable. This myth describes how at the beginning of time God and His heavenly retinue were entirely separated from the earthly realm by God's decree. But the Giving of the Torah was such a cosmic event that it overcame the separation between the heavenly and the earthly realms. Henceforth, God and the angels descended to earth, while earthly beings, such as Moses, were able to ascend to heaven. See \"The Ascent of Moses,\" p. 261.",

      "commentary": "Here God's giving of the Torah is described as an event that took place long before God intended it, as the need for the Torah was too great to wait a thousand generations, as God originally planned. The actual giving of the Torah is described almost as a presentation, in which God prepared himself by repeating it to Himself four times. These elements portray God as very humanlike, first changing his mind about when to give the Torah and then rehearsing the presentation as a human would. And during the actual giving of the Torah, God had a rapt audience, as the whole world remained silent and listened to God's voice. While the biblical account of the giving of the Torah makes it quite explicit that it was direct communication from God to Moses, The Book of Jubilees 1:27-28 has God direct the Angel of the Presence— who is elsewhere identified as Metatron— to serve as an intermediary, telling the angel to \"Write for Moses from the first of creation until My sanctuary is built in their midst.\"",

Here, however. Rabbi Jacob Emden (1697-1776) offers the possibility that God could provide a new revelation, different from the first at Sinai, and if so it would be the duty of the people of Israel to do God's bidding, no matter what it was. At the same time, Emden is making it clear that it would have to be a major revelation, as great as that at Sinai, in order to be recognized as replacing the old Torah.

      "title": "The Flying Letters",
      "content": "Before the world was created, the letters of the alphabet flew around without order, and nothing existed except chaos. To bring order out of chaos, God arranged the letters of the alphabet, beginning with aleph. Then God chose bet, the second letter, to begin the Torah and brought the Torah into being. After that, each of the letters took its place in the Torah. There are said to be God,000 letters, the same number as the Israelites assembled at Mount Sinai to receive the Torah. The Torah tells how the first tablets were engraved with God's finger. When Moses saw the golden calf. He hurled the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the mountain (Exod. 32:19). It is said of the letters inscribed on those tablets that they took flight and ascended on high. Ever since, the letters of the Torah have taken flight in times of danger. The Talmud tells of Rabbi Haninah ben Teradion, who was wrapped in the scroll of the Torah and set on fire, for daring to study the Torah in public in Rome, when it was forbidden. His disciples called out, \"Rabbi what do you see?\" Rabbi Haninah answered, \"The parchment is burning, but the letters are soaring on high.\" The Zohar tells that not long after the death of Shimon bar Yohai, Rabbi Judah fell asleep beneath a tree, and in a dream he saw Rabbi Shimon ascending on high, bearing a scroll of the Torah in his arms. Behind him flew a flock in formation. Then Rabbi Judah looked closer and saw that it was not a flock of birds but a flock of flying letters that followed Rabbi Shimon. At first. Rabbi Judah was mystified. Then he suddenly understood that what he was seeing was a book of flying letters that Rabbi Shimon was taking up with him. And in the dream. Rabbi Judah watched them ascend until they disappeared. When Rabbi Judah awoke and remembered this dream, he knew that when Rabbi Shimon had died, the world had lost the precious store of his wisdom. For now that book of celestial mysteries had returned to its place on high. The motif of flying letters is found in many variations in Jewish lore. The earliest examples of this theme are found in rabbinic lore concerning the Tablets of the Law shattered by Moses in Exodus 32:19. The myth explains that before the tablets struck the ground, the letters ascended on high (Avot de-Rabbi Natan 2:11). The other famous tale about flying letters concerns the execution of Haninah ben Teradion, who was wrapped in the scroll of the Torah. When asked what he saw as the flames burned, he replied: \"The parchments are being burnt but the letters are soaring on high\" (B. A. Z. 18a). The Zohar recounts a tale about a book of flying letters. It emphasizes how much the world lost at the time of the death of Shimon bar Yohai. Here Rabbi Judah has a dream in which he sees Bar Yohai ascending on high, followed by a flock of flying letters. These are the letters of the book of his wisdom, which has been lost due to his death. Rabbinic lore often recounts remarkable events that are said to have taken place when important rabbis have died.",

Then bring new tablets and I will append My signature to them.\" God's signature, in the context of this midrash, refers to the rewriting of the second tablets. According to tradition, the first tablets of the Law were written by the finger of God, but the second were written by Moses. In this myth, God offers to add His signature to the second tablets, to make them official, as with the signing of a contract. Psalms 119:60 states that \"The beginning of Your word is Truth,\" and according to B. Shabbat 55a, Truth is the signature of God.\" Drawing on this interpretation. Rabbi Yosef Hayim of Baghdad (1834-1909), known as Ben Ish Hai, states in Ben Yehoyada that God's signature is actually imprinted in the Torah, since the last letters of the first three words of the Torah spell emet, \"truth.\"",

When God asked them if they were ready to receive the Torah, they replied, \"We will do and we will listen \" (Exod. 24:7). And when they gave preference to \"we will do\" over \"we will listen ,\" a heavenly voice went forth and said: \"Who has revealed this secret to my children, which is known by the angels, to do and then to listen?\" Just then six hundred thousand ministering angels came down from on high and set two crowns upon each Israelite, one as a reward for \"we will do\" and one for \"we will listen.\" But as soon as Israel sinned through the golden calf, twice as many destroying angels descended and snatched those crowns away. It is deduced that the angels know the secret of first doing and then listening because of the verse. Bless the Lord, O His angels, mighty creatures who do His bidding , ever hearkening to His bidding; bless the Lord, all His hosts, His servants who do His will (Ps. 103:20). Here, they first fulfill, then hearken. In Likutei Moharan 1:22 Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav interprets \"do\" to refer to the Revealed Torah (or Written Torah) and \"listen\" to refer to the Hidden Torah (or Oral Torah).",

      "content": "After the return to Zion, the people set about rebuilding the Temple in Jerusalem. But they soon discovered that because of the effort required to rebuild the Temple, they no longer had time to study Torah, as God required of them. For God said, \"You are to occupy yourselves with My Chosen House, and discussion of the Torah is never to leave your lips.\" Yet it seemed impossible to do both at the same time. When the builders complained to God about this, God first chastised them for not having studied more when they were in exile, depriving Him of hearing words of Torah from their lips. But then God informed the angels that He intended to reveal the secret of the Sar ha-Torah to the builders. With this secret, it was possible to acquire knowledge of the Torah and its secrets in a short time, without fear of forgetting them. When the angels heard this, they pleaded with God not to reveal this secret. \"Do not make flesh and blood equal to us. Let them labor in the Torah as they have for generations. If You reveal this secret to Your children, the small will be like the great, the fool like the wise man.\" But God dismissed the opinion of the angels and God Himself descended into the Temple as it was being built. When the builders saw the Throne of Glory hovering above the altar, with the King of the World on it, they fell upon their faces. Then God said, \"My children, why are you prostrating yourselves? Rise and sit before My throne the way you sit in an academy, and learn the secret of how to lift up the paths of your mind to gaze into the Torah.\" Thus did God reveal to the builders the secret of how to call upon the Sar ha-Torah, the Prince of the Torah. This secret was first revealed to Moses, who used it to receive the Torah at Mount Sinai. Knowledge of this secret makes it possible to bring the Prince of the Torah down from on high by magical means, by the use of holy names, in order to reveal how to acquire vast knowledge of the Torah. After that the builders were able to busy themselves with building the Temple, and nonetheless the Torah did not depart from their lips. Rabbi Ishmael said of these builders: \"Our fathers refused to set one stone on another in the Lord's temple until they convinced the King of the World and his servants to reveal to them the secret of the Torah.\" Sar ha-Torah is the Prince of the Torah, who is the Angel of the Torah. The angel's name is Yefefiah. The tradition concerning this angel states that when invoked, the angel reveals the secret of how to leam the Torah in one sitting. There is a series of accounts about those who invoked the Sar ha-Torah. But the primary myth concerns the inability of the builders of the Second Temple in Jerusalem to find time to study Torah. Here God Himself descends into the newly built Temple and reveals the secret of the Sar ha-Torah . The builders invoke the angel, rapidly leam the Torah, and this provides a reward both for God, Who revels in their study, and for themselves. In the text of Sar ha-Torah , God makes an assertion about those desiring ever more extensive teachings of the Torah: \"I know what you want. You desire a great deal of Torah and much Talmud and many oral traditions. You crave My many secrets.\" Normally, it takes a lifetime of study to master the extensive traditions linked to the Torah, but through the miracle of the secret of the Prince of the Torah, it becomes possible to master this intricate study in a single sitting. This must have been a common fantasy among the students of the Torah.",

When Rabbi Eleazar ben Arakh studied the Torah, fire descended from heaven and surrounded him. Angels danced as at a wedding party, and trees burst into song. Once, when Ben Azzai was studying Torah, there was a flame surrounding him. They asked: \"Are you perhaps engaged in the study of the Mysteries of the Chariot?\" He replied: \"No, I am but finding in the Torah parallels to the Prophets, and in the Prophets parallels to the Aggadah. And the words of the Torah are joyful even as they were on the day they were given at Sinai, and they were originally given in fire, as it is said. The mountain was ablaze with flames\" (Deut. 4:11).",

And when God enters the Garden to delight in the righteous, those words are brought before Him, and He gazes at them and rejoices. While the subject that Rabbi Yonathan ben Uziel was studying is not given, both Rabbi Eleazar ben Arakh and Ben Azzai are linked to study of Ma'aseh Merkavah, the Mysteries of the Chariot.

      "content": "There are two Torahs: the Written Torah and the Oral Torah. It is said that God dictated the Torah to Moses during the day, and at night He explained it to him. These explanations constitute the Oral Torah. Moses wanted to write down the whole Torah, but God told him that only certain parts could be written down, while other parts had to remain oral. All of the Torah had to be revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai so that no one could claim that only a part of the Torah had been given at the outset. But due to the immensity of all that Moses had to remember, at first he had less than total recall. However, as his body became more and more subordinate t6 his soul over the forty days and nights, Moses became capable of absorbing all of the Oral Torah without forgetting any part of it. Midrash Tehillim explains that Moses knew it was day when God instructed him in the Written Law, and he knew it was night when God instructed him in the Oral Law. Rabban Gamliel was asked: \"How many Torahs were given to Israel?\" He answered, \"Two, one orally and one in writing.\" In Avot de-Rabbi Natan 15, a tale is recounted of a man who came separately to Shammai and Hillel and asked how many Torahs there were. Each of them replied, \"Two, one written and one oral.\" The man said he was prepared to accept the written Torah but not the oral one. Shammai rebuked the man. Hillel sat him down and explained that even as he had accepted that the aleph of the alphabet was aleph and that the bet was bet , so he had to accept both the written and oral Torahs in good faith. In Likutei Moharan, Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav explains that in each generation there are new revelations of the Torah. Some of these should be written down, while others should only be taught orally. To this day, there are teachers of the Torah who limit some of their esoteric teachings to oral explanations that are not supposed to be written down. Jacob Neusner uses the term \"Dual Torah\" instead of \"the two Torahs,\" and this usage has become widely accepted.",

Then, it is said, a maidservant saw at the sea things that were not seen by the prophet Ezekiel. It is also said that the whole world existed for the day on which the Song of Songs was given. Others say that the Song of Songs was given on Mount Sinai, together with the Torah, and that God Himself, not King Solomon, is the true author, and it was God who gave it to His people. Defending the inclusion of the Song of Songs in the Bible, Rabbi Akiba said, \"All the books of the Bible are holy, but the Song of Songs is the Holy of Holies.\" Here the Song of Songs is described as being revealed in a revelationatlKe Red Sea that is parallel to that at Mount Sinai. In each case heaven opened and its secrets in the form of the Torah or, as here, the Song of Songs, were revealed. Note that the parting of the Red Sea is the second most important revelation in Jewish history, the first being the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. This directly implies that the Song of Songs is the holiest book of the Bible after the Torah. The alternate version presents the Song of Songs as even holier, in that it is said to have been given along with the Torah at Mount Sinai, and disputes the tradition that King Solomon was its author by stating that the true author was none other than God Himself. Both versions of this myth emphasize the unimaginable holiness of the Song of Songs and counter any resistance to it as merely a collection of erotic love poems.",

      "title": "The Origin Of The Shema",
      "content": "When the hour drew near for Jacob to take leave of this world, he called his sons together and said to them, \"Do you have any doubts that God spoke and the world came into being?\" They replied, \"Hear, O Israel, our father. Just as you have no doubts that God spoke and the world came into being, so too do we have no doubts. Surely, The Lord , our God, the Lord is one \" (Deut. 6:4). That is why it is still said, to this day, \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.\" And that is how the prayer of the Shema was created. This legendary explanation for the origin of the Shema builds on the fact that \"Israel\" refers both to Jacob, who became Israel, and to the people Israel. Usually \"Hear, O Israel\" is understood to refer to the people Israel, but since Jacob's name was changed to Israel, the opening phrase of the Shema, \"Hear, O Israel\" can be understood to be directed to the patriarch Jacob/Israel as well as to the people Israel. Since his sons add \"our father,\" there can be no question that they are directing their words to Jacob. This same kind of double reference for \"Israel\" is found in Genesis 49:2: Assemble yourselves, and hear, you sons of Jacob, and hearken to Israel , your father. In the version of the origin of the Shema found in Deuteronomy Rabbah, Jacob's concern is that his sons not be idol worshippers. So he called all his sons to his bed and said, \"Hear your father, Israel, and worship God, whom your father worships.\" They answered, \"Hear, O Israel, our father, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.\" Both versions draw on the double meaning of Israel both as Jacob and as the people of Israel. . The first verse of the Shema, from J Peuteronomy fr4 . reads: Shema Yisrael, Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai Ehad, \"Hear,!? IsraeCthe Lord our God, the Lord is One.\" The Shema is the primary proclamation of belief in Judaism, an ^esse ntial part of the daily prayer service. According to the Shulhan Arukh, the Code of Jewish Law, the first verse of the Shema is recited in a loud voice. It is the practice of Yemenite Jews to read the Shema out loud, in unison. This is based on the belief that God harkens to the Shema when it is read in unison. This tradition is based on Song of Songs Rabbah 8:13: \"When Israel reads the Shema with proper kavanah (intention), in one voice, God and all the heavenly hosts hearken to their voice. But when the reading of the Shema is fragmented, God tells them to learn from the angels, who praise God in one voice and one melody.\" Also, it is customary to cover one's eyes when reciting the first verse of the Shema (Shulhan Arukh, Keriat Shema, 61:5). This custom can be traced to the talmudic sage. Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi, who covered his face with his hand when he accepted the Yoke of Heaven (B. Ber. 13b).",

This is one of the earliest mythic versions of an attempt to create a human being, a golem. While lacking in detail, this talmudic tale implies that Rava has somehow used magical powers to create a man. Rabbi Zera, on the other hand, does not believe that such a creation is permitted, and he commands the golem to return to the dust. From this account we learn that the golem was defective in that it could not communicate, which leads Rabbi Zera to conclude that the man is not real. Other versions of the golem myth mention that it cannot reproduce. In the same section of tractate Sanhedrin there is an account of a three-year old calf created by Rav Haninah and Rav Oshaya.

Together they submerged themselves in the Sefer Yetzirah for three years. At the end of three years, they set about combining the letters of the alphabet, and in this way they created a man on whose head was written YHVH Elohim emet — \"The Lord God is Truth,\" and there was a knife in his hand. All at once the being they had created erased the first letter of emet — truth, leaving only met — dead. Distraught, Jeremiah asked the man why he had done this. The man answered: \"God created you in His image, but now that you have created a man, people will say, 'These two are the only gods in the world/\" Jeremiah asked, \"What can we do?\" The man answered: \"Pronounce the letters backward with which you created me.\" So they did, and the being turned to ashes and dust. There are a series of myths about the creation of the golem, a man made out of clay and brought to life drawing on the power of the Hebrew alphabet. Here the prophet Jeremiah is said to have created such a golem drawing on the mystical secrets found in the Sefer Yetzirah, the Book of Creation, one of the earliest (some would say the earliest) kabbalistic texts. Here the being that Jeremiah and his son bring to life uncreates itself by erasing the first letter of emet— Truth 7 — inscribed on its forehead, leaving met — \"dead,\" as the creature itself feels that its creation is wrong, since it attempts to duplicate God's power in creating human beings. In most golem myths, the creature dies as soon as the aleph that is the first letter of emet is erased. Here, however, the golem tells them to pronounce the letters backward to undo the creation. This should be seen as an interim stage in the development of the golem myth, which culminates in the fully developed myth of the Golem of Prague.",

      "content": "It is said about Rabbi Solomon ibn Gabirol that he drew upon the mysteries to create a woman who served him. When he was denounced to the authorities, he showed them that she was not a full or complete creature. And he restored her to the pieces of wood of which she had been constructed. The Hebrew poet Solomon ibn Gabirol (1021-1056) was also said to be versed in kabbalistic mysteries. In this account he creates a female golem for the purpose of serving him. There is some ambiguity about whether she was created for sexual purposes. Had he created her for some greater good, such as the protection of the community, this might have been seen as acceptable. But that was not the case. When confronted by the authorities, he demonstrated that the woman was not fully human, rather, she is a female golem. On the one hand the story seems to extol the powers of Ibn Gabirol, but on the other hand he is portrayed as self-serving. Also, there is a hint of the salacious about his intentions in creating such a golem. But, above all, it is evidence that the golem motif, which first appears in the Talmud in the creation of a calf that was eaten on the Sabbath, was still alive. This eleventh-century myth about creating a golem is transformed into the cycle of stories about the Golem of Prague. In the latter, however, the creation of the golem is compelled by the dire situation in which the Jews were found, suffering from regular pogroms through the Middle Ages. Since there was no solution in reality, a fantasy solution evolved, that of the golem created by Rabbi Judah Loew to protect the Jews of Prague from the blood libel accusation, in which Jews were falsely accused of using the blood of a Christian (usually a child) to make matzah for the Passover Seder, a libel that led to centuries of pogroms against the Jews throughout Europe. Yet even though the purposes in creating these two golems, one female and one male, are quite different, the knowledge and powers attributed to both figures underlie both tales. How was the golem of Ibn Gabirol created? The story lacks details, but the method was surely by some means of holy letters and names. In the Yudel Rosenberg versions of the golem cycle, which are probably much later than they were claimed to be — nineteenth century instead of the sixteenth— Rabbi Loew went through a magical ritual, inscribing the word emet — truth — on the forehead of the golem, and putting a paper with God's Name on it in the golem's mouth, walking around it seven times, till it glowed. Only then did it come to life. Later, after the golem had served its purpose.",

      "title": "The Golem Of Rabbi Elijah",
      "content": "Rabbi Elijah of Chelm was a Master of the Name. It was he alone, in his generation, who knew the secret pronunciation of God's Name. This gave him the power to accomplish anything. So too was he well versed in the Sefer Yetzirah, The Book of Creation. Drawing on mysteries revealed there, he made a man of clay, inscribed the word emet — truth — on its forehead, and when he uttered God's Name, the golem came to life. Thereafter, the golem performed wonders whenever there was urgent need for them. Then it happened that the golem began to grow larger and larger, and Rabbi Elijah was afraid it might destroy the world. So he ordered the golem to bend down and he removed the first letter of the word on its forehead, changing emet into met — dead — and at that instant the golem turned back into dust. There are several versions of this famous story about the golem of Rabbi Elijah of Chelm (sixteenth century). In some versions, the golem is said to have scratched the rabbi's face while he removed the name from its forehead, or, in other versions, even to have crushed him. Likewise, in some Christian versions Rabbi Elijah is said to have used the golem to perform hard work for him, suggesting that his motives in creating the golem were not altruistic. While most accounts of the golem place the word \" emet \" on his forehead, some describe the word \"emet\" hung on a chain around his neck. Here is the version of the golem story found in Journal for Hermits by Jakob Grimm (1808), which became widely disseminated: After saying certain prayers and observing certain fast days, the Polish Jews make the figure of a man carved from clay or mud. When they pronounce the miraculous name of God over him, he must come to life. He cannot speak, but he understands fairly well what is commanded. They call him golem and use him as a servant to do all sorts of housework. But he must never leave the house. On his forehead is written emet— truth. Every day he gains weight and becomes somewhat larger and stronger than all the others in the house, regardless of how little he was to begin with. For fear of him, they therefore erase the first letter, so that nothing remains but met — death, whereupon he collapses and turns to clay again. But one man's golem once grew so tall, and he heedlessly let him keep on growing so long that he could no longer reach his forehead. In terror he ordered the servant to take off his boots, thinking that when he bent down he could reach his forehead. So it happened, and the first letter was successfully erased, but the whole heap of clay fell on the Jew and crushed him. It would appear that Jakob Grimm drew upon the account of Rabbi Elijah's golem, although there are some interesting variations. Grimm's version suggests that the golem was used as a servant, and that the motives of his creator were not altruistic. In the Grimm version, as soon as the holy name is removed from the golem's forehead, it collapses on top of its creator and kills him. No such catastrophe occurs in the account of Rabbi Elijah's golem.",

      "content": "Again and again the Jewish community of Prague was accused of the blood libel. Rabbi Judah Loew, known as the Maharal, prayed that he might be told in a dream how to fight against the accusation. In his dream, he received a reply from heaven in ten words, telling him to create a golem out of clay, who would protect the Jews against those who wanted to destroy them. The Maharal was convinced that the secret of how to bring such a creature to life could be found in those ten words. And at last he found it. The Maharal called his son-in-law and his oldest pupil, and disclosed the secret to them about how the golem could be created. They served as his assistants, each of them representing one of the elements of fire, water, and air, who together could complete the creation of the golem out of earth, the fourth element. He made them vow not to reveal the secret to anyone. Then on the twentieth of Adar in the year 5340 (1580), the three of them left Prague at four o'clock in the morning and went to the river Moldau. Out of the clay they dug from the bank of the river, they made a human form, which lay there like a man on his back. Each of them walked around it seven times, reciting a spell that the Maharal had taught them, until the golem began to glow, and his body became covered with hair, and nails appeared at the tips of his fingers and toes. And when they pronounced the verse And God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living creature (Gen. 2:7), the golem opened his eyes and looked at them with wonder. The Maharal called out for him to stand up, and the golem rose at once to his feet. Then they dressed him in clothes that they had brought with them, and put shoes on his feet, so that he looked exactly like a man. He saw, heard, and understood everything, but he lacked the power of speech. Before dawn all four of them returned home. On the way home, the Maharal told the golem that his name was Joseph, and explained why he had been created. So too did he tell him that he must obey all of his commands, no matter what, and the golem nodded to show that he agreed. After that the Maharal told the members of his household that he had met this poor man, who was unable to speak, in the street, and he had taken him into the house out of pity, to be of service to him. And that is how the golem was created and brought into being. Perhaps no Jewish legend has captured the popular imagination as has that of the golem, the creature made out of clay by Rabbi Judah Loew of Prague (known as the Maharal) and brought to life by the use of Various magical incantations, including holy names. This creature, according to the legend, protected the Jews of Prague from various dangers, especially that of the blood libel accusation— that is, the use of the blood of Christian children to bake unleavened bread for Passover. This lie had consistently disastrous consequences, leading to many pogroms against the Jews. Here the golem discovers the body of a murdered Christian child who has been carried into the Jewish ghetto, and carries it back through tunnels into the basement of the actual murderer, the sorcerer Thaddeus, thus staving off a pogrom. Knowledge of this myth cycle is primarily derived from Niflaot Maharal, a collection of tales about Rabbi Loew and the golem, published in 1909 by Rabbi Yudel Rosenberg, who claimed that they had been compiled in the sixteenth century by a relative of Rabbi Loew. Recent scholars, including Dov Sadan, Gershom Scholem, and Eli Yassif, have insisted that Rabbi Rosenberg himself was the author of the book, which he",

So he called his son-in-law and his oldest pupil, who had taken part in the creation of the golem, and at two in the morning they went up to the loft in the Alt-Neu synagogue, where the golem was sleeping. The three of them placed themselves at the head of the golem, and began to circle around him from left to right. There were seven circuits, and after each one they stopped and pronounced the spell that the Maharal had taught them, drawn from the Book of Creation. It was the same spell they had used to create the golem, only they recited it in the opposite order. After the seventh circuit the golem was reduced to a mass of clay in the shape of a human being. They wrapped it in two old prayer shawls, and hid the mass among the fragments of books in the loft, so that nothing of it could be seen. The next day it was reported that the golem had rim away. Very few people knew what had really taken place. After that the Maharal ordered that no one was to enter the loft of the synagogue. People thought it was a precaution against fire, but confidants of the Maharal knew that it was because the remains of the golem were lying there.",

There was a deep fear of that place. But once some children went up to the attic to see if the remains of the golem were still there. After they went up, they were unable to come down. After reciting psalms and prayers, the Jews of Prague climbed up the big ladder that led to the attic. There they found that the children were lying on the floor of the attic, in a deep sleep, nor could they wake them until they carried them out of that place.

      "content": "Among the enemies of Maimonides it is told that he created a monster, a homunculus. How did it happen? Maimonides had an assistant, a young man, to whom he taught many of the secrets of creation. In time the two became inseparable. Their researches were pursued largely in common, and when one of them was at a loss, the other came to his assistance. Thus together they studied almost all branches of knowledge. In time the student almost surpassed his master in learning, and they decided to follow a path together that past generations had never pursued. They wanted to observe the secrets of creation and destruction in nature and then solve the great riddle of creation. Maimonides showed his assistant a passage in the Book of Creation, where it said, \"Kill a healthy man, cut his body into pieces, and place the pieces in an airless glass container. Sprinkle upon them an essence gathered from the sap of the Tree of Life and the balsam of immortality, and after nine months the pieces of this body will be living again. It will be unharmable and immortal.\" But who were they to get for this dangerous experiment? They decided it would have to be one of them. So they cast lots to decide. But first they swore, in God's Name, that whoever lived would permit the dead to ripen, and would not, for whatever reason, destroy the apparatus prematurely, in orderto destroy the embryonic life. Both men laid their hands on the Torah and swore. The lot was cast and fell to the pupil. Maimonides conjured up the Angel of Death, and the young man fell lifeless to the ground. Maimonides cut the body into pieces, placed it in a glass container, sprinkled it with the wondrous essence, and left the room, which he carefully locked and did not enter for four months. Finally, tortured by doubt and curiosity, he looked at the mass of dead flesh. And behold, there were no longer severed pieces but structured limbs, as if crystallized in the glass container. Happy about the restoration of his student, he left the room and waited a month. In the fifth month the form of the human body could already be recognized. In the sixth the arteries and nerves were visible, and in the seventh movement and life in the organs could be perceived. The researcher, however, became worried. Maimonides was now convinced of the veracity of The Book of Creation. And he was terrified about the future.",

      "content": "All things are judged on Rosh ha-Shanah, and their fate is sealed on Yom Kippur. Some say there is a ledger in heaven that records all that has taken place from the time of Adam throughout the generations. The ledger is open, and the hand is writing every single thing that a person does below. Whose hand is this? Some say it is that of an angel. Others say that the hand belongs to God Himself, and that the book is the book that God is writing. That is the meaning of the verse And a scroll of remembrance has been written at His behest (Mai. 3:16). This is the Book of Life. In addition to the Book of Life, there is a second book, the Book of Deat h. During the Days of Awe God's scrutiny of our fives is intense, and it is to be hoped that if our name has strayed to the wrong ledger, God will say, \"I have removed your name from the Book of Death and put it in the Book of Life, as it is said. For Yahweh has redeemed Jacob \" (Isa. 44:23). Others say that there are three books opened in heaven on Rosh ha-Shanah, the New Year: one for the wholly righteous, one for the wholly wicked, and one for those who are neither completely righteous nor completely wicked. The wholly righteous are inscribed at once and sealed in the Book of Life; the wholly wicked are inscribed at once and sealed in the Book of Death; and the fate of the intermediate is suspended from Rosh ha-Shanah until Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. If they repent and are found worthy, they are inscribed for life; if they fail to repent, they are inscribed for death. Yet so great is the power of atonement on Yom Kippur, that it is said to bring about atonement even for those who have not repented. When God sits on the Throne of Judgment, the Books of Life and Death are open before Him, as it is said, The court sat and the books were opened (Dan. 7 :10). His garment is as white as snow, the harTorTHis head pure wool, and His cloak seventy times brighter than the sun. A pair of angels, both named Sh ofariel,j*re the keepers of the Bo oks, which are closed to everyone else. No other angels have access to the secrets inscribed there. Not even Metatron, the Prince of the Presence, is permitted to peer at that divine list. Among the sages, only the Ari knew how to peer into those secret books. In this way he learned the fate of his followers from the first of Rosh ha-Shanah.",
      "commentary": "Some say that the world is not only judged on those holy days, but that God sits upon the Throne of Judgment and judges the world every day. The Books of the Living and the Books of the Dead are opened before him, and all the children of heaven stand before him in fear, dread, awe, and trembling. And in this world as well every being trembles before the eyes of God. Others say that God is a merciful God. Even as clouds are swept away by wind, so the iniquities of Israel are swept away in this world, as it is said, I wipe away your sins like a cloud (Isa. 44:22). For from the time He created Adam, God has known that if He held mankind to account for its successive misdeeds, the world would not endure. Therefore God remembers those who observe the Torah, but puts those who commit misdeeds out of mind. This means that God removes their names from the Book of Death and puts them in the Book of Life. There is a series of myths about heavenly books. Some of these are described as ledgers in which God keeps track of good and bad behavior. The best known of these myths concern the Books of Life and Death. The talmudic version lists three books all linked to Rosh ha-Shanah: the Book of Life, the Book of Death, and a book concerning the fate of the intermediate. However, for most Jews there is a conscious focusing on the Book of Life, while the Book of Death remains for the most part unnamed and largely unmentioned, and the notion of a third book has essentially vanished from the tradition. The current understanding is that a person's name is inscribed on Rosh ha-Shanah either in the Book of Life or the \"Other Book,\" (i.e.. The Book of Death), but the name is not sealed until Yom Kippur. This is stated succinctly in the Talmud: \"Man is judged on Rosh ha-Shanah and his fate is sealed on Yom Kippur\" (B. RH 16a). Altogether, these ten days are known as the ten Days of Awe, and they serve as an intensive period of selfexamination and repentance, climaxing on the day of Yom Kippur. There is also an element of negotiating with God, as Abraham did concerning the fate of Sodom. The hope, of course, is to obtain God's forgiveness in order to change a negative fate. According to the Talmud ( B . RH 17b), \"Great is the power of repentance; it can rescind a person's final sentence.\" There is a biblical precedent for these heavenly books, found m jpr pjni^h 17-1Tf ip guilt of Judah is inscribed with a stylus of iron, engraved with an adamant point. Another reference is found in Malachi 3:16, And a scroll of remembrance has been written at His behest. In Esther Rabbah 2:23, this is referred to as the Book of God. It is important to note that these heavenly books are not to be confused with the Torah. The general view is that they are for God's eyes alone. These other books were never handed down from heaven, as was the Torah. The one possible exception is The Book ofRaziel , said to have been given to Adam by the angel Raziel. However, The Book ofRaziel can be seen as a substitute for the Torah, until it was given at Mount Sinai. See \"The Book of Raziel,\" p. 253. Another heavenly book is described by Ezekiel, who has a vision of the semblance of the Presence of the Lord (Ezek. 1:28), and hears a mysterious figure speaking, who tells him to \" open your mouth and eat what I am giving you \" (Ezek. 2:8): As I looked , there was a hand stretched out to me, holding a written scroll. He unrolled it before me, and it was inso bbed on both the front and the ba ck (Ezek. 2:9-10). Since scrolls are traditionally written on only one side, Ezekiel seems to be describing a new kind of book, one relevant to the inner, spiritual life, as well as to day to day existence in the world. Zechariah has a vision of a flying scroll, presumably of heavenly origin: \"What do you see? \" he asked. And I replied, \"A flying scroll, twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide\" (Zech. 5:1). The description of God seated on His Throne of Judgment derives from Daniel 7:9. 1 Enoch 47:3 has a vivid description of God seated on the Throne of Glory, with the Books of Life and Death open before him, and all of God's counselors standing there. 3 Enoch describes a pair of angels, whose full names are Shofariel YHVH Memit and Shofariel YHVH Mehayeh. They are the keepers of the Books, which are closed to",

      "content": "Adam repented of his sin by standing in the River Gihon for one hundred and thirty years, until his skin began to shrivel. When God saw that Adam had truly repented. He absolved him, giving him the Torah as a substitute for the Garden of Eden that he had lost. That eventful day was in the first month of Tishrei. Therefore God spoke to Adam: \"You shall be the prototype of my children. As you have been judged by Me on this day and absolved, so your children, Israel, shall be judged by me on this New Year's day, and they shall be absolved.\" The usual explanation is that Rosh ha-Shanah is the birthday of the world. Here God's absolution of Adam is linked to the origin of Rosh ha-Shanah. Not only does",
      "commentary": "this myth provide such an origin, making Rosh ha-Shanah commemorate the day that God forgave Adam for the sin of eating the forbidden fruit, but it also states that God gave the Torah to Adam as a replacement for having lost the Garden of Eden.",

Implicit in this interpretation is the suggestion that God, who renews the world, might decide not to renew it.

Likewise, every Rosh ha-Shanah the existence of the world is renewed. That is because on Rosh ha-Shanah, the birthday of the world, God judges all His creations. It is decided in heaven whether everything in creation is fulfilling the secret purpose of creation, which is known to God alone. For if God determined that creation was acting against God's intent, there would be no future need of it, and all of existence would come to an end. This important myth emphasizes the world's fragility, and that its continuity is not guaranteed, but that it is renewed every Sabbath and every Rosh ha-Shanah. This changes the meaning of Rosh ha-Shanah, which serves as the day of Judgment not only for people, but for the world as well.

No one is left out of this judgment; even the angels are judged on that day, for it is the Day of Judgment. God made this Day of Judgment to ensure that all abide by the Law. So too did God create the prosecuting angel who comes before Him and demands that all people in the world be judged. So it is that on Rosh ha-Shanah the judgment is written and on Yom Kippur it is signed and sealed. Rosh ha-Shanah is both the Day of Judgment and the New Year. As the Day of Judgment, it is a solemn occasion on which God makes a judgment about whether we will live or die in the coming year and writes it down. However, it is not signed and sealed until Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. Yet Rosh ha-Shanah is also the New Year, and as such it is a day of celebration. Both of these contradictory qualities — the solemn and the celebratory — characterize Rosh ha-Shanah, which is also a day of remembrance, a day of sounding the shofar, and a holy convocation.",

Before he enters the Holy of Holies, they all pronounce benedictions before him and pray for his welfare. Then a golden cord is attached to his foot, so that if he should die in the Holy of Holies they can drag him out without entering it themselves. He takes three steps, then another three, then another three, and they all remain where they are and do not follow him. He enters the Holy of Holies and hears the sound of the wings of the cherubim, who sing and beat their wings. Then he bums incense, and the sound of their wings subsides, and there is perfect silence. At that moment a ray of light goes forth, along with the scent of pure balsam, and it pervades the Holy of Holies. Then everything is still, and there is no room for the Accuser. Then the priest opens his mouth in prayer, and prays with devotion and joy. And when he is finished, the cherubim lift up their wings and begin to sing again. Then the High Priest knows that his prayer has been accepted, and that there is joy above and below. The Holy of Holies of the Temple in Jerusalem was only permitted to be entered one day a year, on Yom Kippur, and then only by the High Priest. This passage from the Zohar describes the great care that was taken to enter there, and the fear and trembling that accompanied this mission, where any error might be fatal. Further, great importance lay in how well this mission went, for if the prayer of the High Priest is accepted, it is a sign that God has decided to show mercy to the people of Israel. Note the fascinating detail of the golden cord that is tied to the foot of the High Priest, in case it should become necessary to pull him out. This, in itself, shows how much was at stake in entering the Holy of Holies.",

The Days of Awe are the ten days in the month of Tishrei from Rosh ha-Shanah to Yom Kippur.

He would take seven challahs with him and a pitcher of milk, and he would return home only on the eve of Shabbat. Then he would start chanting the Song of Songs with great fervor.",
      "commentary": "While he was reciting the Song of Songs, there was a sound of flying wings all around. Everyone who was present there heard it. And when he was asked about it, the Or ha-Hayim said, \"Those are the souls I repaired during the week, while I was in the mountains.\" It was said that even when his wife threw out the crumbs of the challahs, the sound of wings could be heard, for those souls came to share the crumbs of the Tzaddik. Then, at the time of the Days of Awe, the Or ha-Hayim would leave Jerusalem. He would spend the eve of Rosh ha-Shanah alone in a hut on the shore of Lake Kinneret in the Galilee, and from time to time he could be seen entering the waters. When someone once asked him why he did this, he replied, \"I am assisting the souls that are here to immerse themselves in the Kinneret, to sanctify themselves before the onset of Rosh ha-Shanah.\" Those close to the rabbi understood that the Or ha-Hayim was engaged in restoring lost souls at the time of the Days of Awe. As the myth of the Ari teaches, the most important actions that Jews can take are those of tikkun olam, repairing the world. For rabbis such as the Or ha-Hayim (Rabbi Hayim ben Attar, known by the title of his biblical commentary, which means \"the light of life\") and Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, one of the most important duties of repair concerned raising up the souls of the dead who have somehow become trapped in this world. This theme is also found in \"The Field of Souls,\" p. 168. In \"Gathering Souls,\" the Or ha-Hayim does this holy work during the week by going off into the mountains alone, and he returns only for the Sabbath, when he is followed by flocks of the souls he has set free. The Or ha-Hayim was the most famous Jewish sage of his time living in the Holy Land. The Hasidim believed that the Ba'al Shem Tov had been barred by heaven from going to the Holy Land because the combination of his merits and those of the Or ha-Hayim, along with those of the Holy Land, would force the coming of the Messiah. This suggests that the Or ha-Hayim was regarded by the Hasidim as the equal of the Ba'al Shem Tov.",

      "title": "A Scapegoat For Azazel",
      "content": "And from the Israelite community Aaron shall take two he-goats for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. Aaron is to offer his own bull of sin offering, to make expiation for himself and for his household. Aaron shall take the two he-goats and let them stand before the Lord at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting; and he shall place lots upon the two goats, one marked for the Lord and the other marked for Azazel. Aaron shall bring forward the goat designated by lot for the Lord, which he is to offer as a sin offering; . while the goat designated by lot for Azazel shall be left standing alive before the Lord, to make expiation with it and to send it off to the wilderness for Azazel. The custom of sending a scapegoat out into the desert as an offering to Azazel is clearly a remnant of a pagan ritual. In Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 51, God identifies the scapegoat as an atonement for Himself: \"This he-goat shall be an atonement for Me, because I have diminished the size of the moon.\" See \"The Quarrel of the Sun and the Moon,\" p. 112, which concludes with God diminishing the moon. We should not overlook the strangeness of God feeling the need to atone. This is reminiscent of Jung's portrayal of God in Answer to Job. It is one more example of the kind of personification of God so commonly found in rabbinic sources, where God also studies Torah, suffers, mourns, puts on tallit and tefillin and prays. Who was Azazel, to whom the scapegoat was sent? This appears to be a remnant of a pagan myth in which Azazel was some kind of desert god. Thus the scapegoat represents a sacrifice to the forces of evil. In modern Israel, the phrase \"Lekh le Az az el\" means \"Go to hell!\" A description of the sacrifice of the scapegoat is found in B. Yoma 67a: \"On Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement) a goat was thrown off a high cliff in the desert, to atone for the sins of the Jews. A red ribbon was hung up in the Temple on that day. When the goat was thrown off the cliff, the ribbon turned white.\" This description links the Temple and the sacrifice of the scapegoat, viewing it as a kind of remote Temple offering. The transformation of the ribbon from red to white confirms this. Another scapegoat sacrifice is described in the Talmud (B. Hullin 60a). A goat was offered in the Temple on every Rosh Hodesh, the first of the month, as a sin offering brought to atone for God's shrinking the moon, a decision that God later came to regret. (See Numbers 28:15). Therefore, on every Rosh Hodesh, when the moon is small, a sin offering was brought to atone for that decision.",

Some say the purpose is to confuse Satan, the Accuser. What would happen if the shofar were not sounded at the beginning of the year? Evil would befall by the end of it, because the Accuser has not been confused. Others say that God made up a secret language, that of the ram's horn, which is only understood by Him, so that the Accuser should not know the pleas of His children. And all those who know the mystery of that secret language walk in the light of the countenance of God. For that is the very light cast on the first day, when God said, \"Let there be light\" (Gen. 1:3). , The sounding of the shofar causes God to rise up from the Throne of Justice and move over to sit in the Throne of Mercy.",

      "content": "On Yom Kippur, at the end of the afternoon prayers, when the sun is over the tree tops, it is time for the Closing Prayer. This prayer is known as the \"Closing of theGates.\" What gates are these? Thb ^ gates of the heavenly Temple . For when the earthly Temple was destroyed, God'sTiome was removed from this world. That is why all of Israel direct their hearts to heaven on Yom Kippur, praying for their prayers to ascend on high and be accepted with compassion before the heavenly gates are closed. At the end of the service, the reader says, \"The Lord, He is God\" seven times, and the congregation repeats the phrase after him. The seven times correspond to the departure of the Shekhinah who rested in their midst from evening to evening. Now they accompany the Shekhinah through the seven firmaments that praise the Creator, who dwells above them, as it is said, God ascends midst acclamation; the Lord, to the blasts of the hom (Ps. 47:6). This teaching, attributed to Rav, demonstrates the far-reaching consequences of the destruction of the Temple. Originally, the Closing Prayer on Yom Kippur corresponded to the closing of the gates of the Temple. This myth from the Jerusalem Talmud suggests that when the Temple existed, the people directed their hearts to the Temple, believing it to be the home of God in this world. But now that the Temple is in ruins, it is necessary to redirect one's heart to God in heaven, for the closing of the gates now refers to the gates of the heavenly Temple, which still exists, where prayers are offered daily to God by the angels.

      "content": "When the Temple in Jerusalem was still standing, a water libation took place during Sukkot, the Feast of Tabernacles. The water dripped down into a cavern that was under the altar. This cavern existed from the six days of Creation, and it went down into the very depths. When the angel in charge of water heard the water dripping down, he commanded the water reservoirs in heaven to give forth water, as well as those under the earth. In this way the water libation brought about abundant rain.",
      "commentary": "This myth describes a Temple ritual intended to bring rain. Just as smoke rises from a sacrifice, and then the fire of the Lord descends to consume the burnt offering (see 2 Chron. 7:3), so here water is dripped upon the Temple altar, and, in turn, this brings about the release of water reservoirs in heaven and under the earth, resulting in rain. Thus the rain descends exactly as does the divine fire that consumes the offering. The myth also brings in the angel in charge of water, who releases the waters above and below.

      "title": "The Seven Shepherds",
      "content": "It is known that on the first night of Sukkot a mysterious guest sometimes appears in the booths of the righteous. This is none other than Abraham, who is the first of seven guests to appear, one on each night of the festival. On the second night Isaac appears, and on the third, Jacob. Joseph appears on the fourth night, Moses on the fifth, Aaron on the sixth, and King David on the last night of Sukkot. Blessed, indeed, are those who receive these guests, who are known as the Seven Shepherds. Every day of Sukkot one of these seven shepherds arrives at the sukkah as a guest. Before these celestial guests can appear, they must be invited with the following words: \"Let us invite our guests. Let us prepare the table. You shall live in booths seven days (Lev. 23:42). Be seated, guests from on high, be seated! Be seated, guests of faith, be seated!\"",
      "commentary": "Some say there is another visitor who is present for all seven days of the festival. That is the Shekhinah, who dwells in the sukkah of each righteous man as She once dwelled in the Temple in Jerusalem. She spreads Her wings over him from above, and Abraham and the other holy guests make their dwelling with him inside it. And one should rejoice on each of the seven days, and cheerfully welcome these guests to stay. All the other days of the year, the Seven Shepherds are not able to descend to the lower world. This happens only in a sukkah , when air from the upper worlds is drawn down, and the sukkah becomes the Holy of Holies, and the Shekhinah dwells in it. Only then can the Seven Shepherds descend and enter this world. Therefore, everyone who fulfills the mitzvah of the sukkah becomes a partner with God in the work of Creation. Through the making of the sukkah and making a place for the Shekhinah to rest, one fulfills God's intention to make a dwelling place below. Blessed is the portion of those who have merited all this. For it is said that those who welcome the celestial guests into their sukkah will rejoice with them both in this world and the next. The festival of Sukkot derives from a biblical injunction: You shall live in booths seven days (Lev. 23:42). Jews observe this holiday by building sukkot — booths — which have leaves and branches for a roof. During Sukkot Jews eat all their meals in these booths. There is a widely known tradition that the Ushpizin, literally, \"guests,\" who consist of seven patriarchal figures, come to visit the booths (sukkot) of righteous Jews during the festival of Sukkot, one on each night of the festival. These guests are known as the Seven Shepherds. When Jews leave their homes and enter the sukkah they receive the Shekhinah as a guest, along with one of the Seven Shepherds. Every night of Sukkot the prayer is recited that invites the guest to enter. They are invited with the words, \"Be seated, be seated you exalted guests.\" The patriarch Abraham is invited on the first day, and on subsequent nights Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joseph, and David are invited with the words \"May it please you, my exalted guest, that all the other exalted guests dwell here with me and with you.\" There are varying lists of the Seven Shepherds. According to Micah 5:4 and B. Sukkah 52b, they are Adam, Seth, Methuselah, David, Abraham, Jacob, and Moses. According to the Zohar (3:103b-104a), they are Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, together with Moses, Aaron, and Joseph, plus King David. Among some modern Jews there is a new custom of also inviting the four matriarchs, Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah, along with Miriam, Deborah, and Esther, or other female leaders of the Jewish people, to visit in the sukkah. For more background information about Sukkot, see the commentary to \"Dwelling in Exile,\" p. 300.",

      "content": "On Rosh ha-Shanah, the Day of Judgment, God sits in judgment of all the inhabitants of the world, and on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, He seals that judgment. Now it is possible that the judgment decreed for Israel will be banishment. That is why a sukkah is built right after Yom Kippur, for when the people of Israel build the sukkot, and then banish themselves from their homes to dwell in them, God considers this banishment equivalent to their dwelling in exile in Babylon, and therefore God continues to shelter Israel. So on the Festival of Sukkot, all of Israel goes to fetch myrtles and willows and palm branches and build sukkot and sing praises to God because He has atoned for them on the Day of Atonement. And on the first day of the feast God says, \"Let bygones be bygones. From this moment on commences a new reckoning. Today, the first day of Sukkot, is to be the first day of this new era of reckoning.\" Sukkot is one of the three Jewish pilgrimage festivals, along with Passover and Shavuot. In ancient times, before the Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, Jews in the Land of Israel tried to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem on these days to bring harvest offerings to the Temple. Of these three festivals, Sukkot most retains the character of a harvest festival. The lulav, a palm branch, and the etrog, a citron fruit, are carried during Sukkot services. During the seven days of Sukkot, some Jews eat and sleep in booths known as sukkot that are erected beside their homes or synagogues, or on rooftops of apartment buildings, with only leafy boughs serving for the roof. This is to remind them of the wandering of the Israelites in the wilderness during the time of the Exodus, when the people had to live in temporary dwellings.",
      "commentary": "This myth gives an additional and crucial symbolic meaning to the custom of building sukkot during the festival of Sukkot, and living in them for the duration of the holiday. The sukkot recall the 40 years of wandering of the Israelites, and the conditions of exile that they endured. Here also the sukkot are linked to the Babylonian exile. The new meaning that is added here states that God regards living in the sukkot to be the equivalent of living in exile. One effect of this myth is to give additional meaning to the ritual of building and living in sukkot. In this way, myth and ritual reaffirm each other. Note the role reversal in this myth, which has God atoning for the people, instead of the people atoning to God. This myth is also intended to highlight the quality of God's mercy, in which God both atones for and forgives the people for all their sins.",

      "title": "The Body Of Moses",
      "content": "Rabbi Hayim Vital once dreamed that it was the ancient custom of Israel to bring the body of Moses to the synagogue on Simhat Torah. The reason for this custom is that Simhat Torah is the day of rejoicing with the Torah that had been given through Moses. Furthermore, on this day the Torah portion that is read from Deuteronomy recounts the death of Moses. Now the day of the festival had arrived, and they brought the body of Moses to the synagogue in Safed. It took many men to carry the body inside the synagogue, for it was at least ten cubits long. Then the body, wrapped in a white robe, was placed on a very long table that had been prepared in advance. But as soon as the body of Moses was stretched out on the long table, it became transformed into a scroll of the Torah that was opened to its full length, like a long letter, from the first words of Genesis to the end of Deuteronomy. And in the dream they began to read the words of the Torah, starting with the creation, and they continued until they reached the last words, displayed before all Israel (Deut. 34:12). All this time the rabbi of Safed sat at the head of the table, and Hayim Vital sat at the foot. And in the dream it occurred to Hayim Vital that while the rabbi of Safed sat closest to the account of creation, he himself was closest to that of the death of Moses. And when the scroll of the Torah had been completely read, the scroll of the Torah became the body of Moses once again, and they clothed it and set a girdle around it. That is when Hayim Vital awoke, and for hours afterward it seemed to him as if the soul of Moses was present in that very room. This astonishing dream of Hayim Vital shows the close link in the Jewish mind between the Torah of Moses and Moses himself. In the dream the body of Moses is brought to the synagogue on Simhat Torah, which follows the seventh day of Sukkot and is a day of rejoicing. On Simhat Torah the year-long reading of the Torah comes to an end with the last few verses of the Book of Deuteronomy and starts again with the first verses of the Book of Genesis. This explains Hayim Vital's focus on the end of Deuteronomy and the beginning of Genesis. Note that the death of Moses is part of the Sephardic liturgy for Simhat Torah, and this may have inspired Hayim Vital's dream. Once the body of Moses, which is of gigantic proportions (as Moses was a giant among prophets — B. Berakhot 54b recounts that the body of Moses was ten cubits tall), is carried inside and put on a long table, it turns into the scroll of the Torah. Hayim Vital sits closest to the end of the Torah, where the account of the death of Moses is found. He assumes that because he is closest to this end, he is the closest to Moses. Once the Torah has been read from beginning to end, it turns back into the body of Moses. Hayim Vital had one of the richest religious imaginations in all of Jewish history, and in his dreams and visions the line between mythology and religion is completely erased, as here, where the Torah and the body of Moses are one and the same. In his writings he strongly hints that his master, the Ari, had a messianic role, and in his dreams, visions, and other writings he likewise attributes such a role to himself. In fact, he makes this connection explicit in his comments on the dream: \"This indicates there was a cleaving and connection between my soul and that of Moses.\"",

      "content": "Every year the followers of the Ba'al Shem Tov celebrated Simhat Torah with wild dancing and singing. For on that day the reading of the Torah is begun anew, and Jews dance with the Torah in their arms. Then one year his Hasidim noticed that the Ba'al Shem Tov did not join in the dancing, but stood off by himself. He seemed to be strangely somber on that joyful day. Suddenly a shoe flew off the foot of Rabbi Dov Baer as he whirled in the dance, and at that instant the Ba'al Shem Tov smiled. A little later the Hasidim saw the Ba'al Shem Tov pull a handful of leaves out of his pocket, crush them, and scatter their powder in the air, f illin g the room with a wonderful scent, like that of Paradise. Then the Ba'al Shem Tov joined in the dancing with great abandon. The Hasidim had never seen him so happy, and they, too, felt possessed by a greater joy than ever before. Afterward, when they had all caught their breath, one of the Hasidim asked the Ba'al Shem Tov what he had smiled about, after having been so solemn. He replied: \"While you were dancing, I went into a trance, and my soul leaped from here into the Garden of Eden. I went there to bring back leaves from the Garden, so that I could scatter them among us, making this the happiest Simhat Torah of all time. I gathered fallen leaves with the greatest pleasure and put them in my pocket. As I did, I noticed that there were scattered fringes of prayer shawls in the Garden, as well as pieces of worn tefillin, from the straps Jews wrap around their arm when they pray. Not only that, but I saw heels and soles and shoelaces, and sometimes even whole shoes. And all of these objects were glowing like so many sparks, even the shoes— for as soon as they entered the Garden of Eden, they began to glow. \"Now I was not surprised to see the fringes and straps, for they come from sacred objects, but I wondered what the shoes were doing there. \"Just then a shoe flew into the Garden of Eden, and I recognized it at once as that of Rabbi Dov Baer. The Ba al Shem Tov turned to face him. \"Dov, I realized that your love of God was so great that your shoe had flown all the way there. That is when I understood why there were shoes in the Garden of Eden. And that is why I smiled. \"I would have come back to join you at that very moment, but just then I saw two angels in the Garden. They had come to sweep and clean the Garden and to gather those precious, glowing objects. \"I asked the angels what they were going to do with the shoes, and one of them said: 'These shoes have flown here from the feet of Jews dancing with the Torah. They are very precious to God, and soon the angel Gabriel will make a crown out of them for God to wear on His Throne of Glory.'\" The Ba'al Shem Tov stopped speaking, and all who heard this story that day were filled with awe. Nor was Rabbi Dov Baer's shoe ever seen again, for it had truly flown to the Garden of Eden. Simhat Torah follows the seventh day of Sukkot and is a day of rejoicing. On Simhat Torah, the year-long reading of the Torah comes to an end with the last few verses of the",

Hearing these praises, God gains additional strength and power in the world above. Thus the children of Israel give strength to their Master, and His glory is exalted on high. That is why everyone must narrate the miracles and speak in God's presence of all He has done, for these words ascend, and the celestial house takes note of them, and God's glory is exalted both above and below. On Passover it is a requirement to read from the Haggadah , which narrates the Exodus from Egyptian slavery. The Haggadah gives the credit for the Exodus to God, only mentioning Moses once. This myth portrays God as reveling in the praises of Israel as they read from the Haggadah. It presents the kabbalistic concept of mutuality between God and Israel, where God does not only benefit Israel, but Israel's praise and prayers benefit God, who is said to gain strength and power from them.",

      "content": "Every Lag ba-Omer the Ari led his students to the grave of Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai in Meron. And there they danced at the resting place of the holy rabbi. Now one Lag ba-Omer, an old man danced with them. He could be seen swaying at the outer edge of the circle, as if he were being carried on waves of song. He had a beautiful white beard and was dressed all in white, with a white prayer shawl covering his head. His eyes were closed, and his whole body radiated mystical glory. All at once, the Ari took his hand and started dancing with him. A great light shone between them, a sacred radiance, like the light of many candles, tinged with blue and gold. All the students watched spellbound as the Ari and the old man danced. Their dancing lasted for hours. It was well after midnight when they stopped, and the old man took his leave. Then the disciples of the Ari crowded around him to learn the identity of the old man. And he told them that it was none other than Shimon bar Yohai himself who had joined in the celebration. On Lag ba-Omer campfires are lit all over Israel, but especially in the Galilee, in honor of Shimon bar Yohai. It was the custom of the Ari to go to the grave of Shimon bar Yohai in Meron to celebrate Lag ba-Omer. Here, while the Ari and his disciples dance and sing, they are joined by a mysterious old man, whom the Ari recognizes as Shimon bar Yohai. This tale links the greatness of the Ari and of Shimon bar Yohai, who are, in fact, the two primary sages associated with the Galilee. In this respect it is a kind of succession tale, showing that Shimon bar Yohai has selected the Ari to be his successor. This confirms the Ari's importance to be equal to that of Shimon bar Yohai, legendary author of the Zohar as well as the principal hero of its tales. This tale and others about the circle of the Ari collected by the Israel Folktale Archives demonstrate that the tradition still exists in the city of Safed in present day Israel.",

      "title": "The Wedding Of God And The Shekhinah",
      "content": "When they are first engaged, God sends His betrothed nuptial presents and a meal of celestial bread. So too does He make preparations for the wedding feast. On the eve of Shavuot, before the wedding takes place, the members of the heavenly household remain with the Bride all night, and rejoice in the preparations for the wedding. They study Torah, progressing from the Five Books of Moses to the Prophets, and from the Prophets to the Writings, and then to the midrashic and mystical interpretation of the text, for these are the adornments and finery of the Bride. Throughout the night, the Bride rejoices with Her maidens and is made ready by them. And in the morning She enters the bridal canopy, illumined with the radiance of sapphire, which shines from one end of the world to the other. Shining in all Her finery, she awaits each of those who helped to prepare Her. And at the moment when the sun enters the bridal canopy and illumines Her, all Her companions are identified by name. And God inquires after them, and blesses them, and crowns them with bridal crowns, and blessed is their portion. Then the Bridegroom enters the bridal canopy, and He offers the seven nuptial blessings and unites with His Bride, joining with the Queen in perfect union, and the heavens declare the glory of God (Ps. 19:2). This Shavuot myth describes the wedding of God and the Shekhinah. Since Shavuot commemorates the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai, it is the appropriate time for the wedding of God and the Shekhinah . The night of Shavuot is traditionally devoted to Torah study, including study of the mystical texts, and here that study is identified as the adornments of the Bride. Thus the scholars who study on the night of Shavuot are identified here as members of the heavenly household who remain with the Bride all night and assist Her in preparing for the wedding. The myth that follows, also a Shavuot myth, describes the wedding of God and Israel. Both versions are quite common, although the wedding of God and Israel, because of its appearance in the Sephardic Mahzor (holiday prayerbook), is the betterknown myth.",

      "content": "On Friday, the sixth of Sivan, the day appointed by the Lord for the revelation of the Torah to His beloved people, God came forth from Mount Sinai. The Groom, the Lord, the King of Hosts, is betrothed to the bride, the community of Israel, arrayed in beauty. The Bridegroom said to the pious and virtuous maiden, Israel, who had won His favor above all others: \"Can there be a bridal canopy without a bride? As I live — declares the Lord — you shall don them all like jewels, deck yourself with them like a bride\" (Isa. 49:18). Many days will you be Mine and I will be your Redeemer. Be My mate according to the law of Moses and Israel, and I will honor, support and maintain you, and be your shelter and refuge in everlasting mercy. And I will set aside the life-giving Torah for you, by which you and your children will live in health and tranquility. This Covenant shall be valid and binding forever and ever.\" Thus an eternal Covenant, binding them forever, has been established between them, and the Bridegroom and the bride have given their oaths to carry it out. May the Bridegroom rejoice with the bride whom he Has taken as His lot, and may the bride rejoice with the Husband of her youth. In the Talmud there is a brief description of the marriage of God and Israel: \"The Groom, the Lord, the King of Hosts, is betrothed to the bride, the community of Israel, arrayed in beauty\" (B. Pesahim 106a). Since all weddings are required to have a ketubah, a wedding contract, the present myth, \"The Wedding of God and Israel\" provides the wedding contract for that wedding. Its text serves as a hymn for Shavuot. This liturgical poem, found in the Sephardic prayer book for Shavuot, is based on the verses, \"I will espouse you with righteousness and justice , and with goodness and mercy, and I will espouse you with faithfulness ; then you shall be devoted to the Lord\" (Hos. 2:21-22), and \"I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel\" (Jer. 31:31). The text of this ketubah is read on Shavuot, usually in Ladino, from the Sephardic holiday prayer book, or Mahzor. It describes the Giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai as the wedding between God and Israel that is indicated by the verse \"See, a time is coming\" — declares Yahweh — \" when I will make a new covenant with the House of Israel and the House of Judah\" (Jer. 31:31). Here God and Israel are personified as a Bridegroom and bride, and the Torah is presented as the ketubah, or wedding contract, between them. The marriage takes place on the sixth of Sivan, the holiday of Shavuot, when, traditionally, the Torah was said to have been given.",
      "commentary": "Here the wedding that takes place on the Sabbath is not between God and the Shekhinah; instead, it is between God and Israel, with the ketubah serving as the wedding contract between them. The fact that the wedding takes place on Shavuot demonstrates the linkage of the Torah, given on Shavuot, to this bond. It is the Torah that both affirms the Covenant between God and Israel and also binds them together. Indeed, the ketubah that is read symbolically represents the Torah in much the same way as do the Ten Commandments. This text can be viewed both mythologically as the wedding between God and Israel, and allegorically, suggesting that the Torah can be viewed as a contract between God and Israel in the same way that a ketubah serves as a contract between man and wife. Deuteronomy Rabbah 3:12 states that it was Moses who wrote the ketubah between God and Israel, based on the verse And Moses wrote this Law (Deut. 31 :9). God is said to have rewarded Moses for doing this by giving him a luminous countenance. As for the scroll tiiat Moses wrote the ketubah on, the same source in Deuteronomy Rabbah describes it as made of a parchment of white fire, which was written on with black fire. Of course, this ketubah is none other than the scroll of the Torah itself. It is important to observe that God is masculine and the Shekhinah, feminine. An interesting parallel is found in Greek myth, where Uranus, whose name came to mean the sky, is masculine, and Gaia, who is Mother Earth, is feminine. In both cases, the feminine goddess figures are linked to the earth: the Shekhinah represents God's presence in this world, especially with the Temple in Jerusalem, and Gaia is, at the same time, the personification of the earth. The primary difference between them is that God's Bride is an invisible, supernatural being, while Gaia represents not only a goddess, but also the life-sustaining earth. Both pairs of gods and goddesses associate the masculine with the heavens, and the feminine with the earth. See The Greek Myths by Robert Graves, 3.1. God is portrayed as being wed to three different brides in various Jewish myths: to the Shekhinah (see \"The Wedding of God and the Shekhinah , p. 304), to Israel (as recounted here), and, remarkably enough, to Lilith (see \"Lilith Becomes God's Bride,\" p. 59). In most myths God is presented as being married to the Shekhinah.",

      "title": "The Parting Of The Heavens At Midnight",
      "content": "It is said that at midnight, on the night of Shavuot, the skies part, and the glory of heaven is revealed. Then anyone who makes a wish at that instant will have that wish come true. That is why students stay up all night studying the Torah, so that they will be awake when the skies part, and be worthy of viewing God’s glory at that instant. Just as the parting of the Red Sea is the key moment of the Exodus, celebrated at Passover, so the folk tradition of the parting of the heavens at midnight is linked with Shavuot (and sometimes Sukkot). The possibility of this miracle taking place is intended to motivate students to stay up all night studying. Shavuot represents the day the Torah was given, which was the defining moment in the history of Judaism. It was a kabbalistic custom to study the entire night of Shavuot. The text that is traditionally studied is the Zohar, the central text of Jewish mysticism, and the whole night of study is regarded as a ceremony of purification. The culmination of this ceremonial study is the revelation that takes place at the instant the skies open, revealing the glory of the Shekhinah to those worthy of seeing it. This miracle of the skies opening is also found as a theme in Jewish folklore, in which wishes are often made at the instant the skies open. These wishes, of course, always come true.",

      "content": "There will be seven cosmic eons in all, each lasting seven thousand years. In the present era, God's commandments are a necessity. But in the preceding eon there was neither desire nor reward and punishment, and a different law prevailed. At the end of the sixth eon, on the eve of the cosmic Sabbath, light will swallow death and drive unclean spirits from the world. Then everyone, great and small, will know God by the light that emanates from the mystery of divine thought. When the cosmic Sabbath begins, a new Torah will go forth, and a new cosmic law will prevail. Wisdom and knowledge will increase among men. The letters of the Torah will combine in a new way and take on a new meaning, but not a single letter will be added or taken away. Each of the eras of existence is known as a Shemittah, an era lasting 7,000 years. The cosmic eras of this myth find their source in the story of the creation, in which the seventh day is a day of rest, as well as in the agricultural law also known as Shemittah in which fields must lie fallow every seventh year (Exod. 23:10-11; Lev. 25:1-7, 18-22; Deut. 15:1-11). The Torah of the present era, known as the Torah of Creation, is different from that of the preceding or subsequent eras. The Torah of the past and future eras is known as the Torah of Divine Emanation. The suggestion that the Torah is somehow different in different eras echoes the idea that God will give a new Torah to Israel in the messianic era, which will be different from the present Torah. Some versions of this myth insist, as does this one, that \"not a single letter will be added or taken away.\" On the other hand, the myth of the twenty-third letter of the Hebrew alphabet asserts that there was an additional, although invisible, twenty-third letter from the beginning. It will only be revealed in the messianic era, and that will be the genesis of the new Torah, which will be given through the Messiah as the Torah given at Mount Sinai was given to Moses.

      "content": "On this day the Torah is crowned with jewels, and adorned with seventy branches of light, which shine on each of the seventy faces of the Torah. On this day the sound of rejoicing and delight is heard throughout the world, and pleasure and joy abound. On this day a breath of delight spreads throughout all the world, so that all those who observe the Sabbath can enjoy perfect rest. On this day all negative judgments are suppressed, and even the wicked in Gehenna are at ease. All powers of negativity vanish and no other power reigns in any of the worlds. On this day the voice of a herald proclaims, \"Arise, O celestial ones, arise, O holy people, arise in perfect joy to meet your Master! Blessed is your portion, Israel, in this world and the World to Come.\" Therefore all blessings above and below depend on the seventh day. For the Sabbath is equal in worth to the whole of the Torah, and whoever keeps the Sabbath is like one who keeps all of the Torah. This kabbalistic myth emphasizes the holiness of the Sabbath in heaven as well as on earth. The Zohar emphasizes that although the individual acts of creation were finished, the world was not perfect until the seventh day. That is why it is stated that God completed His work on the seventh day (Gen. 2:2). So potent is the blessing of the Sabbath that its delight spreads throughout the world and even cancels negative decrees, such as the punishments of Gehenna. So crucial is keeping the Sabbath that doing so it is said to be the equivalent of honoring all of the laws of the Torah.",

      "content": "Every seventh day her coronation takes place. Before the start of the ceremony, the dwelling place is prepared like the chamber of a Bridegroom set to receive his Bride. Meanwhile, the Bride herself remains alone, separated from the forces of evil. There she adorns herself with a crown for the Holy King, and prepares herself for their union. Then, as the Sabbath begins, the radiant Bride is escorted by angels on high and Israel below, and she is ushered into Israel's abode, to be in their midst. There she is crowned by the prayers of the holy people, and they, in turn, are adorned with new souls, so that they all are united above and below. This describes a mythical ceremony that is part coronation and part wedding between God and His Bride, the Shekhinah. The union, clearly intended to be understood as a sexual union, between God and His Bride, comes close to portraying them as independent mythic beings. This one passage from the Zohar can be subjected to many interpretations. It might be viewed as a union between two of the ten sefirot, those representing the marriage of the King and His Bride. At the same time, it is also an enthronement myth as well as a wedding. This heavenly ceremony is paralleled on earth by the ritual of Kabbalat Shabbat , going out to greet the Sabbath Queen at the beginning of the Sabbath. The Ari and his followers wore white, and left the city of Safed to go out into the fields to welcome the Sabbath Queen. Thus heaven turns to earth and earth to heaven, and they meet in a rare union of peace, which is the Sabbath. See the next entry, \"Greeting the Sabbath Queen.\"",

      "content": "It was the custom of some of the rabbis to greet the Sabbath Queen. Just before the sun set on the Sabbath, Rabbi Haninah would wrap himself in his robe, stand up, and say, \"Come, let us go to greet the Sabbath Queen.\" So too did Rabbi Yannai put on his festive gar•' ments on the eve of the Sabbath and say, \"Come, O Bride! Come, O Bride!\" And every Sabbath eve, at sunset, the Ari led his students to greet the Sabbath Queen as she descended the rolling hills outside of Safed. When they arrived at the hills, they began to sing the songs greeting the Sabbath Queen. And the melodies of those songs were carried upward on the wings of prayer, and formed a beautiful garland of prayers that the Sabbath Queen carried with her as she descended from on high. Many were those who saw them leaving Safed, every one dressed in white, and later saw them returning, singing Sabbath songs. The Ari based the Sabbath ritual of Kabbalat Shabbat on the two talmudic accounts of rabbis welcoming the Sabbath Queen. This custom is echoed today on the Sabbath evening when, before reciting the last stanza of Lekhah Dodi, the congregation turns around to face the door of the synagogue and recites \"Bo'i b'shalom\" (\"Come in peace\")",

As the Shekhinah hovers over them, wings outstretched. She brings forth new souls for each and every person. As this spirit descends, it bathes in the spices of the Garden of Eden and then settles upon the holy people of Israel.

Then great multitudes come before God and sing praises to Him, and go into synagogues, where they prostrate themselves before God.",
      "commentary": "This myth of the revival of the dead concerns the souls of the righteous who make their home in the Garden of Eden. Here the dead are described as making their homes in their graves, while in other sources the souls of the dead leave their graves for good within a year after they have died. The strange wandering of the souls of the dead on the Sabbath (and, according to some sources, the new moon) derives from the interpretation of the biblical verse: The people of the land shall worship before the Lord on Sabbaths and new moons (Ezek. 46:3). Even the souls being punished in Gehenna are released for the duration of the Sabbath. See Sabbath in Gehenna, \" p. 238. In the Ezekiel verse \"the people of the land\" (am ha-aretz) is interpreted to refer to \"those hidden in the earth,\" i.e., the dead, instead of the more obvious meaning of \"the common people.\" Note that the revival of the dead in this myth is not identical with the resurrection of the dead that is to take place in the messianic era. This revival is temporary, and ends with the end of the Sabbath, while that of the messianic era is permanent. The fate of the righteous on the Sabbath is different, however. B. Berakhot 18a states that \"In their death, the righteous are called living.\" And in B. Ketubot 103a it is said that after his death Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi used to visit his earthly home at twilight on every Sabbath, wearing his best clothes, and recited Kiddush for his family like a living person.",

      "content": "When Jews keep the Sabbath, their souls enter the Garden of Eden. Together with the pure souls and the souls of the righteous that inhabit that realm, the soul of the Jew delights in the light of the Garden and feels the bliss emanating from the radiance of supernal love. In this way the soul enjoys the bliss of Paradise that the Sabbath brings. This supernal bliss is felt both within and without the body, and is drawn into this world. Indeed, the flavor of the Sabbath is even absorbed into the food that is tasted on that day. That is why it is said: \"We have a certain spice; Sabbath is its name. Whoever keeps the Sabbath is affected by it and whoever does not keep the Sabbath is not affected by it.\" On the Sabbath, Jewish souls are said to ascend to Gan Eden , the Garden of Eden, which is already inhabited by the \"pure souls\"— that is, souls in the garden that never participated in the tasting of the forbidden fruit — as well as the souls of the righteous who make their home there. While the body of the Jew celebrating the Sabbath is on earth, his or her soul is in heaven, for Gan Eden refers to the celestial Paradise. This explains why the Sabbath meal has such an exceptional flavor and why the Sabbath itself is a delight.",

      "content": "Early in the morning Moses went to Mount Sinai as the Lord had commanded him, and took in his hand two tablets of stone. Yahweh came down in a cloud ; He stood with him there , and proclaimed the name Yahweh (Exod. 34:5). And God drew His robe around Him like the reader of a congregation and showed Moses the order of prayer, and taught him the Thirteen Attributes of God. And Moses made haste , and bowed his head toward the earth , and worshipped (Exod. 34:8). The biblical account of God descending to Moses is amplified and transformed in the Talmud, where God is described drawing His robe around Him as was the custom of the reader in a congregation. This image grows out of the fact that the Thirteen Attributes of God are incorporated into the prayer service, and the meeting of God and Moses on the top of Mount Sinai is here transformed into the terms find perspective of the synagogue or house of study, where God shows Moses the order of the prayers, and explains His own Thirteen Attributes to him. The biblical passage itself is a daring one, with God coming down to earth as did the pagan gods. The talmudic addition humanizes it further, portraying God in the role of a rabbi /teacher or even a fellow congregant. The Thirteen Attributes of God are verses from Exodus 34:6-7 th at are read on fast days and at other times. According to the Talmud, God is said to have revealed them after Moses pleaded on behalf of Israel because of the transgression of the golden calf. In this way God was explaining that whenever Israel sins, if they recite this prayer, God will forgive them. Therefore a covenant was made with the Thirteen Attributes, that the people would not be turned away empty-handed, as it is said. Behold , I make a covenant (Exod. 34:10). Targum Pseudo-Yonathan on Exodus 34:5-6 states that rather than God revealing Himself to Moses, it is the Shekhinah that is revealed: \"The Lord revealed Himself in the clouds of the Glory of His Shekhinah .... The Lord caused His Shekhinah to pass before him.\" This suggests that the translator was uncomfortable with God having revealed Himself so directly to Moses, and instead turned to the tradition of the Shekhinah as God's Presence in this world. Targum Pseudo-Yonathan on Exodus 33:5, quotes God as saying, \"Were I to remove the Glory of My Shekhinah for one short moment among you, the world would come to an end.\"",

      "content": "The first Sabbath was also the first New Year's Day. On that day, the first of Tishrei, the daylight continued for thirty-six hours, since night did not fall at its set time. For God gave the first Sabbath an extra twelve hours of light by holding back the darkness. That is the meaning of the verse And God blessed the seventh day (Gen. 2:3). What did God bless it with? With an extra measure of light. Why did God hold back the darkness? Because of Adam, who was created on the sixth day He had never seen the darkness, and God did not want to cause him distress. Thus the light of the first Sabbath was like the primordial light of the first day of creation, in which it was possible to see from one end of the universe to the other, for on both days the light lasted and the darkness was held back. Here Rosh ha-Shanah, the New Year, is linked to the first Sabbath, making it the birthday of the world. Note that this birthday is not calculated from the first day of Creation, but from the day of rest that follows the six days of Creadon. This date is identified as the first of Tishrei, which is the day on which Rosh ha-Shanah is celebrated. The sun shining for an extra twelve hours so that Adam would not be frightened of the darkness adds to the miraculous nature of the first Sabbath.",

Soon after the Sabbath was created, God said to all the angels of the presence and all the angels of sanctification: \"We shall keep the Sabbath together in heaven and on earth.\" He said: \"Know that I shall separate a people from among all the nations for Myself, and they will also keep the Sabbath. And I will sanctify them for Myself, and I will bless them. They will be My people and I will be their God. And I have chosen the seed of Jacob from among all that I have seen.\" God observed the first Sabbath on the seventh day of Creation (Gen. 2:2), and The Book of Jubilees assumed that He has been observing it ever since. This myth offers another example of how God is portrayed as performing Jewish rituals in heaven. Such a myth underscores the importance of the ritual activity, in this case the Sabbath. It also underscores the importance of keeping the Sabbath along with God, who observes it in heaven. For other examples, see \"God Puts on Tallit and Tefillin,\" p. 34, and \"God Studies the Torah,\" p. 34. Note that God also commands the angels to join Him in the Sabbath observance.

      "content": "When a man who is praying on the eve of the Sabbath says. The heaven and the earth were finished (Gen. 2:1), the two ministering angels who accompany every man place their hands on his head and say, \" Your guilt shall depart and your siri be purged away \" (Isa. 6:7). So, too, on the eve of the Sabbath, two angels accompany a man home on Sabbath evening after leaving the synagogue: a good angel and an evil on e. When he returns home, if he finds the candles bumin^and the table set, and the Bedding properly arranged, the good angel says, \"So may it be for another Sabbath,\" and the evil angel is forced to reply, \"Amen.\" But if everything has not been properly prepared for the Sabbath, the evil angel states, \"So may it be for another Sabbath,\" and the good angel has no choice but to say, \"Amen.\" And some say that not only the two angels accompany a person from the synagogue on the eve of the Sabbath, but that the Shekhinah accompanies him as well, like a mother bird sheltering her children. When the Shekhinah sees the candles burning and the angels behold the set table, and sees that the husband and wife are filled with joy for the Sabbath, the Shekhinah says, \" You are my servant , Israel in whom I glory \" (Isa. 49:3). But if the candles are not burning, the table is not set and the husband and wife are not rejoicing, the Shekhinah departs, taking the angels with Her. Then the forces of evil arrive to take their place, and the Evil Inclination proclaims, \"This household belongs to me and my forces.\" Then the spirit of defilement rests upon them and even their food is rendered impure.",
      "commentary": "This is a famous midrash that is intended to remind Jewish families of the importance of properly observing the Sabbath. Unless they want the evil angel to have the last word, they have to make the proper preparations for the Sabbath. It is customary, in both the Sephardic and Ashkenazi traditions, to recite or sing the piyyut or hymn Shalom Aleikhem, meaning \"peace unto you,\" on Friday evening after returning from the synagogue. This hymn, composed approximately 250 years ago by an unknown poet, and introduced into the Sabbath service by the kabbalists, serves as a reminder of the cautionary tale of the two Sabbath angels. Sha'arei Rahamim explains that the angels are compelled in what they do: \"The angels have no free will of their own, for they are not free agents, but they act solely by necessity. If a man is worthy, they must bless him, even against their will, and if he is not worthy, they must of necessity curse him.\"",

      "content": "The angels celebrate the Sabbath in heaven exactly as it is done on earth. Thousands of angels gather in the fourth heavenly palace, in the place known as the Chamber of Delight. During the festive meal on the night of the Sabbath, Sabbath tables are arranged there for the angels, who stand beside their tables, observing the Sabbath. They are watched over by a certain heavenly creature, with four seraphim serving under him, who resides in the fourth heavenly palace. This creature has been appointed to watch over those who rejoice on the Sabbath. And when this creature or one of the seraphim who serve under it sees those at a certain table rejoicing over the Sabbath, the heavenly creature blesses and protects them and spares them from the River of Fire. The aneelic celebrants, in turn reply \"Amen.\" But should the heavenly creature see a table that is not rejoicing in proper fashion, then the seraphim force those angels outside that chamber, and usher them into a realm known as the Chamber of Harm. There, instead of being blessed, they are cursed, and there is none to protect them from the River of Fire.",
      "commentary": "Here the Sabbath is described as being celebrated in heaven by the angels just as it is on earth. And just as human celebrants are judged by two angels (see \"The Sabbath Angels,\" p. 315) or by the Shekhinah along with the two angels (ibid.), so here the angels are judged by one of the hayyot or heavenly creatures, along with four assistant seraphim. The angels receive a blessing from the heavenly creature if their observance is appropriate, but are destroyed in the River of Fire if they are found at fault. Angels that have somehow displeased God are said to meet their end in the River of Fire. This image derives from Daniel 7:10: A river of fire streamed forth before Him.

From the Garden of Eden. Ever since they took leave of this world, the patriarch Abraham and his wife, Sarah, have made their home in the Garden of Eden. During the week Abraham wanders through the Garden and gathers leaves that have fallen from the trees of Eden, especially those of the Tree of Life. And on the eve of the Sabbath, Sarah crushes those leaves and takes the powder made from them and casts it into the wind. And winds guided by angels carry it to the four comers of the earth, so that all those who breathe in even the smallest speck have a taste of Paradise, and the Sabbath is filled with joy for them. That is the spice of the Sabbath. The notion of a spice called Shabbat, that is. Sabbath, is presented satirically in the Talmud. When the Emperor Hadrian asks why Sabbath food is so fragrant. Rabbi Joshua ben Haninah tells him of such a Sabbath spice, which he said works for anyone who keeps the Sabbath, but not for anyone else. Despite the playful quality of his comment, the notion of a Sabbath spice entered the tradition, and a folktale about Abraham and Sarah living in the Garden of Eden offered an explanation for the spice pervading the Sabbath.",

But the Sabbath, a day of peace as well as a day of rest, resolves the conflict by prostrating herself before God, and assuring God it is good for Him to receive praises. This has the effect of sparing Adam God's anger.

      "title": "Why Women Light Two Candles On The Sabbath",
      "content": "Some say that women light candles on the Sabbath to repent for the sin of Eve. Because she extinguished the primordial light and made the world grow dark, women must kindle lights for the Sabbath. Others say that because two souls shine on the Sabbath, a person's soul and the neshamah yeterah, the second soul that is given on the Sabbath, women light two candles. Still others say that women light two candles because the Sabbath is celebrated above and below, in heaven as well as on earth. Just as the priest lit seven lamps in the Tabernacle and thereby caused the seven lamps on high to shine, so too does the kindling of the Sabbath candles awaken great arousal in the upper world. Above all, the two candles are kindled to honor the presence of the Shekhinah, die Sabbath Queen, who rests upon the people during the Sabbath. This explanation of why women light the Sabbath candles is found in Tkhine imrei Shifreh, a collection of women's devotional prayers, written in Yiddish, called tkhines. They were written in Yiddish because it was the vernacular, and women often didn't know Hebrew. Although there is some scholarly debate about whether various collections of these kinds of prayers were composed by women or by men, this collection is attributed to a woman, Shifrah Segal of Brody. The rabbinic explanation for the two candles describes the lighting of the candles as an act of repentance for the sin of Eve. But some tkhines dispute that, offering instead positive reasons for the ritual — to honor the two souls of the Sabbath, to awaken Sabbath joy above and below, and to honor the Shekhinah, who is said to be present during the Sabbath. The description of the lighting of the seven lamps of the Tabernacle is found in Numbers 8:2. For more on the myth that the primordial light was withdrawn because of the sin of Adam and Eve see \"The Light of the First Day,\" p. 83. For the myth of the second soul given on the Sabbath, see \"The Second Soul,\" p. 310.",

Adam took the stones and struck them together until fire shot forth from them. In amazement, Adam recited the prayer, \"Blessed are You, O God, Who created the light of the fire.\" And those words are still repeated in the Havdalah prayer till this day. Others say that a pillar of fire was sent to Adam to illuminate him and to guard him from all evil.

Who creates the flames of fire.\" And when he removed his hands from the light of the fire, he said, \"Now I know that the holy day has been separated from the work day here below, for fire may not be kindled on the Sabbath day.\" And at that hour he said, \"Blessed are You, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who divides the holy from the profane, the light from the darkness.\" And that is the prayer, till this day, that serves to separate the holy from the profane. One must also say the blessing over fire because all fires are concealed on the Sabbath, and once this blessing is made, all of the other fires emerge, take their places, and are given permission to shine. And when the blessing over fire is made, one must turn one's fingernails toward the flame, and let the flames reflect in them. One must also smell spices as the Sabbath ends, because when the second soul of the Sabbath departs, a person's soul is left naked, bereft of that spirit, and requires the scent of the spices to sustain the soul.",
      "commentary": "This is a midrashic example of a myth of origin. Never having seen darkness, Adam is terrified by its onset, and links it to the danger posed by the serpent of Eden. The identification of the serpent and the darkness derives from Psalms 139:11: Surely darkness will bruise me; the same verb, \"bruise,\" is used by the serpent in Genesis 3:15. This myth also provides the story behind the creation of the Havdalah ritual that is performed at the end of the Sabbath. Havdalah is the ceremony at the end of the Sabbath at which time the Sabbath officially ends, the Sabbath Queen departs, and Jews are said to lose their neshamah yeterah, their second soul. The rituals of Havdalah are described here: making a blessing over fire, letting the flames reflect in the fingernails, and smelling spices to revive oneself and let oneself recover from the loss of one's second soul.

      "content": "The world is destined to exist for six thousand years. The first two thousand years was the time of chaos, the next two thousand years the era of the Torah, and the last two thousand years will be the days of the Messiah. After that the world will lie desolate for a thousand years, before a new world is created in its place. For just as the seventh year is a year of release, so is it for the world: one thousand years out of seven it shall be fallow. Now it is known of God that in Your sight a thousand years are like yesterday (Ps. 90:4). Therefore six thousand years are but six days in the eyes of God. And just as God created the world in six days and then rested, at the end of six millennia the world will cease to exist.",
      "commentary": "Some say the world will remain desolate for a thousand years, just as land lies fallow every seventh year. But after this the world will be revived, as it is said. He will raise us up, and we shall be whole by His favor (Hos. 6:2). Others say that the six days of Creation represent all the days of the world, and the seventh day is the Great Sabbath, as it is said, a Sabbath of the Lord (Lev. 25:2). That will be the Sabbath of His Great Name. For the world as we know it was intended to exist for six thousand years: two thousand years without Torah, two thousand years with Torah, and two thousand years of the Messiah's reign. And just as one year in seven is a sabbatical year of release, so God will provide a day of release, a day lasting a thousand years. Thus, in the seventh millennium, the Great Sabbath will begin. Then all activity will cease. There will be no food or drink. But each and every one of the righteous will rejoice in his understanding of the Torah, and they will sit with crowns on their heads and feast off the splendor of the Shekhinah. At the end of this Sabbath year of days, the era of the World to Come will be ushered in, when death will never, ever again exist. For the World to Come will be wholly a Sabbath and everlasting rest. The Sabbath is said to be a foretaste of the World to Come. This myth, based on an interpretation of Leviticus 25:2, about the need to let the land lie fallow every seventh year, describes a cosmic Sabbath, known as the Great Sabbath, that will come after 6,000 years— three ages of 2,000 years each. Just as the seventh day is the Sabbath, the day of rest, so for a thousand years there will be no life in this world as we know it, but the righteous will reap great rewards in the World to Come. Note that the righteous are sustained in the World to Come by feasting off the splendor of the Shekhinah. Or, in an alternate version, the light they bask in is none other than the primordial light, the light of the first day. See \"The Light of the First Day/' p. 83. In this myth, the existence of the world is said to be limited to six millennia, and the longevity of the world is directly tied to the six days of Creation. This explanation draws on the verse in Your sight a thousand years are like yesterday (Ps. 90:4), which was taken as the precise correlation between time on earth and in heaven. Therefore the world that was created in six days will be destroyed at the end of six of God's days. Here the key is the symmetry between the six days of Creation and the span of the world's existence. This myth makes a distinction between the messianic era, which will last 2,000 years in this world, and the Great Sabbath that will follow, where all existence in this world will cease for good. In some versions of this myth, however, after lying fallow for a thousand years (some say 2,000 years), God will renew the world, and life will be revived (B. Sanh. 97a-b). In B. Sanhedrin 97b, Rabbi Hanan bar Tahlifa tells of seeing an ancient scroll on which was written: \"Four thousand two hundred and ninety-one years after its creation, the world will be orphaned. The years that follow will see the wars of Gog and Magog and the messianic age, but God will not renew the world until after 7,000 years.\"",

      "commentary": "This myth concerns the origin of the many tragedies that have come to be associated with the Ninth of Av. This includes the destruction of both Temples and many other catastrophes. Here the beginning of the curse of the Ninth of Av is traced to the report of the spies triggering panic among the people. This fear on their part was an affront to God, Who had promised to bring them into that land, provoking God to place a curse on the Ninth of Av. This myth is unusual, in that God is rarely portrayed making a curse. In fact, one myth describes an angel, Gallizur, whose job it is to utter all of God's evil decrees for Him.

      "content": "On the night of the Ninth of Av, while Jews mourn the destruction of the Temple at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem and the sound of their weeping cleaves the heavens, a white dove appears in the darkness of the night and joins the people of Israel in their mourning. All night it stands at the comer of the Wall, wailing and moaning. Then a heavenly voice is sometimes heard, moaning like a dove, saying, \"Alas, because of the sins of My sons I destroyed My house, I burned My sanctuary, and scattered My children among the nations.\" Here God is said to appear in the form of a white dove at the Kotel, the Western Wall of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem that is the only remaining wall of the Temple. The dove can be identified with God because, according to Jewish tradition, it was God who made the decision to destroy the Temple. In other accounts, this dove is identified with the Shekhinah, and is one of the three prominent forms She takes: as a bride dressed in white; as an old woman dressed in black, deep in mourning; and as a white dove mourning at the Wall. According to Zev Vilnay, the tradition of the mourning dove at the Wall grows out of the talmudic account in B. Berakhot 3a, in which Rabbi Jose, who lived about a century after the destruction of the Temple, prays in a ruin in Jerusalem and hears a voice like that of a dove, repeating words of regret at the destruction and exile. In later folk accounts, this dove is transferred to the Wall and linked with Tisha be-Av, the Ninth of Av, which commemorates the destruction of the two Temples.",

      "content": "On the night of the Ninth of Av, drops of dew can be seen on the stones of the Wailin g Wall, and it is said among the people that the Wall was crying at night for the Temple that was tom down. Once, when worshippers stood in front of the Wall, pouring out their hearts, water began oozing out of the cracks of the Wall, and the people cried out, \"The wall is weeping!\" When the news spread among the people, they streamed to the Wall, and women collected the tears of the Wall as a precious remedy for many ailments. That is why it is said that since the destruction of the Temple, the gates of prayer have been closed, but the gates of weeping are open. The western retaining wall of the Temple Mount is known as the Kotel, or Western Wall, or Wailing Wall. It is the holiest Jewish site in the world, and the focus of visitors to Jerusalem, who often pray intensely at the Wall and leave messages to God in the cracks of the Wall. Why is the Kotel known as the Wailing Wall? The name \"Wailing Wall\" is perhaps an outsider's description based on the passionate weeping of the Jews who pray there, since Jews normally call it the Kotel , the Western Wall. This myth, collected orally in Israel, provides a different kind of explanation, a miraculous weeping of the wall, still grieving over the destruction of the Temple.",

      "content": "When the Temple in Jerusalem was still standing, a goat was offered up as a sin offering on every Rosh Hodesh . This was brought to atone for God's sin. God said: \"At first the moon was same size as the sun. Later, I decided to make the moon smaller. Now I regret doing that. So on every Rosh Hodesh , when the moon is small, bring a sin offering for Me, to atone for My act of making the moon smaller.\" The goat offering on Rosh Hodesh is described in Nu mbers 28:1 4-15: This is the burntoffering of every new moon throughout the months Sftfifyear. And one he-goat for a sinoffering to Yahweh shall be offered. This astonishing myth has God confessing that He has committed a sin, or at least an act He regrets — shrinking the size of the moon. The possibility of God's reversing the decision is never considered. Even stranger, it is incumbent on the Temple priests to atone for God's sin by offering a goat as a sin offering on Rosh Hodesh . Rosh Hodesh celebrates the new moon. This, the first day of the month, is the day that the moon appears to have shrunken to its smallest size. This shows that Israel does not only repent for its own sins, but for the sins of God as well, for which God seeks atonement. For the myth of the shrinking of the moon, see \"The Quarrel of the Sun and the Moon,\" p. 112.

Everything that was brought forth, created, formed, and made, everything that God did, was for the sake of His holy people Israel. Israel was the first thing that arose in God's thought. That is why the sages commented about the verse In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth (Gen. 1:1), that \"beginning\" means Israel, since God's first thought was of Israel. After the souls of Israel had been created, God was required to create and maintain the universe, for this was the purpose for which He had brought the souls of Israel into being. God foresaw the pride and delight He would receive from Israel, and it was because of this that God created the world. God perceived that Abraham would some day be bom, and perform deeds of love and kindness. Thus God created a world of love out of His love for Abraham. Indeed, every detail of creation was brought into being because of some element of pride that God would have from His people. Even the sinners of Israel were included in God's pride. Thus every single Jew is a garment for the Divine Presence. The stars in the sky appear very small, but in heaven they are actually quite large. The same is true of Israel. In this world, Israel appears very small. But in the world on high, it is actually quite large. When God created the world, it did not have the power to endure. God created Israel so that the world would be able to endure, for Israel is the sustenance of all universes. If not for Israel, everything would revert to its original state of nothingness.",
      "commentary": "This myth expands on the notion of Israel as God's Chosen People by stating that \"Israel was the first thing that arose in God's thought\" and that \"The world was created only for the sake of Israel.\" The Maggid of Mezrich compares the relationship of God and Israel to that of a father and his child — it is a relationship of love, pride, and delight: \"When a father loves his child, this great love causes the child's image to be engraved on the father's mind. It is known that Israel rose first in God's thought. This means that it is constantly engraved in the Supernal thought, just as a child is in his father's mind.\" Here Israel is described as the First Created Being. There are several other divine beings who are described in these terms, among them the Heavenly Man, Adam, Adam Kadmon, and the Shekhinah. In this case, however, it is not an individual divine being who is identified as the First Created Being, but a nation, a people, whose destiny is interwoven with that of their God.",

See \"Adam's Soul,\" p. 162. A parallel idea is found in the myth of the Innocent Souls— souls that hid in the Garden of Eden at the time that Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, and thus were not tainted by their sin. The soul of the Ba'al Shem Tov was said to be one of these Innocent Souls.",

All of Israel is described as being attached to the Tree of Life. All of Israel heard God speak at Mount Sinai and all of Israel was said to have sung as one when it sang the Song at the Sea. All of Israel is responsible for the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem. And all of Israel must participate in raising up the Shekhimh from Her exile. Here Israel is viewed as more than a nation or a people, but as one body, since, in the eyes of God, Israel, His people, is rewarded and punished as if they were one. Note the parallel of this concept to the Christian doctrine of Corpus Domini, where each member of the church is a member of the body of God. This is a key concept that is also found in other sources. In the myth of the Ari, the combined efforts of all of Israel are required in order to gather the holy sparks that had been scattered around the world, so that the messianic era may be initiated. See \"God's Image,\" p. 33; \"The Fruit of the Tree of Life,\" p. 402; \"The Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks,\" p. 122; and \"The Shekhimh Within,\" p. 63.",

But because of his great faith, Abraham uproots himself and leaves Haran and sets out on a journey to the Holy Land.

Most recently, Israeli settlers have asserted this claim, which many regard as the root issue of the Arab-Israeli conflict.

      "content": "The Lord appeared to Abraham by the terebinths of Mamre; he was sitting at the entrance of the tent as the day grew hot. Looking up, he saw three men standing near him. As soon as he saw them, he ran from the entrance of the tent to greet them and, bowing to the ground, he said, \"My lords, if it please you, do not go on past your servant. Let a little water be brought; bathe your feet and recline under the tree. And let me fetch a morsel of bread that you may refresh yourselves; then go on— seeing that you have come your servant's way.\" They replied, \"Do as you have said.\" Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, \"Quick, three seahs of choice flour! Knead and make cakes!\" Then Abraham ran to the herd, took a calf, tender and choice, and gave it to a servant-boy, who hastened to prepare it. He took curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared and set these before them; and he waited on them under the tree as they ate. They said to him, \"Where is your wife Sarah?\" And he replied, \"There, in the tent.\" Then one said, \"I will return to you next year, and your wife Sarah shall have a son!\" Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent, which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years; Sarah had stopped having the periods of women. And Sarah laughed to herself, saying, \"Now that I am withered, am I to have enjoyment— with my husband so old?\" Then the Lord said to Abraham, \"Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Shall I in truth bear a child, old as I am?' Is anything too wondrous for the Lord? I will return to you at the time next year, and Sarah shall have a son.\" Sarah lied, saying, \"I did not laugh,\" for she was frightened. But He replied, \"You did laugh.\" The visit of the three angels to Abraham is one of the most important episodes in the Bible. It is here that Abraham demonstrates his great hospitality to the three visitors, and it is here that the promise that Sarah would give birth is made, despite the fact that both Abraham and Sarah were quite old. Sarah is so skeptical of this prophecy that she laughs, and her laugh is immortalized in Isaac's name, which means \"to laugh.\" This, then, is a crucial stage in fulfilling God's promise to Abraham that his offspring would be like the sands of the shore and the stars of the sky, and this promise is fulfilled in a miraculous form, by having the couple become parents in their old age. Note that while the men who arrive at Abraham's tent are identified as angels, it is God who says, \"Wliy did Sarah laugh?\" This indicates that two versions of this episode have been combined together, one in which Abraham's guests were angels and another in which God Himself comes to visit him, accompanied by two angels — the two angels who then set out for Sodom, to inform Lot, Abraham's nephew, that the city was about to be destroyed.",

      "title": "Abraham's Vision Of God",
      "content": "On the third day after Abraham circumcised himself, the Lord appeared to him (Gen. 18:1) as he sat in the door of his tent. As God spoke to him, Abraham was transformed, and became a full-fledged prophet. After that, the Shekhinah spoke from his throat, and God's presence remained with him. So too did God show Abraham each generation and its leaders, as He had shown Adam. Prior to his circumcision, Abraham's prophetic experience was purely visionary, but now the voice of prophecy issued forth from his lips, and he enjoyed a measure of the Holy Spirit, for the Voice of God was revealed in his speech. After this Abraham did not only receive messages from God, but he was able to initiate communication with God as well. As a result of the circumcision, Abraham had become an even holier person, capable of receiving a visit from God while remaining seated and fully awake, even during the hottest time of the day So too was he able to absorb a vision of God in His superior light. For not all visions are of the same caliber — this vision was of a superior nature compared to the previous ones. For once Abraham was circumcised, he attained the fullest possible prophetic vision. Then, just as God had shown Adam each generation and its leaders. He also showed each generation and its leaders to Abraham, as well as each generation and its sages.",
      "commentary": "Some say that God manifested Himself to Abraham that day by means of a tree, since the vision took place at the terebinths of Mamre. Why did God choose a tree to be the site at which He manifested Himself? To show Abraham that, like an old tree, he could still bear fruit. God's appearance to Abraham in Genesis 18:1 is the subject of much debate by commentators, since the matter spoken of is not mentioned. Rashi assumes that three days after his adult circumcision, God came to inquire about Abraham's well-being. On the one hand, the Zohar views this appearance as a mystical experience, which profoundly transforms Abraham into a prophet. On the other hand, Rashi views God as making a sick call. The role of God in this passage is further complicated by the fact that the same figure is sometimes identified as an angel and sometimes as God. Possibly two variants of the myth were combined, without resolving their inherent contradictions. The notion that God appeared to Abraham as a tree takes the interpretation in another direction. This is deduced from the reference to the terebinths of Mamre. There are some natural links between the two: one famous passage, associated with the Torah, states that she is a tree of life to those who grasp her (Prov. 3:18). God is so closely linked to the Torah, which is His creation, that any identification of the Torah with a tree might, at the same time, apply to God. It is also important to recall that the Canaanite goddess Asherah was linked to sacred groves, and therefore identified with a tree. A womblike shape was carved into the base of these trees. One question the rabbis wrestled with was whether Abraham circumcised himself, or if someone else did it. The question arises because of the great difficulty of any man circumcising himself. Although Genesis 17:24 seems to indicate clearly that Abraham did this himself. Rabbi Levi in Genesis Rahbah 47:9 asserts \"It is not written here that Abraham circumcised himself, but rather that he was circumcised by God.\" Zohar 1:96b describes a miraculous circumcision when Abram threw himself upon his face ; and God spoke with him further, “As for Me, this is My covenant with you \" (Gen. 17:3-4). And when Abraham arose, he found himself already circumcised.",

      "content": "Abraham wore a glowing stone around his neck. Some say that it was a pearl, others that it was a jewel. The light emitted by that jewel was like the light of the sun, illuminating the entire world. Abraham used that stone as an astrolabe to study the motion of the stars, and with its help he became a master astrologer. For his power of reading the stars, Abraham was much sought after by the potentates of East and West. So too did that glowing precious stone bring immediate healing to any sick person who looked into it. At the moment when Abraham took leave of this world, the precious stone raised itself and flew up to heaven. God took it and hung it on the wheel of the sun. This talmudic legend about a glowing stone that Abraham wore around his neck is a part of the chain of legends about that glowing jewel, known as the Tzohar, which was first given to Adam and Eve when they were expelled from the Garden of Eden and also came into the possession of Noah, who hung it in the ark. See \"The Tzohar, p. 85. This version of the legend adds the detail that the glowing stone was also an astrolabe, with which Abraham could study the stars.",

      "content": "There was a famine in the land, and Abraham and his wife Sarah went down into Egypt. First they went South until they reached Hebron, but since the famine was there as well, they made their way to Egypt, where there were said to be sufficient fruits and vegetables. Eventually they reached one of the seven branches of the Nile, and the night they entered Egypt, Abraham dreamed a dream. In the dream he saw a cedar and a palm that grew side by side. For many years they flourished together, but then men came who wanted to cut down the cedar, leaving the palm there alone. But the palm tree spoke to them, saying \"Do not cut down the cedar, for we are two of a kind.\" And they were so astonished to hear these words from a tree, that the cedar was spared for the sake of the palm. When Abraham awoke he was greatly afraid, for he knew that the dream must be a sign that his life was in danger. For surely he was the cedar and Sarah was the palm. He told Sarah his dream, and she too recognized its meaning. For Sarah was a great prophetess and interpreter of dreams. Sarah told Abraham that while the dream did signify that his life was in danger, it also indicated that he would be saved in the end, and somehow she would cause him to be saved. This prophecy came to pass when Pharaoh saw Sarah's beauty, and sought to kill Abraham, believing him to be her husband. Then Sarah assured Pharaoh that he was only her kinsman and Pharaoh agreed to spare his life. Thus did Sarah save Abraham, just as the cedar was saved by the palm.",
      "commentary": "This myth from Genesis Apocryphon, one of the Dead Sea Scrolls, serves to explain and justify Abraham's behavior in Genesis 12:10-20, when he identified Sarah as his sister rather than his wife. The use of dreams to convey a prophecy or a divine message is common, with the dreams of Joseph serving as the primary model. Note that this myth includes both the dream and the interpretation, as do the dreams of Joseph. The notion that Sarah was a great prophetess is widely found. In B. Sota 29a, it is stated that Sarah was the only woman to whom God ever spoke directly.",

      "content": "When Abraham was still known as Abram, he was a skilled astrologer, and he saw in the stars that neither he nor Sarah would beget a child. All the other astrologers confirmed that this was true. When God told Abraham that I will make you exceedingly fertile (Gen. 17:6), Abraham said, \"I have read in the stars that it is not possible that I should beget.\" God replied, \"What did the stars say to you? That Abram and Sarai will not beget? And you shall no longer be called Abram , but your name shall be Abraham (Gen. 17:5), and as for your wife Sarai , you shall not call her Sarai , but her name shall be Sarah (Gen. 17:15). For while Abram and Sarai will not beget, Abraham and Sarah will be fruitful.\" When God changed Abraham's name, he added a new letter to his name, the letter heh. Where did that letter come from? God took it from beneath the Throne of Glory and gave it as a crown to the soul of Abraham. And Abraham received that crown when God said the words, \" And you shall no longer be called Abram \" (Gen. 17:5). After that Abraham was a new person, for his soul had been infused with the crown of that letter, and that letter brought with it the breath of life. And God said to Abraham: \"Because of the letter that has been added to your name, the heavens will be in your control and all the stars and constellations that give forth light will be subjected to you.\" Ever since, anyone who studies the Torah nullifies the power of the constellations over himself, as long as he studies it in order to fulfill its commandments. But those who do not study the Torah remain subject to the influences of the stars and constellations. The tradition that Abraham was an astrologer was likely inspired by God's promise to Abraham: \"Look toward heaven and count the stars , if you are able to count them.\" And He added , \"So shall your offspring be\"(Ge n. 15:1-5). Abraham's role as an astrologer is also affirmed by the talmudic tradition that Abraham wore a glowing stone around his neck that he used as an astrolabe to study the stars. See \"Abraham's Glowing Stone,\" p. 332. The letter that Abraham receives as a crown to his soul functions much like an ibbur, the spirit of a departed sage that fuses with the soul of a living person. Here God gives Abraham the letter heh, taken from beneath the Throne of Glory, and fuses it with his soul, not only changing his name, but also his soul. Thus the change in his soul is a gift from God, which transforms him into the Patriarch Abraham. Note the linkage of this myth to the nullification of the power of astrological forces over a person. This grows out of the tradition that when God gave the Torah to Israel, He removed control of the stars and constellations over them, since the Torah transcends the world. This demonstrates the rabbis' recognition of the widespread belief in astrological forces and their concern that people would put their faith in these forces rather than in the Torah.",

The resolution found in Targum Pseudo-Yonathan, the Talmud, and other rabbinic sources is that Sarah was Iscah, and that Iscah was a seer. This meaning is derived from the Aramaic root of Iscah, which denotes seeing. This led to the tradition that Sarah was a prophetess as great or greater than Abraham.

For I have singled him out, that he may instruct his children and his posterity to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is just and right, in order that the Lord may bring about for Abraham what He has promised him.\" Then the Lord said, \"The outrage of Sodom and Gomorrah is so great, and their sin so grave! I will go down to see whether they have acted altogether according to the outcry that has reached Me; if not, I will take note.\" The men went on from there to Sodom, while Abraham remained standing before the Lord.

Will You destroy the whole city for want of the five?\" And He answered, \"I will not destroy if I find forty-five there.\" But he spoke to Him again, and said, \"What if forty should be found there?\" And He answered, \"I will not do it, for the sake of the forty.\" And he said, \"Let not my Lord be angry if I go on: What if thirty should be found there?\" And He answered, \"I will not do it if I find thirty there.\" And he said, \"I venture again to speak to my Lord: What if twenty should be found there?\" And He answered, \"I will not destroy, for the sake of the twenty.\" And he said, \"Let not my Lord be angry if I speak but this last time: What if ten should be found there?\" And He answered, \"I will not destroy, for the sake of the ten.\" When the Lord had finished speaking to Abraham, He departed; and Abraham returned to his place.

      "content": "Sarah was not barren. Although she had not given birth to a child, she had given birth to souls, as it is said. And the souls they had made in Horan (Gen. 12:5). This myth is a rather strange commentary on Genesis 16:1, Sarah was barren. She had no children. The commonly understood meaning of the souls they had made is that it refers to converts to the one God of Judaism. In this interpretation, Abraham and Sarah were successful in gathering converts to worship the one God. Rashi explains that the souls they had made means they found converts and \"brought them under the wings of the Shekhinah.\" He explains that Abraham would convert the men and Sarah the women. This follows the literal meaning of the passage. The Zohar seeks an explanation for the repetition, since stating that Sarah was barren already indicates that she had no children. The second statement is thus explained in terms of Genesis 12:6, the souls they had made in Haran, suggesting that Sarah did give birth, but to souls, not to children. Thus Sarah is portrayed in the Zohar as a goddesslike figure who gives birth not to human children, but to souls. Zohar 1:79a explains that both Sarah and Abraham gave birth to the souls of converts while in Haran. Here the meaning of \"made\" is not quite as literal, as it is explained that Abraham converted the men and Sarah converted the women. In Megaleh Amukot, Rabbi Nassan Nata Shapira agrees that both Abraham and Sarah gave birth to souls, and he identifies them as the souls of future converts. According to Rabbi Shapira, Isaac also begat souls of future converts, as did Rachel. For all the years she was childless, she gave birth to souls in heaven. Strangest of all is the interpretation of Rabbi Tzadok ha-Kohen of Lublin, who interprets the souls that they had made as souls created from seed ejaculated during intercourse that did not conceive. He states that \"These souls are the souls of converts, like the souls Abraham and Sarah created (Sihot Shedim 1 in Sifrei Rabbi Tzadok ha-Kohen ). Seed \"wasted through masturbation,\" however, gives birth to evil spirits, demons, and liliyot, female demons of the night. Rabbi Shlomo Rabinowitz of Radomsk suggests an alternate origin for the souls of converts, linking them to Adam's sin: \"When Adam sinned, many precious souls were captured by the Sitra Ahra. These are the souls of converts. Thus in converting, these souls returned to their true destiny.\" As to how Abraham and Sarah gave birth to these souls, Rabbi Rabinowitz quotes Rabbi Menahem Recanati, who said that when Tzaddikim discover new meaning of the Torah, they create souls in the higher world.",

      "content": "One of the most sacred mysteries of the Torah concerns Isaac's true father. Although Abraham rejoiced when he learned that he was to become a father, the truth is that it was the Lord who begat Isaac. For the Lord visited Sarah and did to her as He had spoken, and she conceived. That is why God said, \"I gave him Isaac\" (Josh. 24:3) and formed him in the womb of her who gave birth to him.\" Nevertheless, Isaac resembled Abraham in every respect. It is said that Sarah was accustomed to bring forth children for God alone, restoring with gratitude the first fruit of all the blessings she had received, since she was a virgin when God opened her womb. For it does not say that Sarah did not give birth at all, only that she did not bring forth for Abraham, for she told him, \"The Lord has kept me from bearing\" (Gen. 16:2). So too is it said that Sarah herself was not bom of a human mother, but that she was bom of God, the Father and Cause of all things. Indeed, she transcended the entire world of bodily forms and exulted in the joy of God. Others say that Sarah s conception and the birth of Isaac took place on the same day, as it is said, Sarah conceived and bore a son (Gen. 21:2). For unlike others, the soul of Isaac was not conceived at one time and bom at another. A heavenly light appeared at his birth, as happened with Noah. So too was it God who named Isaac when He said, \"But My covenant I will maintain with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this season next year.\" (Gen. 17:21). For his name was ordained and written in the heavenly tablets. This was the only time that God named a child before he was bom. Isaac was conceived on Rosh ha-Shanah, the New Year, and his birth book place on the first day of Passover. On the day of Isaac's birth the sun shone with a splendor that had not been seen since the sin of Adam and Eve and will only be seen again in the World to Come. So too did all creation rejoice: the earth, the heavens, the sun, the moon, and the stars. For had Isaac not been bom, the world would have ceased to exist. Here Philo brings yet another perspective to the story of Isaac by revealing \"one of the most sacred mysteries\"— that it was God, not Abraham, who begat Isaac. Philo's belief in this strange interpretation of the conception of Isaac appears in at least six texts where Philo suggests that God was the true father of Isaac. Philo's interpretation perhaps influenced Christianity. Just as Jesus was said to be the son of God, so too is Isaac identified as a son of God. How does Philo arrive at this explanation? He interprets Sarah's comment that \"God has caused me laughter\" (Gen. 21:6) to mean that the Lord has begotten Isaac. He interprets \"has caused\" to mean \"begotten,\" and he substitutes Isaac for laughter, since ' Isaac\" means \"laughter,\" referring to Sarah's laughter in Genesis 18:12, when the angel said that she would have a child even though Sarah was 90 years old. Philo apparently wrote a now-lost text on Isaac, entitled De Isaaco. Goodenough speculates that “De Isaaco developed as its central theme the fact that Isaac was so completely at one with the power behind the cosmos that he typified joy\" (By Light, Light p. 154). The Christian parallel to this interpretation of Philo is obvious: God begat Isaac through Sarah just as God begat Jesus through Mary. Sarah herself is a kind of virgin in that she is childless. Did Philo mean to suggest a Jewish version of the myth of the birth of a Jewish savior? Not necessarily, in that Philo is quick to reduce the myth to allegory, by describing God as perfect in nature, sowing and begetting happiness in the soul. So too does Philo insist that Isaac was not bom a man, but as a pure thought. As a result, some readers might consider Philo's interpretation pure allegory, but Philo cannot escape the implications of his commentaries, making the mythic explanation of Isaac's birth unavoidable.",

      "content": "Some time afterward, God put Abraham to the test. He said to him, \"Abraham,\" and he answered, \"Here I am.\" And He said, \"Take your son, your favored one, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the heights that I will point out to you.\" So early next morning, Abraham saddled his ass and took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and he set out for the place of which God had told him. On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place from afar. Then Abraham said to his servants, \"You stay here with the ass. The boy and I will go up there; we will worship and we will return to you.\" Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and put it on his son Isaac. He himself took the firestone and the knife; and the two walked off together. Then Isaac said to his father Abraham, \"Father!\" And he answered, \"Yes, my son.\" And he said, \"Here are the firestone and the wood; but where is the sheep for the burnt offering?\" And Abraham said, \"God will see to the sheep for His burnt offering, my son.\" And the two of them walked on together. They arrived at the place of which God had told him. Abraham built an altar there; he laid out the wood; he bound his son Isaac; he laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. And Abraham picked up the knife to slay his son. Then an angel of the Lord called to him from heaven: \"Abraham! Abraham!\" And he answered, \"Here I am.\" And he said, \"Do not raise your hand against the boy, or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your favored one, from Me.\" When Abraham looked up, his eye fell upon a ram, caught in the thicket by its horns. So Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering in place of his son. And Abraham named that site Adonai-yireh, whence the present saying, \"On the mount of the Lord there is vision.\" The angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven, and said, \"By Myself I swear, the Lord declares: Because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your favored one, I will bestow My blessing upon you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars of heaven and the sands on the seashore; and your descendants shall seize the gates of their foes. All the nations of the earth shall bless themselves by your descendants, because you have obeyed My command.\" Abraham then returned to his servants, and they departed together for Beersheva; and Abraham stayed in Beersheva. The Binding of Isaac (Akedat Yitzhak) is one of the central episodes of the Bible. It is the subject of great debate and many midrashic versions exist. The most perplexing aspects of this narrative are God's command that Abraham sacrifice Isaac and Abraham's almost robotic willingness to fulfill it. Considerable tension exists between God's promise to Abraham that his descendants will be like the stars of the sky, and God's insistence that Abraham sacrifice the son through whom he expects that promise can be fulfilled (Gen. 17:19).",
      "commentary": "This biblical episode is especially difficult to explain to children, for it is impossible to justify a parent's sacrifice of his or her child. When stripped of its biblical quaintness, it is a terrible story, and similar ones about a parent murdering a child provoke nothing but horror. The biblical account is generally viewed as a divine test of faith, which Abraham passes, as Job does. Adam and Eve, who are subjected to another such divine test, fail it and are expelled from the Garden of Eden. One possibility is that this episode was originally a kind of boilerplate narrative, perhaps not Israelite in origin, about a human sacrifice to a god. The editors of Genesis, then, took this sacrifice narrative, inserted Abraham and Isaac, and instead of having the man slay his son, had an angel of the Lord stop him at the last moment, with an animal— the ram in the thicket— sacrificed in Isaac's place. The precedent set is clear: from this time on there shall be no more human sacrifices, but they shall be replaced by animal sacrifices. This remained the precedent until the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, after which even animal sacrifices were eliminated, since there was no remaining altar on which to perform the sacrifice.",

      "commentary": "Some say that Abraham saw a cloud enveloping the mountain and knew that was the place where God wanted him to sacrifice his son. Abraham asked Isaac if he saw anything, and Isaac pointed to the cloud hovering above the mountain. But neither of the two young men who accompanied Abraham and Isaac to Mount Moriah saw anything at all. Others say that Abraham said to God, \"Master of the Universe, upon which mountain?\" God replied, \"You will see My glory waiting for you. That is how you will recognize the altar.\" So it was that Abraham saw the place from afar. There he saw the glory of the Shekhinah standing on top of the mountain in the form of a pillar of fire reaching from earth to heaven. He asked Isaac if he saw anything and Isaac said, \"Yes, I see a pillar of fire reaching into heaven. When Isaac said this, Abraham knew that his son was acceptable as a burnt-offering.",

I'll give him to You as a sacrifice.\" At the age of one hundred, Abraham had a son and he named him Isaac. The boy grew and Abraham forgot his promise to God. After several years God came to Abraham in a dream and said, \"Abraham, you promised that you would give Me your son as a sacrifice.\" In the morning, when Abraham awoke, he remembered the dream, and he said to Sarah, \"I am going to take my son to study. Don't worry about him. He will be with me.\" Abraham took Isaac and went to the forest. They were both silent. But when they arrived, Isaac said, \"Father, why did you bring me here?\" Abraham said, \"My son, before you were born I had to make a vow that if I had a son, I would sacrifice him to God.\" Isaac said, \"Father, I am ready.\" So Abraham tied the hands of Isaac behind his back and laid him on the wood, and he took the knife in his hand and put it on Isaac's neck. At that instant Abraham heard the voice of God: \"Abraham, Abraham, leave the child. I have already received the sacrifice you wanted to give Me. Look, there is a sheep. Sacrifice it to Me instead of your son.\" So Abraham untied his son, caught the sheep, and sacrificed it to God. The oral retelling of the binding of Isaac from India makes some crucial changes from the biblical account. The most crucial is that in the oral version Abraham and God reach a bargain whereby God will give him a son, and Abraham will sacrifice the son to God. This is very different than the sudden demand by God in Genesis 22 that Abraham sacrifice Isaac. Nevertheless, this oral version ends as does the biblical one, with God stopping the sacrifice at the last minute, and an animal being sacrificed instead of Isaac. It is possible that this oral retelling of Genesis 22 may be closer to the original oral version of the myth than that found in the Bible, as it follows a folk pattern in which a parent desperate for a child vows to give that child to the god who provides it. See, for example, the story of the birth of Samuel in 1 Samuel 1:1-28. Also, Hannah makes a similar bargain with the Jewish God in 1 Samuel 1:11. Another example, closer to the spirit of the present tale, is \"The Black Hand\" in Lilith's Cave, pp. 197-198.",

      "title": "Satan At Mount Moriah",
      "content": "While Abraham and Isaac were traveling on the road to Mount Moriah, Satan appeared to Abraham in the guise of an old man and asked him where he was going. Abraham answered. To pray.\" The old man asked, \"Why then are you carrying wood, fire, and a knife?\" Abraham answered, \"We may spend a day or two there, and we will kill an animal, cook and eat it.\" Old man, said Satan, \"are you out of your mind? You are going to slay a son given to you at the age of one hundred! And tomorrow, when you do, He will tell you that you are a murderer, guilty of shedding your son's blood.\" Abraham said, \"Still, I would obey Him.\" And Abraham turned away from Satan. Seeing that he could not sway Abraham, Satan appeared to Isaac in the guise of a young man and said, \"Rim now for your life. Your old father has lost his mind, and he is planning to sacrifice you. All those fine things your mother prepared for you are to be the inheritance of Ishmael.\" But Isaac refused to pay heed to him and continued to travel with his father. When Satan saw that Abraham and Isaac had spumed him, he turned himself into a great river lying across their path. Abraham strode into the water, which reached his knees. Follow me, he said. By the time they reached midstream, the water was up to their necks. At that moment Abraham called out to God, and God rebuked Satan, the river dried up, and they stood on dry land. This midrash makes the underlying assumption that God and Satan have made a wager concerning Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac, much as they made a wager in the prologue to Job. God believes that Abraham will follow through on whatever He commands him to do, including the sacrifice of Isaac. Satan seeks to stop Abraham from going through with the Akedah, the binding of Isaac. First Satan takes the form of an old man, then a young man, then a river blocking their path. But all three attempts fail. One way of looking at this midrash is that it permits the rabbis to express through the mouth of Satan their doubts about God's command to Abraham. What Satan says to Abraham and Isaac makes good sense, and reflects rabbinic incredulity at God's command to Abraham to sacrifice Isaac. Since these doubts cannot be expressed directly, they are expressed indirectly by putting them in the mouth of Satan. These kinds of doubts are also found in some other midrashim, such as the blunt exchanges between Abraham and Isaac recounted in Ner ha-Hayim and Yalkut Shim’oni 1:101: \"Isaac said to Abraham, 'My father, what are you doing with me?' Abraham answered, 'I am going to carry out your Maker's will.' Isaac said, 'What will you say to my poor old mother?' He answered, 'I will tell her that Isaac has been slaughtered.' You will kill her and be guilty of her death,' said Isaac. 'Instead, when you have burnt me, take my ashes to my mother, perhaps she would find consolation in them.' 'So it will be,' said Abraham.\"",

Then Isaac broke forth into song. What song did he sing? The song of sacrifice.

      "content": "Even as Abraham bound his son Isaac below, so did God bind the princes of the heathens above and make them subservient to Israel. Yet they did not remain so bound, for Israel alienated themselves from God. God said, \"Do you think that those fetters are forever? When Israel breaks its covenant with Me, their fetters are broken.\"",
      "commentary": "Here God immediately rewards Israel when Abraham binds Isaac to the altar by binding the princes of the heathens — the angels who served as guardians to the heathen nations — thus making them subservient to Israel. But this fettering only lasts while Israel upholds its part of the covenant with God. When Israel fails to do so, God unfetters the princes, and the heathen nations take their revenge on Israel. Perhaps the most interesting thing about this myth is the parallelism between earth and heaven: just as Abraham binds his son, God binds the princes of the heathens. Other parallels between above and below are often found in the midrashic and kabbalistic texts, such as the parallels between the heavenly and earthly Jerusalem.",

      "content": "When Isaac was bound upon the altar, and Abraham's arm was upraised, with the knife in his hand, God called upon the Angel of the Lord and said, \"Tell him not to lay his hand on the lad, nor to do anything to him.\" And the angel called to him from heaven, saying, \"Abraham, Abraham, lay not your hand upon the lad.\" Abraham was terrified when he heard the voice, and he put down the blade. Thus was Isaac spared and a ram that was caught in the thorns sacrificed in his place. The Akedah, or binding of Isaac, was the subject of extensive midrashic revision.",
      "commentary": "While this retelling of Genesis 22:10-12 does not stray far from the biblical text, it changes the perspective from Mount Moriah, where Abraham is about to sacrifice Isaac, to heaven, where God calls upon an angel to stop Abraham from slaying Isaac. In The Book of Jubilees, this change in perspective is even more striking because it is the angel himself who tells the story, speaking in the first person. This is an excellent example of the midrashic method, where details missing in the biblical text— specifically, God ordering the Angel of the Lord to stop Abraham— are inserted to resolve any problems in the text. For another midrashic version of the Akedah, see \"Isaac's Ascent,\" p. 171.",

      "title": "Isaac's Vision At Mount Moriah",
      "content": "When Abraham bound Isaac at Mount Moriah, Isaac's eyes gazed at the heavenly angels. Thus Isaac saw the angels present there, but Abraham did not. As soon as the sword touched his neck, Isaac's soul departed. But when the voice of the angel rang out, \"Do not raise your hand against the boy\" (Gen. 22:12), his soul returned to his body. Abraham loosened his bonds, and Isaac stood on his feet. Then Isaac knew that there is a resurrection of the dead, and he said, \"Blessed are You, O God, who resurrects the dead.\" When Rebecca first saw Isaac, he was wrapped in a tallit, and his appearance was like an angel of God. Later, Isaac returned to Mount Moriah, and through his prayer he changed God's decree that his wife be barren for twenty-two years. For when Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife, Rebecca conceived. After Abraham died, God appeared to Isaac and blessed him. Nor did God appear to Isaac with the Merkavah, the Divine Chariot, but instead the Shekhinah rested directly upon him. So too did God give Isaac a taste of the World to Come while he was still in this world, and as a result the Evil Inclination had no power over him. Some of the most remarkable traditions concern Isaac. Very little is said about Isaac in the Torah. He is first encountered as a child (although later rabbinic tradition in Seder Olam Rabbah 1 and elsewhere claims he was 37 at the time of the Akedah ), and later, as an old, blind man on his deathbed, so little of his life between youth and old age is known. This very absence of narrative produces some strange traditions, such as that which asserts that Isaac was slain by Abraham at Mount Moriah and his soul ascended into Paradise for three years before he was reborn. See \"The Ascent of Isaac,\" p. 171. This myth, which runs counter to the central thrust of the Akedah narrative, that Abraham did not sacrifice Isaac, seems to have strong Christian echoes, especially in the use of the number three, specifically the three days after his death when Jesus was said to be resurrected. From a Christian perspective, the binding of Isaac was identified as prefiguring the passion of Jesus. The verse God Himself will provide the sacrifice, my son (Gen. 22:8) is understood in Christianity to mean that God will provide Himself— the Christian notion that Jesus and God are one, and that in sacrificing Jesus, God was sacrificing Himself.",

      "content": "Some say that Satan came to Sarah when Abraham and Isaac were on Mount Moriah, and showed her a vision of Abraham with his knife raised above Isaac. And when Sarah saw that terrible vision, she cried out and was choked and died of anguish. Others say that Satan came to Sarah in the guise of Isaac. When she asked what his father had done to him, Isaac told her that Abraham had taken him to the summit of a high mountain, built an altar, and laid out the firewood. He had bound Isaac on top of the altar, and took the knife to slaughter him. And if God had not told him, \"Do not raise your hand against the boy\" (Gen 22:12), he would already have been slaughtered. And even before Satan, disguised as Isaac, finished speaking, Sarah's soul departed. Sarah's death is recounted at the beginning of Genesis 23. There is no direct reference to the binding of Isaac in Genesis 22, but one of the rabbinic methods of interpretation was to assume that chapters next to each other were somehow related. Since no reason is given for Sarah's death in Genesis 23, it was understood to be related to the binding of Isaac. There is no mention in Genesis 22 that Abraham informed Sarah of his plans to sacrifice their son, and the shock of learning this might in itself be enough to kill her. Here Satan is held responsible for revealing Abraham's plans to Sarah, by showing her a terrible vision of Isaac bound on the altar and Abraham about to plunge a knife into him. The alternate version suggests that after Isaac returned, he told his mother what had happened, and this caused her soul to depart. In both cases, it is the binding of Isaac that is held responsible for Sarah's death.",

      "title": "The Cave Of M Achpelah",
      "content": "When the three angels, disguised as travelers, visited Abraham, he went outside to fetch a young goat to slaughter for them. But the kid ran away from him, and he had to chase it through the fields to the entrance of a cave that Abraham had never entered. The kid paused an instant and then disappeared inside the entrance and Abraham followed after it. At first the cave was low, so that Abraham had to bend down, but soon it opened into a beautiful chamber, illuminated by a mysterious light. There was a wonderful scent, like that of balsam. And there, in that chamber, Abraham found the bodies of Adam and Eve, lying on couches, with candles burning at their head and feet, and their bodies were perfectly preserved. Adam and Eve had chosen that cave as their place of burial, for it was the closest site to the Garden of Eden, and the scent that pervaded it was that of Eden itself, which drifted from the Garden into that cave. When Abraham emerged, he knew that he had stumbled on a very holy place, and he decided then and there to purchase the cave from Ephron the Hittite, as a burial site for himself and his family. So too did he spare the kid that led him there. And that is the Cave of Machpelah in the city of Hebron, where the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives are buried, in the chamber next to that of Adam and Eve. After Abraham was buried there, Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening (Gen. 24:63). This was the very field that Abraham had purchased near the Cave of Machpelah. When Isaac entered it, he would see the Shekhinah resting there and smell the heavenly fragrances that wafted from it. That is why he prayed there, and it was designated as a place of prayer.",
      "commentary": "This is an important legend that solves two problems. First, it provides a burial site for Adam and Eve, which is not found in Genesis. The wonderful scent is assumed to come from the Garden of Eden, and therefore it is understood that Adam and Eve chose to be buried as close to the garden as possible. Secondly, this legend explains why Abraham chose to buy the Cave of Machpelah from Ephron in Genesis 23:7-16, for Abraham already knew since the time of visit of the three angels in Genesis 18 that the cave was a holy place. This is one of the few sources that locates the Garden of Eden in the Holy Land. Of course, those creating this legend were already familiar with the tradition that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives, Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah, were buried in that cave in Hebron. (Rachel has a separate grave.) By adding Adam and Eve to those already believed to be buried there, the cave was made even holier, and all of the key fathers and mothers were understood to be buried in the same place. Another myth links Adam and Eve to a cave that came to serve as their burial place. See Apocalypse of Moses 29:3-6, where Adam begs to take incense from the Garden of Eden with him when he is expelled. Adam is said to have hidden that incense in a cave. Indeed, this myth is a close variant of the present myth, where Abraham finds Adam and Eve lying on couches, with candles burning at their head and feet, in the Cave of Machpelah. There is a collection of ancient texts primarily linked to Genesis known as The Cave of Treasures, referring to the cave in which Adam was said to have hid the incense and later to have been buried there.",

      "content": "When the time came for Abraham to take leave of this world, God sent Isaac a dream. In the third hour of the night Isaac woke up, got up from his bed, and ran to the room where his mother and father were asleep. When Isaac reached the door, he cried out, \"Father, open the door so that I may come in.\" Abraham arose and opened the door, and Isaac entered and embraced him, crying loudly. And Abraham said, \"Come here, son. Tell me the truth. What did you see that caused you to run to us in this way?\" Isaac said, \"This night. Father, I saw in a dream the sun and moon above my head. They surrounded me with their rays and illuminated me. And while I rejoiced in their presence, I saw the heavens open and I saw a luminous man descending from heaven, shining more than seven suns. This man came and took the sun from my head and went back into the heavens. Then I was very sad, because he took the sun from me. \"A little later, while I was still mourning, he returned and took the moon from me, from above my head. I wept greatly and begged the Light-Man, saying \"Have mercy on me. Take not my glory from me. If you take the sun from me, at least leave me the moon.\" The Light-Man answered, \"The King on high has sent me to bring them there.\" And he took them from me, but he left the rays that shone upon me. Then Abraham said, \"The Lord has sent an angel of God to take my soul.\"",
      "commentary": "Here God sends Isaac a dream to warn him that the time has come for his father, Abraham, to die. In the dream Abraham and Sarah are identified as the sun and moon that are taken from above Isaac's head. This identification of the father and mother as the sun and moon is found in Joseph's dream in Genesis 37:9-10: And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, \" Behold I have dreamed yet a dream: and behold, the sun and moon and eleven stars bowed down to me . \" And he told it to his father, and to his brothers, and his father rebuked him and said, \" What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down to you to the earth?\" Note that the meaning of the symbols of the sun and moon (and stars) is immediately understood by Jacob. Likewise, Abraham immediately understands the meaning of Isaac's dream, and identifies the figure of the Light-Man with an angel who has been sent by God to take his life. Although Isaac loses the sun and moon in the dream, it is interesting to note that after his plea to the Light-Man, the light that they cast on him remains behind. This light represents the glory they left behind in the form of Abraham's covenant with God. The figure of the Light-Man is found in Gnostic texts. Here the Light-Man is said to have existed even before the demiurge. The Light-Man is closely identified with a Gnostic angel known as the Light-Adam in On the Origins of the World 108:2ff. This myth of the descent of the Light-Man is found in The Testament of Abraham , a pseudepigraphal text of Jewish origins that recounts Abraham's resistance to leaving this world with the Angel of Death. Similar resistance is found in midrashic legends about Moses. Thus both of these patriarchal figures receive special attention from God when the time comes for them to take leave of this world, and both of them put up considerable resistance, so great is their passion to remain alive.",

But do not terrify him; instead, take him with soft speech. So Death put on a radiant robe and assumed the form of an archangel and went to Abraham. Abraham sat at the entrance of his tent in Mamre when a sweet odor came to him, and Abraham saw Death coming toward him in great glory. So Abraham arose and went to meet him, and Death knelt before him and said, \"Most righteous Abraham, I am the bitter cup of death.\" Abraham said, \"No, you have the glory and beauty of an angel.\" Death said, \"I am telling you the truth.\" Abraham said, \"Why have you come here?\" Death answered, \"I have come for your holy soul.\" But Abraham refused to go with him, and arose and went into his house. Death followed him there, and went with him wherever he went in the house. Death said, \"I will not depart until I take your spirit.\" Then Abraham said, \"I beg you, heed me and show me your ferocity.\" But Death said, \"You could not bear to behold it, righteous Abraham.\" Abraham said, \"Yes, I can, because the power of God is with me.\" Then Death put off the bloom of youth and beauty and put on his robe of tyranny, and made his appearance gloomy and ferocious. He showed Abraham seven fiery heads of dragons and other faces, most horrible, each one fiercer than the other, including the face of a lion, the face of a homed serpent, and that of a cobra. And after he saw these things, Abraham said, \"I beg you. Death, hide your ferocity and put on the form of youthful beauty that you had before.\" Death hid his ferocious visage at once, and put on his youthful beauty. Then Abraham went to his room and lay down. And Death said to Abraham, \"Come, kiss my right hand, and may life and strength come to you.\" But Death deceived Abraham, for when Abraham kissed his hand, his soul cleaved to Death's hand. At that moment the angel Michael, along with multitudes of angels, carried away Abraham's precious soul in their hands, in divinely woven linen.",

      "content": "A vision came to Abraham on the day of his death. The voice of the Lord came to him and said, \"Open your eyes, and see your reward.\" Then Abraham felt that he was lifted up by the wind, higher and higher, and suddenly he arrived at a place of great light, where gates of precious stones were opened before him, and myriads of angels approached him. They clothed him in eight garments of light, and a thousand fragrant odors came from the Garden of Eden and perfumed his garments. The angels put two crowns of onyx and fine gold on his head, and eight myrtles in his hand, and the world was filled with their odor. Then the angels brought Abraham to a place where rivers flowed with pure water, and roses and myrtles surrounded them, and their fragrance filled him with infinite delight. He came to a wonderful canopy that had been prepared for him, with four rivers flowing in front of it of honey, wine, oil, and balsam. Above the canopy there were golden vines and pearls shining like stars. At that instant Abraham was suddenly transformed into a happy child, and he saw a great many happy children coming toward him. Abraham played with them and ran with them to hear the wonderful songs of the angels. They walked among sweet-smelling trees and rested under the Tree of Life. Then childhood passed and youth began. The children vanished, and Abraham enjoyed the companionship of handsome young men, and they walked through the length and breadth of the garden. His soul was satisfied with unbounded delight. Then youth passed and old age came, and dignified old men spoke with him about the life of man and the ways of God. They led Abraham to his two canopies, one made of the light of the sun and one of the light of the moon. Abraham saw that there was a partition of lightning between them. He passed through the partition and beheld three hundred and ten marvelous worlds. Then the voice of the Lord came to Abraham, saying, \"What you see now is but the fringe of Paradise; you cannot see the whole of it except with the eyes of God.\" And Abraham said, \"O Lord, take my soul to rest.\" And God took the soul of Abraham to heaven Himself, and so Abraham's life on earth came to an end. Before dying, God sends Abraham a wonderful vision of the reward awaiting him in the Garden of Eden. In the course of this vision he relives his life, from childhood to old age. Finally Abraham leams that all the wonders he has seen and experienced — with considerable emphasis on the visual and sensual delights — are but the fringes of Paradise. God makes the interesting observation that the whole can only be seen with the eyes of God. (See \"The Eyes of God,\" p. 21.) Thus reassured, Abraham requests that God take his soul, and thus dies peacefully. Abraham's ascent into Paradise is similar to those of Adam in Vita Adae et Evae and those of Enoch in the Books of Enoch. Moses also ascended on high, as did the four sages who entered Paradise. See \"The Ascent of Moses,\" p. 171 and \"The Four Who Entered Paradise,\" p. 173.",
      "commentary": "This account is in stark contrast to many of the traditions about the death of Moses, who is said to have fiercely resisted the Angel of Death. But in the end, as with Abraham, it is God Himself who takes his soul.",

      "content": "There are those who insist that Abraham never died, and that he continues to wander the world. There are many reports of those who have seen him. One story tells of a mysterious Tenth Man. For many years only a few Jews were permitted by the Muslim authorities to live in Hebron, where the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives are buried. Once there were so few that on the eve of Yom Kippur, only nine Jews had gathered in the House of Prayer in the city of Hebron, and there was no one else they could call on to complete the minyan. The sun was setting, but they could not begin Kol Nidrei. Just then there was a knock on the door, and when the gabbai answered it, he found an old Jew standing there, a stranger with a long white beard, wearing a white robe, carrying a white tallit. The gabbai gladly invited him in and asked to know his name. The old man said it was Abraham. Then, since the tenth man had arrived, they began the prayers, and the old man joined in with them. The old man remained there with them, praying all night and the next day, until Yom Kippur had come to an end. Never before had they prayed for so long without stopping, but somehow not one of them felt fired, nor did hunger pangs trouble them. All were aware that the power of the Divine Presence filled the House of Prayer. When the Day of Atonement had ended, the old man took his leave, but he left his tallit behind. The gabbai hurried after him to return it, but he was nowhere to be found. That night the gabbai had a dream in which the old man returned to him and revealed that he was actually the patriarch Abraham. So too did he reveal that he had left the tallit behind for him and that it was sacred. For if he wore it when he prayed, he would be permitted a vision of the Divine Presence. The gabbai told the others his dream, and they were filled with wonder to learn the true identity of the old man. The gabbai put on the tallit of Abraham when he prayed that day. And during the silent prayer, when he closed his eyes for an instant, he saw a vision of the Divine Presence glowing in the dark. Afterward, whenever he closed his eyes, the vision would return, as if it were imprinted there. As for the tallit, it is said that Abraham returned to the gabbai in a dream shortly before he died, and told him to request that he be buried in it. This was done, and no sooner did they cover his body with that prayer shawl than his soul found itself in Paradise, inside the synagogue of Abraham the patriarch. There he was made gabbai in that heavenly House of Prayer, where he serves the patriarch Abraham to this day, still wrapped in that sacred tallit. There is an extensive tradition attributing immortality to the key patriarchal figures. Not only is Abraham portrayed as never having died, but there are also accounts about Jacob, Moses, and King David still being alive. Some of these are found in rabbinic sources, and others in Jewish folklore, some of it still recounted orally by the",

      "content": "Isaac pleaded with the Lord on behalf of his wife, because she was barren; and the Lord responded to his plea, and his wife Rebecca conceived. But the children struggled in her womb, and she said, \"If so, why do I exist?\" She went to inquire of the Lord, and the Lord answered her, \"Two nations are in your womb, two separate peoples shall issue from your body; one people shall be mightier than the other, and the older shall serve the younger.\" When her time to give birth was at hand, there were twins in her womb. The first one emerged red all over; so they named him Esau. Then his brother emerged, holding on to the heel of Esau; so they named him Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when they were bom. The rabbis were well aware that the portrayal of Jacob in Genesis revealed many negative qualities about him. They were loath to accept this portrayal, because Jacob was an important patriarch, and especially because his name became Israel, from which the nation of Israel took its name. Therefore there is an intensive whitewashing process found in the rabbinic texts. Some midrashim attribute intention to the unborn twins, Jacob and Esau, and shows that their conflict started in the womb. Genesis Kabbah 63:6 describes how when Rebecca stood near a synagogue, Jacob struggled to come out. When she passed idolatrous temples, Esau struggled to come out. Rebecca went to the academy of Shem and Eber, and they explained that \"There are two nations in your womb. At their birth they will be separated. One will enjoy the pleasures of this world, and the other the delights of the world to come/' Another midrash asserts that Jacob was destined to be bom first, but Esau refused to accept this, and therefore Jacob held back in order not to harm his mother, Rebecca, but that he held on to Esau's heel as a sign that it was he who was really supposed to have been the eldest. This view thus justifies Jacob's forcing Esau to sell his birthright to him, and Jacob's later stealing his brother's blessing, and therefore goes a long way toward mitigating the acts that otherwise identify Jacob as one who tricked and cheated his father and his brother (Midrash ha-Gadol 1:390-391).",

      "commentary": "This legend from Targum Pseudo-Yonathan adds an important detail to Genesis 25:2123, where Isaac prays that Rebecca should conceive. It identifies the place of his prayer as Mount Moriah. On the one hand, this is strange, since Isaac's experience there was so traumatic. On the other hand, Isaac was well aware that it was a holy place, where he could communicate with God. See \"The Births of Jacob and Esau,\" p. 349.",

      "content": "When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the outdoors; but Jacob was a mild man who stayed in camp. Isaac favored Esau because he had a taste for game; but Rebecca favored Jacob. Once when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the open, famished. And Esau said to Jacob, 'Give me some of that red stuff to gulp down, for I am famished\"— which is why he was named Edom. Jacob said, \"First sell me your birthright. And Esau said, \"I am at the point of death, so of what use is my birthright to me?\" But Jacob said, \"Swear to me first.\" So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob. Jacob then gave Esau bread and lentil stew; he ate and drank, and he rose and went away. Thus did Esau spurn the birthright. This famous episode from Genesis clearly establishes the pattern between Jacob and Esau, in which Jacob plays an underhanded role in forcing his brother to sell his birthright for a bowl of lentils. It is hard, if not impossible, to justify Jacob's behavior, although the midrashic texts try to do this by asserting that Jacob was destined to be bom first, but he and Esau struggled in the womb, and Jacob permitted Esau to go first so as not to harm their mother, Rebecca {Genesis Rabbah 67:6). The idea of selling something of value for something worthless has become an aphorism about selling something of value for a bowl of pottage.",

      "content": "Lentils are the food of mourning and sorrow. When Cain killed Abel, Adam and Eve ate lentils as a sign of their mourning over him. And when Haran was burned in Nimrod's furnace, his parents ate lentils as a sign of mourning. And when his grandfather, Abra ham ^ died, Jacob boiled dishes of lentils as a sign of mourning and sorrow, and as a sign that it was a house of mourning. Then he went to comfort his father, Isaac. The lentils were a sign of mourning, but Esau was unconcerned about the death of his grandfather; nothing mattered but satisfying his hunger. This proves that he not only gave up his birthright, he rejected belief in the resurrection of the dead as well. Therefore he was undeserving of his birthright. How do we know that God agreed with this? Because it says. Thus says Yahweh: \"Israel is My first-bom son\" (Exod. 4:22). Then Gabriel and Michael recorded that the birthright belonged to Jacob. And since the birthright was his, so too was the Blessing of the Firstborn, which belonged to the one who possessed the birthright. This midrash is part of an extensive reinterpretation of Jacob's acts in order to justify everything he did, since he, more than any other patriarch, is identified with the nation of Israel. That is because Jacob's name is changed to Israel in Genesis 32:29, after he wrestles with the angel. Here, to justify Jacob's behavior in requiring his brother to pay with his birthright for a dish of lentils, B. Bava Batra 16b suggests that Abraham, the grandfather of Jacob and Esau, had died that day, and that Jacob had prepared the dish to comfort his father, Isaac. Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 35 states that, \"Lentils are the food of mourning and sorrow.\" Thus their preparation would indicate a house of mourning. Targum Pseudo-Yonathan on Genesis 25:29 inserts into the biblical text: \"The day Abraham died, Jacob boiled dishes of lentils and went to comfort his father.\" This traditional sign of mourning is also linked to Adam and Eve and to the death of Haran, suggesting that it was an old and widely known custom, and therefore Esau should have immediately asked if anyone had died. Because he did not, he proved himself to be unworthy of his birthright and the Blessing of the Firstborn.",

Take your gear, your quiver and bow, and go out into the open and hunt me some game. Then prepare a dish for me such as I like, and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my innermost blessing before I die.\" Rebecca had been listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau had gone out into the open to hunt game to bring home, Rebecca said to her son Jacob, \"I overheard your father speaking to your brother Esau, saying, 'Bring me some game and prepare a dish for me to eat, that I may bless you, with the Lord's approval, before I die/ Now, my son, listen carefully as I instruct you. Go to the flock and fetch me two choice kids, and I will make of them a dish for your father, such as he likes. Then take it to your father to eat, in order that he may bless you before he dies.\" Jacob answered his mother Rebecca, \"But my brother Esau is a hairy man and I am smooth skinned. If my father touches me, I shall appear to him as a trickster and bring upon myself a curse, not a blessing.\" But his mother said to him, \"Your curse, my son, be upon me! Just do as I say and go fetch them for me.\" He got them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared a dish such as his father liked. Rebecca then took the best clothes of her older son Esau, which were there in the house, and had her younger son Jacob put them on; and she covered his hands and the hairless part of his neck with the skins of the kids. Then she put in the hands of her son Jacob the dish and the bread that she had prepared. He went to his father and said, \"Father.\" And he said, \"Yes, which of my sons are you?\" Jacob said to his father, \"I am Esau, your firstborn; I have done as you told me. Pray sit up and eat of my game, that you may give me your innermost blessing.\" Isaac said to his son, \"How did you succeed so quickly, my son?\" And he said, \"Because the Lord your God granted me good fortune. Isaac said to Jacob, \"Come closer that I may feel you, my son— whether you are really my son Esau or not.\" So Jacob drew close to his father Isaac, who felt him and wondered. \"The voice is the voice of Jacob, yet the hands are the hands of Esau. He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; and so he blessed him. He asked, \"Are you really my son Esau?\" And when he said, \"I am,\" he said, \"Serve me and let me eat of my son's game that I may give you my innermost blessing.\" So he served him and he ate, and he brought him wine and he drank. Then his father Isaac said to him, \"Come close and kiss me, my son;\" and he went up and kissed him. And he smelled his clothes and he blessed him, saying, \"Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of the fields that the Lord has blessed. May God give you of the dew of heaven and the fat of the earth, abundance of new grain and wine. Let peoples serve you, and nations bow to you; be master over your brothers, and let your mother's sons bow to you. Cursed be they who curse you, blessed they who bless you.\" No sooner had Jacob left the presence of his father Isaac— after Isaac had finished blessing Jacob than his brother Esau came back from his hunt. He too prepared a dish and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, \"Let my father sit up and eat of his son's game, so that you may give me your innermost blessing.\" His father Isaac said to him. Who are you? ' And he said, \"I am your son, Esau, your first-born!\" Isaac was seized with very violent trembling. \"Who was it then,\" he demanded, \"that hunted game and brought it to me? Moreover, I ate of it before you came, and I blessed him; now he must remain blessed!\" When Esau heard his father's words, he burst into wild and bitter sobbing, and said to his father, \"Bless me too. Father!\" But he answered, \"Your brother came with guile and took away your blessing.\" Esau said, \"Was he, then, named Jacob that he might supplant me these two times? First he took away my birthright and now he has taken away my blessing!\" And he added, \"Have you not reserved a blessing for me?\" Isaac answered, saying to Esau, \"But I have made him master over you: I have given him all his brothers for servants, and sustained him with grain and wine. What, then, can I still do for you, my son?\" And Esau said to his father, \"Have you but one blessing. Father? Bless me too. Father!\" And Esau wept aloud. And his father Isaac answered, saying to him, \"See, your abode shall enjoy the fat of the earth and the dew of heaven above. Yet by your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother; but when you grow restive, you shall break his yoke from your neck.\" Now Esau harbored a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing that his father had given him, and Esau said to himself, \"Let but the mourning period of my father come, and I will kill my brother Jacob.\" When the words of her older son Esau were reported to Rebecca, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, \"Your brother Esau is consoling himself by planning to kill you. Now, my son, listen to me. Flee at once to Haran, to my brother Laban. Stay with him a while, until your brother's fury subsides— until your brother's anger against you subsides— and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will fetch you from there. Let me not lose you both in one day!\" Before his death, Isaac calls in Esau to give him the Blessing of the Firstborn, which entitles him to virtually all of his father's property under the rights of primogeniture. Nevertheless, there are many cases in the Bible in which the firstborn did not receive a preferential share. These include Ishmael and Isaac, Esau and Jacob, Reuben and Joseph, and Joseph s sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. A modified version of the rights of primogeniture is given in Deuteronomy 21:15-17, which establishes that a man's property is inherited by his sons, the firstborn receiving a double share.",

That is why it is said.

Here, rather than leaving Isaac's tent like a thief, Jacob is described as going forth crowned like a bridegroom. This is part of the process by which all of Jacob's actions are whitewashed, while everything that Esau does is painted black. For example, Targum Pseudo-Yonathan on Genesis 25:29 states that \"Esau came from the country, and he was exhausted because he had committed five transgressions that day: he had practiced idolatry; he had shed innocent blood; he had lain with a betrothed maiden; he had denied the life of the world to come; and he had despised his birthright.\" For some of the radical interpretations of the Jacob myth, see \"Jacob the Angel,\" p. 364, and \"Jacob the Divine,\" p. 366.",

      "title": "Rachel And The Stolen Idols",
      "content": "Rachel stole the idols of her father, Laban, as it is said, Rachel, meanwhile, had taken the idols (Gen. 31:34). But why did she take them? Some say that she didn't want her father to worship idols. But if so, why did she take them with her, and not bury them on the way, rather than hiding them in her saddlebags? Others say that Rachel stole the Terafim because she knew that Laban was a great sorcerer who practiced all kinds of magical arts, and that he knew how to compel the Terafim to reveal Jacob s whereabouts to Laban. How could they do that? Because they were not idols of clay or stone, but speaking heads that could be made to reveal secrets, as it is said. For the Terafim spoke delusion (Zech. 10:2). Rachel knew that Laban would force the Terafim to reveal the direction Jacob had taken. Thus, since Rachel knew the powers of the Terafim and the dangers they posed, she took them with her, so Laban would not be able to use the Terafim against them. How were the Terafim made? They would slay a firstborn, cut off his head, remove the hair, and sprinkle it with salt and spices. Then they would write magical formulas and names of unclean spirits on a golden tablet and put it under his tongue. They would set it up on the wall, and at certain times of the day the Terafim would absorb celestial influences. Then, when they wanted to divine, they would light candles, and bow down in front of it. Then when the head was questioned, it would be forced to respond to any questions asked of it. And it was to these idols that Laban bowed down. As for those who made the Terafim, as well as those who used them, every one was sent down to Gehenna to be punished. Laban was distraught because his Terafim, whom he called his \"gods\"— (Why did you steal my gods? (Gen. 31:30), were taken when Jacob and his family took flight. The Torah states quite explicitly that it was Rachel who took them: Rachel, meanwhile, had taken the idols (Gen. 31:34). Rachel's actions in this case perplexed the commentators. They didn't want to consider that she stole them because she was attached to them, or because she believed that the one who possessed them had the power of the gods at his command. This dilemma gave birth to one of the strangest midrashim, which asserts that the Terafim actually were speaking heads. Drawing a hint from the verse For the Terafim spoke delusion (Zech. 10:2), this midrash presumes that the Terafim could speak. This leads to a barbaric description of how the heads were obtained, found in Midrash Tanhuma-Yelammedenu, Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer, and other sources, in which a firstborn son was sacrificed and his head cut off. After it had been shrunken with salt and oil, an amulet bearing the name of an evil spirit was placed beneath the tongue. As a result, whenever people invoked that evil spirit, they could force these heads to speak and to reveal everything they wanted to know. In this way Rachel's incriminating actions are fully explained: she was simply trying to prevent the Terafim from assisting her father in finding Jacob and his family. Ibn Ezra indicates the controversy about the very meaning of the term Terafim: \"Some say that the Terafim are copper objects used to tell time. Others say that astrologers have the power to make an image that speaks at certain times.\" Ibn Ezra also gives an explanation for Rachel's taking the Terafim that links them to astrology, while identifying Laban as an astrologer: \"The most likely reason that Rachel stole the Terafim was that Laban, her father, was an astrologer, and Rachel feared that he would look at the stars and discover which way they fled.\" This suggests that the Terafim drew their power from the stars and revealed hidden things to Laban. Note that there is a shift from the identification of the Terafim as wooden or stone idols that would be the objects of worship, to speaking heads whose primary purpose is to divine. This change alleviates the suspicion that Rachel took the Terafim in order to worship them. But it also seems to contradict Laban's assertion that the Terafim were his \"gods.\" MYTHS OF JA&lt;OB 355 The barbaric custom described here seems completely outside of Jewish tradition. It not only involves ritual murder of a firstborn son, but knowledge of techniques that one would associate with cannibals. The primary point of the account of the binding of Isaac in Genesis 22 is that there would be no more ritual sacrifice of children. Thus the clear indication is that the creation of the Terafim was not a Jewish practice. Nor, for that matter, was Laban Jewish. It is hard to find a similarly barbaric example in Jewish myth except for the Yemenite folktale that Adam and Eve devoured the son of Samael. See \"How Samael Entered the Heart of Man,\" p. 454. Joseph Dan links this ingenious explanation of why Rachel stole the idols with a nineteenth-century folktale. See \"Terafim: From Popular Belief to a Folktale.\" This is a story about a boy kidnapped by a demon disguised as a wealthy merchant so that his head could be cut off and serve as one of these Terafim. Apparently Terafim only last for 80 years, and then must be replaced. The story describes the boy's escape from the castle of demons with the crucial aid of the speaking head he finds there and takes with him. Thus he behaves as does Rachel, and for the same reason — because the Terafim could be forced to speak. See \"The Speaking Head\" in Lilith's Cave , pp. 148-159. Rabbinic commentary links Jacob's vow to Laban, \" But anyone with whom you find your gods shall not remain alive!\" (Gen. 31:32) with the premature death of Rachel. In his Torah commentary. Rabbi Bachya ben Asher (1260-1340) says, \"This curse resulted in Rachel's dying on the journey.\" Of course, there is nothing in the text to indicate that Jacob had any idea Rachel had taken the Terafim. But many midrashim suggest that Jacob's words turned into a dreadful curse that may have inadvertently brought about Rachel's early death, and prevented her from being buried in the Cave of Machpelah.",

      "content": "Jacob left Beersheva and went to Haran. On the way to Haran, he met the place (Gen 28:11). What does this mean? That Jacob did indeed go all the way to Haran. Then he remembered that he had passed the place where his father and grandfather had prayed, and he had failed to stop. He said to himself, \"Is it possible that I passed by the place where my forefathers prayed and I did not pray?\" Just as his forefathers prayed for the building of Jerusalem and the holy Temple, and their prayers were answered during the time of the two Temples, so too did Jacob want to pray for the future rebuilding of Jerusalem and the Temple. At that moment a miracle occurred, and he immediately arrived at that place, the site where, in the future, the Temple would one day be built. There Jacob prayed as never before. And when he finished praying, the sun, which was high in the sky, set two hours before its time. That is why Jacob decided to sleep there, for it had already grown dark. And as he lay down, God folded up the whole of the Land of Israel and placed it beneath Jacob, and that is the meaning of the verse \"The ground on which you are lying I will assign to you and to your offspring \" (Gen. 28:13). And that night Jacob dreamed of the ladder reaching from earth to heaven, with angels ascending and descending on it. And when he awoke he understood that it was indeed a holy place, the very gate of heaven. This midrash responds to the strange language of he met the place (Gen. 28:11) by suggesting that a miracle occurred, and he was transported to that place, which is identified as the same spot where Abraham and Isaac had prayed. So too does the sun set before its time. This second miracle, of the sun setting prematurely, is parallel to the stopping of the sun in the Book of Joshua: And the sun stood still, and the moon halted (Josh. 10.13). The place where Jacob s dream takes place is identified by the rabbis as Mount Moriah, where the future Temple would be built. Genesis Rabbah quotes God as saying to Jacob: \"On your departure I caused the orb of the sun to set for you, and on your return I restored to you the hours you lost.\" This is an example of how anything is possible for God, even changing the natural order that He Himself had created.",

      "content": "Jacob was traveling alone from Beersheva to Haran. Along the way, he met the place (Gen. 28:11). Why did Jacob choose to stop there? Some say that Jacob had a vision when he reached that place of the Holy Temple being built, destroyed, and then restored to its full perfection. Others say that he saw two Jerusalems, one of earth and one of heaven. Still others say that as he approached, he saw the Shekhinah hovering over that place, in the site where the future Temple would be built. Then there are those who say that when Jacob reached that place, the world became like a wall before him, and he had no choice but to stop. Jacob's comments about the place where he had his dream of the heavenly ladder demonstrate that it was inherently sacred: \"How full of awe is this place. This is none other than the abode of God and that is the gateway of heaven\" (Gen. 28:17). These myths attempt to offer a reason for Jacob deciding to stop there. Three of these suggest that Jacob had a vision linked with the Temple that would be built in Jerusalem. In the rabbinic view, Jacob's vision took place on Mount Moriah, just as did Abraham's sacrifice of the ram caught in the thorns, and Mount Moriah was identical, in this mythic view, with the place of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. The fourth interpretation, from Genesis Rabbah , states that Jacob could not go on, for \"the world became like a wall before him.\" Here God is portrayed as leaving Jacob no choice but to stop there, much as, in one myth, God compels Israel to accept the Torah by holding Mount Sinai over their heads (B. Shab. 88a). See \"God Offers the Torah to Israel,\" p. 264. Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 21:5 explains that God envisioned the Temple built, destroyed, and rebuilt from the very beginning. It links Genesis 1:1 to the building of the Temple, Genesis 1:2 to the destruction of the Temple, and Genesis 1:3 to the rebuilding of the Temple at the End of Days.",

      "content": "In his dream, Jacob not only saw the ladder and the angels, but when he peered up to the top of the ladder he saw the face of a man, carved out of fire, peering down at him. So too did Jacob see God fashioning the heavenly Temple with His own hands out of jewels and pearls and the radiance of the Shekhinah. And when he saw that glorious Temple taking form on high, Jacob understood that it was the House of God that would sustain Israel forever, until the end of all generations. And he also understood that just as God was fashioning a Temple in heaven, so too would He build one in the same way on earth, as it is said. The sanctuary, O Yahweh, which Your hands established (Exod. 15:17). Then Jacob peered into the highest heaven and saw God's throne. He saw that there wasa face carved into the throne, and the face that Jacob saw there was his own Then God called out to him, saying \"Jacob, Jacob!\" And Jacob replied, \"Here I am. Lord \" And God revealed his covenant to Jacob, as he had to Abraham and Isaac before him. 77ie Ladder of Jacob expands the details of Jacob's dream (Gen. 28:10-19), adding that \"there were twelve steps leading to the top of the ladder, and on each step to the top there were two human faces, on the right and on the left, twenty-four faces .... And God was standing above its highest face, and He called to me from there, saying Jacob Jacob'\" (The Ladder of Jacob 1:5, 1:8). The key image is that of the fiery face at the top of the ladder: And the top of the ladder was the face as of a man, carved out of fire\" (1:45). Although the face is not identified, there is a strong implication it is that of God. One motivation for Jacob's vision of God at the top of the ladder in The Ladder of Jacob may have been a response to the biblical verse And the Lord was standing beside him (Gen. 28:13). God is rarely found standing on the earth, and The Ladder of Jacob puts God back m heaven, which is considered more appropriate. The tradition that God showed the heavenly and earthly Temple to Jacob (and the other patriarchs) is very old. Sifre on Deuteronomy 352 says of the Temple, \"Jacob saw it built, destroyed, and rebuilt.\" This is derived from Genesis 28:17: Shaken, he said, \"How awe-inspmng is this place!\" This is none other than the abode of God, and that is the gateway to heaven. The rabbis interpret: This is none indicates that the Temple was destroyedother than the abode of God and that is the gateway to heaven shows that he saw it rebuilt in the future. Midrash Tanhuma, va-Yetze 9 states that \"the prophets also saw it built, destroyed, and rebuilt.\" Here God is quoted as saying: \"You have seen it destroyed in this world, but in the World to Come I am rebuilding it Myself. I burned it, and I shall rebuild it.\" Other sources indicate that God showed other visions to Jacob in his dream According to Midrash Tanhuma-Yelammedenu, va-Yetze 2, God showed Jacob the guardian angels of Babylon, Media, Greece, and Edom, all ascending and descending.",

So Jacob named the place Penuel, meaning, \"I have seen a divine being face to face, yet my life has been preserved.\" The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping on his hip. That is why the children of Israel to this day do not eat the thigh muscle that is on the socket of the hip, since Jacob's hip socket was wrenched at the thigh muscle.",
      "commentary": "This is one of the most important and mysterious episodes in the Torah. Here Jacob, exhausted from his escape from Laban and facing a small army led by his brother Esau, remains alone on one side of the river Yabbok and wrestles with an ish all night. Ish means \"man,\" but all of the interpretations of this passage assume that Jacob wrestled with an angel or possibly even with God. The question is — which angel? There are many theories. Some assume it is Samael, who is identified as Esau's guardian angel. Samael is another name for Satan, and suggesting that he was Esau's guardian angel is a way of labeling Esau as evil. This interpretation assumes that Samael's goal was to wear Jacob out, so that Esau could easily defeat him the next day. Other interpretations identify the angel as Michael or Uriel. One of the most fascinating explanations is that Jacob himself was an angel, and the angel Uriel was sent to tell him it was time to return to heaven. See \"Jacob the Angel,\" p. 364. The suggestion that Jacob wrestled with God comes from the angel's statement to Jacob that You have striven with beings divine and human and have prevailed (Gen. 32:29). Elohim, translated here as \"divine beings,\" normally means \"God.\" Jacob receives a new name, Israel, from the angel, and after this his behavior changes. He makes peace with Esau and takes on the role of a patriarch. Note that in Hebrew the name is Yisrael, which can be translated as \"One who has wrestled with God.\" Because Jacob's name and the name of the people of Israel is the same, there is a strong identification between Jacob and the nation of Israel. One result of this strong identification is that a great effort is made in the rabbinic texts to justify all of Jacob's actions, including the bartered birthright and the stolen blessing. Another result is that some came to regard Jacob as a divine figure. See \"Jacob the Divine,\" p. 366. The entire cycle of Jacob myths is certainly one of the most compelling in all of Jewish tradition.",

      "content": "The angel that wrestled with Jacob was none other than Esau's guardian angel, and that angel was none other than Samael. By making Jacob expend great effort all night, Samael hoped to weaken him, so that Esau might defeat Jacob the next day. But Samael did not prevail over Jacob, and before he let the angel take its leave, Jacob insisted that the angel bless him. And he said, \"Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed\" (Gen. 32:29). Why did Jacob seek the angel's blessings? The truth is that he was not demanding that blessing for himself, but for his descendants, the people of Israel. It meant that Samael could not protest whenever God decided to liberate Israel in times of danger. For the blessing was not for Jacob, but for Israel, and that blessing made the Exodus possible. This ingenious commentary by Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira, the Rebbe of the Warsaw Ghetto, builds on the midrashic interpretation that the angel with whom Jacob wrestled was Esau s guardian angel, none other than the evil angel Samael. He combines this explanation with the midrashic view that everything said about Jacob applied to the people of Israel, since Jacob became Israel. So here the angel's forced blessing is said to have been intended not for Jacob, but for Israel, Jacob's descendants, and it saved them during times of great danger and even made the Exodus possible. In the following myth, \"The Magic Flock,\" the angel Jacob wrestles with is also identified as Esau's guardian angel and as Samael.",

He himself wished to remain alone there, to rest from his escape from Laban, and to prepare himself for his encounter with Esau the next day. Soon after everyone else had crossed the river, a shepherd arrived there with his flocks. He proposed to Jacob that they help each other in crossing their flocks, and Jacob agreed. They started with Jacob s flock, and in a twinkling the shepherd succeeded in transferring all of them to the other side. Then they turned to the shepherd's flock, and Jacob assisted him by carrying the animals two by two across the river. Jacob worked without pausing, but after he had forded the river with a great many animals, he saw that the flocks of the shepherd had not grown smaller but seemed to have increased. Still Jacob continued to bear the flocks across the river hour after hour. But as the day began to grow dark, he saw that the flocks of the shepherd still reached to the horizon, with no end in sight. Then Jacob understood that this was no ordinary shepherd, but MYTHS OF JA&lt;OB 361 some kind of magician, and that all the flocks he had carried were only an illusion. In his fury Jacob accused the shepherd of enchantment and deceit. Then the shepherd touched his finger to the earth, and a great fire burst forth. But this display of his power did not frighten Jacob, and the two began to struggle, and they continued to wrestle all night. During their struggle the magician wounded Jacob in his thigh, but Jacob still continued to fight. And as dawn approached, the magician sought to depart, but Jacob refused to let him go. In this way Jacob received his adversary's blessing, and his name was changed from Jacob to Israel.",
      "commentary": "Some say that shepherd was Samael, the guardian angel of Esau, who came to Jacob to weaken him before his encounter with Esau. Others say it was the angel Michael, who had been sent by God to show Jacob that he, like the angels, was made of fire, and that he had nothing to fear from Esau. And, in truth, after this struggle Jacob was a changed man, who put down his weapons and his pride, and bowed seven times to his brother, and Esau ran to meet him and embraced him (Gen. 33:4), and at last they came together in peace. This legend is closely related to the account of Jacob's wrestling with the angel in Genesis 32:25-33. The identity of the sorcerer thus depends on the identity given to the angel, or whoever it was that Jacob wrestled. Most accounts identify this figure as the angel Michael or as the guardian angel of Esau, who, disguised as a shepherd, first got Jacob to agree that they would assist each other in carrying their flocks across the river Yabbok, and then created the illusion of so many flocks, attempting to exhaust Jacob before they wrestled and before Jacob's encounter with Esau the next day. This guardian angel of Esau is most often identified as Samael or as Sar shel Romi, the guardian angel of the Roman Empire, because of the close association between Esau and Rome. This story is of particular importance as it is an early example of an illusion tale, a type of tale that has a distinct and prominent place in Jewish lore. This theme was probably drawn into Jewish lore from oriental sources, where it also was very popular.",

      "title": "Jacob's Ascent On High",
      "content": "It is said that the battle between Jacob and the angel did not take place on the shores of the River Yabbok, but in the palaces of heaven, for Jacob's soul ascended on high and struggled with the angel there. For ever since Jacob's dream of the ladder that reached from earth into heaven, his soul was able to ascend its highest rungs. On the night that his body lay sleeping on the shore of the River Yabbok, Jacob's soul did indeed ascend on high, and there he wrestled until dawn with none other than the angel Michael. Michael, the heavenly priest, led a choir of ministering angels in singing God's praises every morning, and that is why he begged, \" Let me go, for dawn is breaking \" (Gen. 32:27). Just then many bands of ministering angels arrived and said. The time of singing God's praises has come (S. of S. 2:12). Michael pleaded with Jacob, saying, \"Let me go, I beg you, lest the ministering angels incinerate me for delaying the song.\" But Jacob insisted that he would not let him go unless he blessed him, and Michael said. Your name shall no more be called Jacob , but Israel (Gen. 32:29). And he added, \"Blessed are you, bom of woman, for you entered the palace above and remained alive.\" That is when God chose to reveal Himself to Jacob and the angels. Looking up, Jacob saw God face to face. At that instant a change came over him, and he became Jacob the patriarch, father of Israel's twelve tribes. As for the angel Michael, in the presence of God his strength was depleted. Still, he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh and harmed him. But when God saw this. He said: \"What right have you to cripple My priest?\" Michael answered, \"Master of the universe, am I not Your priest?\" God replied: \"You are My priest in the world above; Jacob is My priest in the world below.\" Then Michael summoned Raphael, the Angel of Healing, and begged him to heal Jacob. And as soon as Raphael touched Jacob s thigh, he recovered, and no sign of his injury remained.",
      "commentary": "This is an unusual interpretation of the combat between Jacob and the angel in that, unlike virtually all of the other sources, it suggests that it took place in heaven rather than on earth. During the battle a band of angels appears, who are anxious to have Michael join them to conduct the angelic choir. Finally, God Himself appears to defend Jacob and to accuse Michael of misbehavior for wounding Jacob in the thigh. This version also differs in that it states that Jacob's wound was healed by the angel Raphael, while the biblical text clearly states that he was limping on his hip (Gen. 32:32). One of the halachic requirements to serve as High Priest was to have no physical imperfections. Since Jacob had set up altars and made offerings to God, he had in essence taken on the role of a priest, before the appearance of Aaron, brother of Moses, whom the Bible represents as the first High Priest. According to the Halakhah, Jacob's wound would have made him unable to serve as priest. Thus, in this version of the myth, Jacob is healed, and can thus continue his priestly role. This version does offer a credible reason for Michael's anxiousness — to be set free in order to conduct the heavenly choir. In fact, the angel fears that he will be incinerated by the other angels if he doesn't join the choir at once. The appearance of the angels and finally of God Himself reinforces the heavenly setting, as does Michael's comment to Jacob that \"you entered the palace above and remained alive.\" This mythic version seems to echo the Hekhalot texts describing heavenly journeys into the celestial palaces, which were notoriously dangerous— the angel at the sixth gate would cut off the head of anyone who didn't know the right answer. ( Hekhalot literally means \"palaces,\" referring to the palaces of heaven.) But here Jacob, like Rabbi Akiba in B. Hagigah 14b, survives the dangerous ascent intact. See \"The Four Who Entered Paradise,\" p. 173. God identifies Jacob as His High Priest because of the biblical accounts of Jacob setting up an altar and making an offering to God at Beth El (Gen. 28:18 and 35:6-7) and other sites. Michael is said to serve as the heavenly High Priest, making offerings in the celestial Temple. Their competing roles as High Priest suggest a possible reason for their conflict, although this is never made explicit. Ironically, Michael is also identified in other sources as Jacob's guardian angel, since Michael had been appointed the guardian angel of Israel from the day he visited' Abraham to announce the coming birth of Isaac. Therefore Jacob might be seen as wrestling with his conscience. After all, he has just escaped from the forces of his uncle, Laban, and now he faces the forces of Esau. The bitter harvest he has brought upon himself has become apparent. In several sources the angel is not identified as Michael, but as Metatron, and the identities of the two angels are often switched. For more on the role of Metatron in these Jacob myths see the note to \"Jacob the Angel,\" p. 364.",

      "content": "Jacob possessed three books. One was the Book of Adam, of which it is written. This is the book of the generations of Adam (Gen. 5:1). The second was the Book of Enoch, which recounts how Enoch walked with God ; and then he was no more, for God took him (Gen. 5:24). The third was Abraham's Book of Creation. From a midrashic perspective, Jacob would have been in possession of these three books. The existence of the Book of Adam is derived from the verse This is the book of the generations of Adam (Gen. 5:1). This book is sometimes also identified with the Book of Raziel. For more on the latter, see \"The Book of Raziel,\" p. 252. The Book of Enoch recounts Enoch's heavenly journey, elaborating on the terse account of Enoch found in Genesis 5:21-24. There is also an old tradition that Abraham was author of the Sefer Yetzirah, the Book of Creation, the earliest kabbalistic text. Thus all three of these books were believed to have existed at the time of Jacob and might have been available to him. Jacob's access to these books provides a partial explanation for the level of spiritual achievement attributed to him in midrashic texts. See, for example, \"Jacob the Angel/' p. 364 and \"Jacob the Divine/' p. 366.",

      "content": "Jacob was no ordinary man. If the truth be known, his true name was Israel, and he was an angel of God, the very archangel of the power of the Lord and the first minister before the face of God. Indeed, he was the first living being to whom God gave life, with the beauty of Adam. When the angel Israel descended to earth and became Jacob, he forgot his divine origin. God tried to remind him when He sent him the dream of the ladder reaching from earth to heaven, so that he might glimpse the celestial world he had left behind. In the dream angels of God were ascending and descending on it (Gen. 28:12). For the angels who had accompanied him from his father's house went up to heaven to announce to the angels on high: Come and see Jacob the pious, whose image is fixed upon the Throne of Glory, the one you have longed to see.\" Then the rest of the holy angels of the Lord came down to look at him. That is why the angels went up and down the ladder, for they ascended to see the face carved on the celestial throne, and they descended to see the face of Jacob as he slept, whose features were identical to those carved on high. In the dream Jacob heard the voice of God say, \"You, too, Jacob, climb up the ladder.\" For God was trying to remind Jacob that he was an angel, and that the time had come for him to return to the heavenly realm. But Jacob said, \"Master of the Universe, I am afraid that if I climb up I will have to come down.\" Nor did he ascend on high. Indeed, it is said that if Jacob had climbed up the ladder, he would not have had to come down again, and Israel would have been spared great suffering. Thus when Jacob wrestled with the angel at the River Yabbok, the struggle was not that of a man and angel, but that of two angels— Uriel and Israel. Some say that Uriel had been sent to remind Jacob of his divine origin, saying, \"Know that you were once an angel, who descended to earth and took up dwelling among humans and your name became Jacob. Now your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel\" (Gen. 32:29). Others say that Uriel wrestled with Jacob, saying, \"My name will take precedence over your name and the names of every other angel.\" At first Jacob did not understand, but suddenly he remembered that he once was an angel. And Jacob said, \"Are you not Uriel? Have you forgotten that I am Israel, the chief commander among the heavenly hosts?\" And Jacob called out God's secret Name and thus defeated him. Still others insist that Jacob did not become an angel until after his death; only then did he become an immortal angel. Sometime before or after his death, Jacob himself said, \"For I who speak to you, I Jacob-Israel, am an angel of God and a ruling spirit, the first servant before the presence of God. It was God who gave me the name Israel, which means, 'the man who sees God,' because I am the firstborn of all living beings that God brought to life.\" Of the many theories about the meaning of Jacob's struggle with a mysterious figure at the River Yabbok (Gen. 33:25-31), one of the most interesting is that Jacob was",

      "title": "Jacob Never Died",
      "content": "Everyone thought that Jacob had died. He had given his sons his final blessings, and it appeared that his soul had taken leave of this world. In fact, he was embalmed and buried. But even though it appeared that he had died, Jacob was actually alive. Nor did he die after that. Indeed, Jacob never died. It is said that some of those at Jacob's funeral saw his eyes open once or twice, but they thought their own eyes had deceived them. Indeed, Jacob was present during the Exodus from Egypt, and he witnessed the crossing of the Red Sea and the drowning of Pharaoh's soldiers who chased after them. That is the meaning of the verse Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the shore of the sea (Exod 14:30). Likewise, Jacob witnessed the giving of the Torah, the ascent of Elijah, and Daniel's encounter with Bel. So too did he see the Temple built, destroyed, and rebuilt. Still others say that God's promise to Jacob, I will deliver you from far away ; your folk from their land of captivity (Jer. 30:10), meant that Jacob lives on in his seed, especially in those who make their home in the Holy Land. After all, Jacob was also Israel, and as long as the children of Israel still exist, Jacob will never die. One of the primary mythic motifs in Judaism concerns heroic figures who never die. Elijah's ascent in a fiery chariot (2 Kings 2:11) seems to have set this theme in motion. Others who are portrayed as having never died include Enoch, who walked with God, and he was no more; for God took him (Gen. 5:24). This ambiguous statement, rather than the expected, \"and he died/' gave birth to a rich tradition about Enoch in which he was said to have been taken up into heaven and (in some versions) transformed into the angel Metatron. In addition, Abraham, Moses, and King David are often subjects of rabbinic legends and folktales about appearances after their deaths. Although the deaths of all of them are clearly stated in the Bible, there are also some doubts associated with these accounts. Thus it says about Moses, And no one knows of his burial place to this day (Deut. 34:6). Likewise, there is considerable doubt that King David is buried in his tomb on Mount Zion. The tradition that Jacob never died may derive from the memorable reply that Jacob's sons made to Joseph, when he asked them \" How is your aged father of whom you spoke? Is he still in good health?\" They replied, \"He is yet alive\" (Gen. 43:27-28). This phrase is often quoted as evidence that Jacob never died. Rashi offers another clue for Jacob's immortality in his interpretation of Genesis 49:33, Breathing his last, he was gathered to his people. Rashi comments: \"But 'dying' is not said of him since the word used was ' vayigva / 'expired/ rather than 'vayamot/ 'dying/ Our rabbis of blessed memory said that this implies that 'our father Jacob did not die.'\" Here Rashi quotes B. Ta'anit 5b, where Rabbi Yitzhak says, in the name of Rabbi Yohanan: “Ya’akov Avinu lo met— Our father Jacob did not die.\" Further, Jacob's immortality seems to be understood as linked to the people of Israel thus, as long as the people Israel thrive, Jacob is assured of immortality. This identification of the people Israel with Jacob is made explicit in Jeremiah 30:10: \"Therefore fear not, O Jacob My servant said Yahweh. \" Neither be dismayed, O Israel, For, lo, I will save you from afar\"",

      "title": "Summoning The Patriarchs",
      "content": "During the reign of Emperor Rudolf II, there lived among the Jews of Prague the great Rabbi Judah Loew, who was well versed in all of the mysteries and was a great master of the kabbalah. Now it happened that the emperor heard of Rabbi Loew's reputation and sent for him with a strange request: he wanted the rabbi to invoke the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the sons of Jacob, to summon them from their graves. Rabbi Loew was appalled at this request, but when the emperor threatened the well-being of the Jews of Prague if he did not comply. Rabbi Loew agreed to attempt to do as he had asked. The rabbi warned the emperor, however, that under no circumstances must he laugh at what he saw, and the emperor promised that he would not. So it was that the day and place were fixed, and when Rabbi Loew and the emperor were alone in a secluded room of the castle. Rabbi Loew pronounced the spell that summoned the patriarchs and the sons of Jacob. And to the great amazement of the emperor, they appeared one after the other in their true form, and the emperor was amazed at the size and power of each of them, which far exceeded those of men in his own time. But when Naphtali, the son of Jacob, leaped with great ease over ears of com and stalks of flax in the vision, the emperor could not contain himself and began to laugh. Suddenly the apparitions vanished and the ceiling of that room began to descend and was on the verge of crushing the emperor when Rabbi Loew succeeded in making it halt with the help of smother spell. And it is told that the fallen ceiling can still be seen today in that room, which is kept locked. Numerous tales concerning Rabbi Judah Loew of Prague are to be found. The most famous of these concerns the creation of the golem, the man made out of clay, with which Rabbi Loew was said to have protected the Jewish community of Prague from a series of blood libels. But there are many other tales recounting the marvels of the Maharal, as Rabbi Loew was known. Many of these concern his use of powers deriving from his knowledge of the Jewish mystical tradition, known as kabbalah. Only the purest and most eminent sages were considered capable of engaging in kabbalistic studies, and a great many stories are told of those who lost their sanity or even their lives by undertaking such studies without the proper background or preparation. Here the king is saved from destruction only because the pious Rabbi Loew is able to prevent the ceiling from collapsing. The magic of being able to invoke the presence of the patriarchs reflects the midrashic principle that the past is alive and that all generations exist at the same time. The collapsing of the room in which the vision of the patriarchs takes place echoes the famous talmudic legend of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and other rabbis, who disagreed about a point of the Law. See \"The Rabbis Overrule God,\" p. 67. Another, probably earlier, version of the summoning of a patriarch is found in Ma'aseh Nissim. This describes how Rabbi Lezer, a master of the Name, who lived in Worms, invoked King David's general Joab. Joab turned out to be of such great size that every step he took caused the house to shake and terrified the young men who observed the invocation, so they begged the rabbi to make him disappear, which he did. So frivolous was this use of the Ineffable Name, that in the version recounted in \"Summoning the Patriarchs\" it is the emperor who makes the demand, rather than the young Jewish students.",

But there was a sorcerer, whose name was Pilti, who had read in the Book of Signs. From reading there he had learned of the coming birth of the child Moses, who would set free his people, the Jews, from oppression, while the kingdom of Egypt would suffer. This sorcerer reported to Pharaoh that he had seen the star of Israel ascending, while the destruction of Pharaoh's kingdom was growing near. And when Pharaoh heard this, he grew afraid, and he asked the sorcerer to tell him more of what he had seen. Then Pilti reported that he had seen the Apostle of the Jews cast into the sea, and he had also seen the people Israel cast into the sea, and the waters of the sea were parted by him who had not yet been born. Now when Pharaoh heard this he was filled with anger for forty days, and since the child had not yet been bom, he commanded that the men of Israel be prevented from approaching their wives, lest the child be conceived. Even Amram was forbidden to return to his wife, and was forced to remain within the palace. But Pharaoh could not stand against the will of the Lord. One night a meeting was arranged between Amram and his wife, Jochebed, and from this meeting the child was begotten in the womb of his mother. Then the sorcerer Pilti returned to Pharaoh and told him that he had seen signs that the child had been conceived, despite the command of Pharaoh, for a star had revealed the child's future. Pharaoh grew angry and made a decree that every son bom to the Hebrews should be cast into the Nile, but that every daughter should be permitted to live. However the midwives feared the God of Israel, and secretly let the male children live. Therefore the people multiplied in number, and Pharaoh set himself against the Hebrews, who were growing powerful. Now when the time came for a daughter of Israel to give birth, she would go into the wilderness. If the child was a daughter, she would return with the girl child. But if it were a son, he was left in the wilderness, where God protected him, and suckled him with honey out of the rocks. And when the child had grown, he would return to his father's house. And all of these children had complete faith and trust in God, and never forgot how they were preserved. Then God remembered the covenant He had made with the pious, and in the seventh month the great prophet Moses was bom. And God told the Hosts of Heaven that he had been bom for whose sake God had created the world out of nothingness.",

      "content": "Then Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, \"Every boy that is bom you shall throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.\" A certain man of the house of Levi went and married a Levite woman. The woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw how beautiful he was, she hid him for three months. When she could hide him no longer, she got a wicker basket for him and caulked it with bitumen and pitch. She put the child into it and placed it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile. And his sister stationed herself at a distance, to learn what would befall him. The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe in the Nile, while her maidens walked along the Nile. She spied the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to fetch it. When she opened it, she saw that it was a child, a boy crying. She took pity on it and said, \"This must be a Hebrew child.\" Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, \"Shall I go and get you a Hebrew nurse to suckle the child for you?\" And Pharaoh's daughter answered, \"Yes.\" So the girl went and called the child's mother. And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, \"Take this child and nurse it for me, and I will pay your wages.\" So the woman took the child and nursed it. When the child grew up, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, who made him her son. She named him Moses, explaining, \"I drew him out of the water.\" As Joseph Campbell notes in The Hero with a Thousand Faces , the birth of the hero is inevitably extraordinary. Faced with Pharaoh's decree ordering the death of all male Hebrew infants, Moses' mother placed him in an ark left floating in the bulrushes, well aware that the infant would be found, and hopefully raised, by an Egyptian family. That the one who finds him is the daughter of Pharaoh is an expression of his extraordinary fate. Note that this myth also provides an explanation for Moses' name, relating it to how he was found and drawn out of the water.",

      "content": "After the daughter of Pharaoh found the infant Moses in the bulrushes, she brought the child to live in the palace. There she told her father and his court that the Nile river had given her that child as a gift. So it was that they accepted the child, since it was the wish of the princess. But one of Pharaoh's sorcerers secretly believed that the child was a Hebrew. And he waited for the chance to turn against him. One day, when Moses was three years old, he sat at the table on his mother's lap. Next to her sat Pharaoh, and to his right was Pharaoh's wife. Attracted by the glittering gems in Pharaoh's crown, the child Moses reached for the crown and knocked it off of Pharaoh's head. Then the evil sorcerer, who had been waiting for just such a moment, quickly said: \"Do not ignore this sign from fate, my lord. For this child may be destined to usurp your throne.\" Pharaoh was filled with fear that this might have been such a sign. Therefore he called together all his advisors and asked their opinions. Now the angel Gabriel had been sent by God to guard the infant Moses at all times. And when the angel saw the danger the child faced, he disguised himself in the form of one of Pharaoh's advisers. And when Pharaoh asked them what they should do, he spoke and said: \"Surely the child meant no evil. Why not give him a test to prove this? I suggest that two bowls be brought here. One of them will contain precious jewels and the other burning coals. If the child reaches for the jewels, this shows that he knows the coals are dangerous. For the coals will glow brighter than the jewels. That would prove that he is wise beyond his years. But if he reaches for the coals, that would prove that he has no more understanding than any other infant.\" Pharaoh quickly agreed to this test, for it seemed reasonable to him. And when the bowls had been brought and the infant Moses set down before them, the angel Gabriel made himself invisible and stood next to the child. Now as it happened Moses was attracted to the jewels rather than the burning coals, and would have reached for them. But as he did, the angel stopped his hand and made him reach for the coals instead. And before the child realized how hot the coals were, he had brought one to his tongue, singeing it. And when the child burst into tears. Pharaoh concluded that the child was completely innocent. That is how the child Moses was able to remain within Pharaoh's palace until he was grown. But because he had singed his tongue, he always spoke with a bit of a stutter after that. And that is why he brought his brother, Aaron, to speak for him when the day came that he stood before Pharaoh and demanded that he let his people go.",
      "commentary": "This is an extremely famous midrash that is often told to children. It explains how Moses got his stutter, as well as how Pharaoh decided to keep the infant Moses and raise him in the palace. This is, indeed, an appropriate midrash for children, who can easily understand why the bright jewel would be more attractive to an infant than a burning coal. It is possible that there were specific midrashim that were primarily intended for children. For other examples, see \"The Giant Og,\" p. 461 and the commentary to \"The Star Maiden,\" p. 455 about the angel's wings.",

      "content": "Now Moses, tending the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, drove the flock into the wilderness, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. An angel of the Lord appeared to him in a blazing fire out of a bush. He gazed, and there was a bush all aflame, yet the bush was not consumed. Moses said, \"I must turn aside to look at this marvelous sight; why doesn't the bush bum up?\" When the Lord saw that he had turned aside to look, God called to him out of the bush: \"Moses! Moses!\" He answered, \"Here I am.\" And He said, \"Do not come closer. Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you stand is holy ground. I am,\" He said, \"the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\" And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God. The first encounter Moses has with God has many of the earmarks of a mystical vision. God speaks to Moses out of a bush that is burning but is not consumed. From this time on, the life of Moses is completely transformed, as many mystics have described their lives after having a mystical experience. However, in biblical terms what Moses experiences is not a personal vision, but the arrival of his true destiny, serving as the Redeemer of Israel. It may seem strange that God chose something as unimposing as a bush to reveal Himself, but there are other examples of God contracting Himself into a small space, such as the Ark. Later a kabbalistic principle, that of tzimtzum, would be established on this concept of contraction. See \"The Contraction of God,\" p. 13. As with Abraham, God has chosen Moses, who starts out as a reluctant prophet, but in the end becomes the greatest prophetic figure of all. From this point on, God gives Moses explicit instructions about how to approach Pharaoh to demand that the Israelites, who were valuable slaves, should be set free and permitted to depart from Egypt. Likewise, God instructs Moses in how to approach the people of Israel, who are slow to acknowledge Moses as their leader. In subsequent encounters, Moses speaks directly to God, sees Him face to face, and receives the Torah, God's most precious gift, for Israel. All of these events are prefaced by this first revelation at the burning bush.",

      "title": "Moses Swallowed By A Serpent",
      "content": "At a night encampment on the way , Yahweh encountered Moses and sought to kill him (Exod. 4:24). Why did God seek to kill him? Because of his son, Gershom, who had not been circumcised since Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, had not allowed Moses to circumcise him. Some say that God sent the angel Uriel in the guise of a giant serpent, who came and swallowed Moses from his head to the place of his circumcision. When Zipporah saw this, she understood that Moses had been attacked because their son had not been circumcised. So Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son's foreskin, and touched his legs with it , saying , \"You are truly a bridegroom of blood to me!\" And when He let him alone , she added , \"A bridegroom of blood because of the circumcision\" (Exod. 4:25-26). Others say that God sent two angels, Af and Hemah, the Angels of Anger and Fury, after Moses. Hemah swallowed him, except for his legs. Only after Zipporah circumcised their son did Hemah spit him out. Then Moses sought to slay the destroying angels, as it is said. Give up anger , abandon fury (Ps. 37:8). Still others say that Zipporah knew by divine inspiration that in order to save Moses she must circumcise her son. Then she did not hesitate, but took the flint and cut off her son's foreskin (Exod. 4:25) and cast the foreskin at the feet of the Destroyer, saying, \"May the blood of this circumcision atone for my husband.\" After that the Destroyer left him alone. Then Zipporah said, \"How beloved is the blood that has delivered this bridegroom from the hand of the Angel of Death.\" The account of how God sought to kill Moses in Exodus 4:24 has always been considered perplexing. Many biblical scholars believe the passage is fragmentary. Especially oblique are Zipporah's comments about Moses being \"a bridegroom of blood\" to her. The rabbinic explanation is that Moses had not circumcised his son Gershom at the proper time and therefore God sent an angel in the form of a serpent who swallowed Moses from his head to the place of his circumcision. Seeing this, Zipporah understood that God's anger concerned their failure to circumcise the child. Thus she picked up a flint and circumcised the child on the spot, and the attack on Moses came to an end. Rashi says: \"She was now sure of the cause of his illness, and realized that circumcision had saved his life.\" Zipporah's comment, from Targum Neophyti on Exodus 4:26, \"How beloved is the blood that has delivered this bridegroom from the hand of the Angel of Death,\" is a perfect example of how the Targum changed the meaning of biblical texts by interpolating additional words into them. Here it is the verse You are truly a bridegroom of blood (Exod. 4:25), that serves as the basis of this interpolation. This transforms an enigmatic and fragmentary text into an assured and complete blessing. The two angels, Af and Hemah, are the personifications of Anger and Fury. Af is a male — and Hemah is a female — destroying angel. These furies resemble the Furies of Greek myth. Hemah's role is derived from Proverbs 16:14: The king's wrath (Hemah) is a messenger of death, Af and Hemah go forth together, like Samael and Lilith, and they are paired— and cursed— in Psalms 37:8: Give up anger, abandon fury. Through them God expresses his anger at Moses for not having circumcised his son. In general, there",

      "number": 482,
      "title": "Serah Bat Asher",
      "content": "Serah bat Asher was the daughter of Asher, one of the sons of Jacob. She was among the sixty-nine who ascended with Jacob to Egypt, and she was among those who crossed the Red Sea and were counted by Moses in the census of the wilderness. Serah was still a child when Joseph's brothers asked her to sing a little song for her grandfather, Jacob. For Joseph had sent his brothers to bring the House of Jacob to Egypt, because of the famine in the land. Then Joseph's brothers had to find a way to break the news to Jacob that Joseph was still alive. They said, \"If we tell our Father that Joseph is alive, he might die from the shock.\" And they decided to have Serah play the harp for Jacob and sing the words \"Joseph is alive.\" This Serah gladly did, and when Jacob, who was lost in a reverie, suddenly understood what she was saying, he cried out, \"Is it true?\" And when Serah assured him that it was, Jacob, in his joy, gave her a great blessing, which let her live so long. But there is another version of this account, in which Jacob was furious that Serah had mentioned this most painful episode in his life, the loss of his son Joseph. And Jacob jumped up and pointed to her and said, \"You should live so long!\" And she did. The name Serah bat Asher appears in the Torah only twice, in two lists. Nothing else is said about her. Yet, using the midrashic method, the ancient rabbis were able to create a full identity for her and make her play an essential role in many key biblical episodes. They concluded that she lived longer than anyone else, even Methuselah. It was she who, knowing the sign, identified Moses as the Redeemer; she who helped Moses search for the coffin of Joseph; she who crossed the Red Sea and later reported on what the walls of the Red Sea looked like. This figure, Serah bat Asher, comes to life in the Talmud and the Midrash and becomes one of the favorite figures of the rabbis, whom they draw into the narrative as often as possible. How they did this is an object lesson in the midrashic method. Serah is also used to resolve another apparent contradiction. Genesis 46:27 states that the total of Jacob's household who came to Egypt was 70 persons. However, those listed in Genesis 46:8-25 only total 69. The explanation given in Genesis Kabbah 94:9 is that Serah bat Asher was counted twice. Because of her extreme righteousness and wisdom, she had the value of two. Other sources say that God came with them as the seventieth. The story of Serah bat Asher begins with a name in the list in the passage describing Jacob's journey into Egypt: Jacob and all his offspring with him came to Egypt. He brought with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons , his daughters and granddaughters— all his offspring (Gen. 46:6-7). Among the 69 who accompanied Jacob into Egypt were, as recounted in Genesis 46:17: Asher's sons: Imnah, Ishvi, and Beriah, and their sister Serah. Serah might have remained merely a name in this list if not for a curious parallel. For in another list, in Numbers 26:46, that of the census taken by Moses in the wilderness the name Serah bat Asher appears again: The name of Asher's daughter was Serah. What are we to make of the fact that the same name appears in two lists separated by at least 200 years? From our perspective, it might be discounted as a coincidence. After all, Asher was a respectable name, and it is certainly possible that someone named Asher might name his daughter Serah. But from the point of view of the ancient rabbis, the fact that these two lists had this one name in common cried out for explanation. So they arrived at what was for them the logical conclusion: they were the same person. That resolves the problem of the identity of the two Serahs, but it doesn't explain how she lived so long. However, rabbinic ingenuity found a solution for this problem as well. Using the midrashic method, the rabbis searched for the \"right place.\" This is the place in the text that gives the necessary clue, making it possible to read between the lines. And in this case the clue involved another matter that is missing in the biblical narrative: how the sons of Jacob finally informed him that his beloved son, Joseph, was not dead after all. It all goes back to the brothers' discovery that Joseph was still alive. Indeed, he was none other than the Prince of Egypt. And now that Joseph had revealed his true identity, he commanded his brothers to bring their father and the rest of the family to Egypt, for there was a famine in the land: \" And you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt* an &amp; °f a M that you have seen , and you shall hasten and bring down my father hither\" (Gen. 45:13). This must have presented a dilemma to Joseph's brothers, since they had cast him naked into a pit and then sold him into slavery and then told their father that he had been slain by a wild beast. Now they had to go back to their father, Jacob, a frail old man, and tell him that Joseph was alive after all. Reading between the lines, the rabbis intuited that the brothers were filled with guilt and remorse, as well as with fear that Jacob might die of shock when he heard the news. So they came up with the idea of letting Serah break the news to him. They asked Serah, who apparently was a child, to play the harp for Jacob and sing him a little song, with the words \"Joseph is alive, Joseph is alive.\" Serah, of course, was glad to sing a song for her grandfather, and when Jacob realized what she was saying, he jumped up and asked, \"Is it true?\" And when she told him it was true, he blessed her with such a great blessing that she lived as long as she did! In this way the midrash brought Serah to life and explained how she lived for so long.",

      "content": "Before his death, Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying , \" When God has taken notice of you , you shall carry up my bones from here\" (Gen. 50:25). So when the time came to leave Egypt, Moses searched everywhere for Joseph's coffin, but no one remembered where it was. After Moses had tired himself out searching for it, he encountered Serah bat Asher, who was a survivor of the generation of Joseph. Serah said: \"My lord Moses, why are you so downcast?\" Moses replied: \"For three days and nights I have been searching for Joseph's coffin and I cannot find it.\" She said to him: \"Come with me and I will show you where it is.\" Moses said: \"Who are you, and how do you know where the coffin can be found?\" She said: \"I am Serah bat Asher, and I know for I was present when the leaden coffin of Joseph was sunk into the Nile.\" She led him to a shore of the Nile and there she said: \"In this place the Egyptian magicians and astrologers made a metal coffin for Joseph and sank it into the river Nile, so that its waters should be blessed. Then they returned to Pharaoh and said: 'If it is your wish that these people should never leave this place, then as long as they do not find the bones of Joseph, they will be unable to leave.'\" Some say that Moses then leaned over the bank of the Nile and called out: \"Joseph, Joseph, we are leaving Egypt. The time has come for God to redeem His children, and for the oath you imposed on Israel to be fulfilled. I call on you to appear before me, and I will take your bones to the land of Canaan. If you will show yourself, well and good; if not, behold, we are free of your oath.\" At that moment Joseph's heavy lead coffin shook itself free, rose up from the depths, and floated on the surface, and Moses took it and carried it with him. Others say that Moses took a shard, wrote God's Name upon it, and threw the shard into the river. At once Joseph's coffin floated up to the surface. All the years that the Israelites were in the wilderness there were two arks that accompanied the children of Israel in their wandering, the one containing the remains of Joseph, as it is said. And Moses took with him the bones of Joseph (Exod. 13:19), and the other the Ark of the Tabernacle. The one represented the past and the other, the Torah, defined the future. At the end of Genesis, Joseph, surrounded by his brothers, takes a vow of the future generations: \"I am about to die. God will surely take notice of you and bring you up from this land to the land that He promised on oath to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob.\" So Joseph made the sons of Israel swear , saying , \"When God has taken notice of you , you shall carry up my bones from here . \" Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years; and he was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt (Gen. 50:24-26). This coffin, according to Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael , was sunk in the middle of the Nile. Later it is reported in Exodus 14:19 that Joseph's coffin was carried next to the Ark of the Tabernacle. This raised the question of how the coffin was found, which is answered in this myth. In leading Moses to the place where Joseph's coffin was lowered into the Nile, Serah bat Asher performs her most important task. This midrash fills in a major gap in the biblical narrative between the vow that Joseph made the sons of Israel swear on his deathbed that you shall carry my bones from here (Gen. 50:25) and the report that Moses took the bones of Joseph with him (Exod. 14:19). However, it is Moses who must figure a way to raise up the sunken coffin. In one version of the myth, he calls out to Joseph, saying, \"If you make yourself visible, well and good. If not, we shall be innocent of violating the oath you made our forefathers swear\" ( Pesikta de-Rav Kahana). Thus, if Moses is unable to raise up the coffin, he will at least have done his best to fulfill the oath. One of the miracles of the recovery of Joseph's coffin is that it was made of metal. B. Sota 13a addresses this issue: \"Be not astonished that iron should float,\" and follows with an example (from 2 Kings 6:5-7) of how an axe-head was made to float. B. Sota and Pesikta de-Rav Kahana recount a dialogue with a passerby who saw the two caskets Israel carried in the desert, one the coffin of Joseph and the other containing the tablets of the Law. \"What are these two caskets?\" They answered, \"One is the ark of Joseph, who was mortal, and the other is the Ark of Him who is immortal.\" The passerby asked, \"Is it proper that God's Ark should accompany an ark with a man in it?\" They answered, \"This one contains the bones of Joseph, who fulfilled all the commands that God set down in the other Ark.\"",

      "content": "When Serah bat Asher was among the children of Israel at the Red Sea, she had a vision in which she saw things that none of the others saw. In the vision she saw the multitude of angels who had gathered to watch the children of Israel cross the Red Sea. So too did she see the Divine Presence, who descended among them when Miriam played the tambourine and sang the Song of the Sea. And in that vision Serah even saw the Holy One commanding the waters of the Red Sea to part. For other than Moses, Serah was the only one alive in that generation who could look upon the Holy One and live. There are contradictory traditions about what the Israelites saw at the Red Sea. Some state that a maidservant saw at the sea what Isaiah and Ezekiel and all the prophets never saw, as it is said. The heavens were opened and I saw visions of God (Ezek. 1:1). Regarding Serah's position as a maidservant, Pesikta de-Rav Kahana recounts that upon coming down into Egypt, Serah was enslaved and compelled to bend over a mill in forced labor.",

      "content": "Rabbi Yohanan once asked his students to describe the appearance of the walls of the Red Sea when the waters parted for the children of Israel to cross. When none could do so. Rabbi Yohanan described them as resembling a window lattice. Then, all at once, they heard a voice say: \"No, it was not like that at all!\" And when they looked up, they saw the face of a very old woman peering in the window of the house of study. \"Who are you?\" demanded Rabbi Yohanan. \"I am Serah bat Asher,\" came the reply, \"and I know exactly what the walls resembled. I was there, I crossed the Red Sea — and they resembled shining mirrors, mirrors in which every man, woman, and child was reflected, so that it seemed like an even greater multitude crossed there, not only those of the present, but also those of the past and future as well.\" And when Serah had finished speaking, none dared contradict her, for her knowledge was firsthand. Here is one more example of a midrash in which Serah bat Asher, by this time more than a thousand years old, suddenly appears to resolve a question about the Exodus. Her explanations are definitive for, as she notes, \"I was there.\" As for the reason that the walls shone, Pesikta de-Rav Kahana suggests it was because such personages as Moses and Aaron, who had drunk deep of Torah's waters, made the waters shine.",

      "content": "How long did Serah live? Some say she lived until the days of the Temple, while others say she lived even longer than that. One account has it that she met her death in the ninth century in a fire in a synagogue in Isfahan. And when that synagogue was rebuilt it was named the Synagogue of Serah bat Asher, and the Jews of Persia made pilgrimages to that synagogue, the holiest Jewish site in the land. Others say that Serah bat Asher never died. She was taken to the heavenly Garden of Eden while she was still alive, because she had announced to Jacob that Joseph was alive. There Serah has a palace of her own, where she teaches Torah to the righteous women. And they know that every word she says is true, because she was a witness to all the miracles that took place in those mighty days. There are two legendary accounts of the ultimate fate of Serah. One reports that she met her death in a fire in a synagogue in Isfahan, Persia, in the ninth century. That synagogue was rebuilt and named after her, and it is still the holiest Jewish site in Iran, to which Persian Jews used to make pilgrimages when they were still permitted to do so. However, it is also said that Serah never died, but that she was taken into Paradise alive because she brought Jacob the news that Joseph was still alive (Gen. 45:26). She is counted among the nine who entered Paradise alive ( Derekh Eretz Zuta 1), and it is said that she now is one of the blessed women who teaches Torah to the souls of righteous women in a heavenly palace of her own (Zohar 3:167a-b). See \"Women in Paradise,\" p. 190. As this rich legend of Serah bat Asher makes abundantly clear, it is the latter version that rings true. Serah never died. She was created out of the imagination of the rabbis and she lives on, a living witness to God's miracles during the Exodus who wanders the world, setting things straight.",

And I will stiffen the hearts of the Egyptians so that they go in after them; and I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his warriors, his chariots and his horsemen. Let the Egyptians know that I am Lord, when I gain glory through Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.\" The angel of God, who had been going ahead of the Israelite army, now moved and followed behind them; and the pillar of cloud shifted from in front of them and took up a place behind them, and it came between the army of the Egyptians and the army of Israel. Thus there was the cloud with the darkness, and it cast a spell upon the night, so that the one could not come near the other all through the night. Then Moses held out his arm over the sea and the Lord drove back the sea with a strong east wind all that night, and turned the sea into dry ground. The waters were split, and the Israelites went into the sea on dry ground, the waters forming a wall for them on their right and on their left. The Egyptians came in pursuit after them into the sea, all of Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and horsemen. At the morning watch, the Lord looked down upon the Egyptian army from a pillar of fire and cloud, and threw the Egyptian army into panic. He locked the wheels of their chariots so that they moved forward with difficulty. And the Egyptians said, \"Let us flee from the Israelites, for the Lord is fighting for them against Egypt.\"",

Then the splendor and majesty of the Lord appeared. And when the sea saw the Lord, it fled before Him. Moses said to the sea, \"You did not hearken to me until now. Why have you fled before me?\" And the sea answered, \"I have not fled before you, Moses, but before the Lord, the Creator of the world.\"",
      "commentary": "This myth echoes, and was likely inspired by, midrashic accounts of the reluctance of the upper waters to separate from the lower waters when God created a firmament between them. See \"The Upper Waters and the Lower Waters,\" p. 104. Here the waters of the Red Sea refuse to part at the command of Moses, but when God appears they quickly do as they were told. The underlying meaning of this midrash may be that it was not Moses who accomplished the miracles associated with the Exodus, but God, whose power stood behind everything that Moses did. This interpretation follows rabbinic concern that Moses might be deemed a messianic figure and raised up to divine proportions. The rabbis may have been trying to avoid the kind of Moses fixation found among the Samaritans. To counter this, Moses was left almost entirely out of the Haggadah, despite his central role in freeing the people from Egypt, receiving the Torah, and leading them to the Holy Land.",

      "content": "At the very moment that the children of Israel went into the Red Sea, Mount Moriah began to move from its place, along with the altar for Isaac that had been built upon it. The whole scene had been arranged before the creation of the world. Isaac was bound and placed upon the altar; Abraham's knife was raised. Far away, at the Red Sea, God said to Moses, \"Moses, Moses, My children are in distress, the sea is blocking their path and the enemy is pursuing them, and you stand so long praying? Moses said before God, \"What should I be doing?\" God said, \"Raise up your staff!\" Moses lifted up his staff, the waters of the Red Sea parted, and on Mount Moriah the voice of the angel went forth, \"Do not raise your hand against the boy , or do anything to him \" (Gen. 22: 12). This remarkable midrash from Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael is the clearest possible statement about the nature of midrashic time: there is no before or after; past, present, and future exist simultaneously. Thus the Binding of Isaac on Mount Moriah takes place at the same time as the parting of the waters of the Red Sea. But that is not all— the future event affects the past event. The powers of mercy generated by the parting of the Red Sea save Isaac at the very moment Abraham is about to sacrifice him. This is an astonishing view of timeless history, where future events can affect the past. A similar link between the Akedah, the binding of Isaac, and the parting of the Red Sea is found in Genesis Rabbah . Here, however, the influence is the exact opposite: the",

      "content": "After Pharaoh passed a decree condemning all male children bom to Israelite mothers, many of the mothers who gave birth to boys abandoned them in an open field, for had they brought them home, not only the infants but all of the members of their family would have been slain. What happened to those babies? They were cared for by God Himself. When they were grown, they returned to their families. When they were asked who took care of them, they said, \"A handsome young man took care of all our needs.\" And when the Israelites came to the Red Sea, those children were there, and when they saw God at the sea, they said to their parents, \"That is the one who took care of us when we were in Egypt.\" That is why it is said that every single one of those who crossed the Red Sea could point with his finger and say. This is my God , and I will glorify Him (Exod. 15:2). Because of Pharaoh's decree, most male children bom to Israelite mothers were abandoned. Moses, of course, was raised by Pharaoh's daughter, but what happened to the others? This myth supplies a moving explanation, saying that God, described as \"a handsome young man,\" took care of them. This offers a view of a nurturing God, much as is found in the myth about \"God and the Spirits of the Unborn,\" p. 140 or in \"The Dew of Resurrection,\" p. 504. The boys were able to return to their families once they were grown, since they were no longer infants to be identified by Pharaoh's henchmen. And they were able to identify that \"young man\" at the Red Sea, where God was present. Other myths describe God's appearance at the Red Sea as a mighty warrior. See \"The Warrior God,\" p. 29. In commenting on these varying reports of God's appearance, Rashi quotes God as saying \"Since I change in My appearance to the people, do not say that there are two divine beings\" (on Exod. 20:2).",

The stallions chased the mares until they sank in the sea. That is the meaning of. Horse and driver He has hurled into the sea (Exod. 15:1). When the Egyptians were drowning in the Red Sea, the angels wished to sing a hymn in praise of God, but God silenced them, saying: \"Do not sing today. How can I listen to singing when the works of My hands are drowning in the sea?\"",
      "commentary": "Some say that the angels sought to sing so loudly that the souls of the Egyptians would take leave of this world through the sweetness of their celestial melodies. But God said, \"They have caused My children to perish. Should they die from the sweetness of your singing?\" This is an important talmudic myth, which establishes God's caring for all his creations, even those who are the enemies of his people, Israel. Here the angels want to celebrate the defeat of Pharaoh's army, but God rebukes them. Thus God suffers over the suffering of His creations. This myth is based on the much earlier biblical teachings in Proverbs 24:17 that if your enemy fails, do not exult. Rabbi Shmelke of Nikolsburg (1726-1778) suggests a different interpretation by suggesting that the purpose of the angels in wishing to sing was not to celebrate the deaths of the Egyptians, but to draw out their souls painlessly, and that it is God who objects to this idea, because it does not make them suffer for their sins. This, then, is a good example of how the midrashic method can reverse the meaning of a text entirely.",

Yet it is also recorded that The earth swallowed them (Exod. 15:12). How did this happen? The sea and the earth had a quarrel. The sea said to the earth, \"Receive your children, as it is said. For dust you are and to dust you shall return \" (Gen. 3:19). And the earth said to the sea, \"Receive your slain.\" For the sea did not want to sink them, and the earth did not want to swallow them. The earth was afraid to receive them, lest they testify against it on the Day of Great Judgment in the World to Come— just as Abel's blood did, as it is said, \" Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground\" (Gen. 4:10). At that time God inclined His right hand over the earth and swore an oath that the bodies of the dead would not be permitted to testify against the earth in the World to Come. Then earth then opened its mouth and swallowed them. Still, God did not rejoice in the downfall of the wicked. When Pharaoh's army was drowning in the Red Sea, the ministering angels wanted to chant their hymns, but God said, \"Shall you chant hymns while the work of My hands is being drowned in the sea?\"",
      "commentary": "This myth about a quarrel between the sea and the earth appears in Targum PseudoYonathan on Exodus 15:12, and has been inserted to precede the verse The earth swallowed them (Exod. 15:12). It explains an apparent contradiction in the text, where Pharaoh's army drowns in the Red Sea, but the text says that the earth swallowed them (Exod. 15:12). The switch comes about when the sea calls upon the earth to accept the bodies of the drowned, since they were created from the dust of the earth to begin • with. Thus, in a legalistic manner, the sea requires the earth to fulfill the obligation inherent in For dust you are and to dust you shall return (Gen. 3:19). The earth's concern is also legalistic: it fears that the bodies of the dead might testify against it in the World to Come. But when God swears that the bodies will not testify against the earth, the earth \"opened its mouth and swallowed them.\" For another example of a quarrel between elemental forces, see \"The Quarrel of the Sun and the Moon,\" p. 112. There is a related myth about the drowning of Pharaoh's army in B. Megillah 10b that establishes God's caring for all his creations, even those who are the enemies of His people Israel. Here the angels want to celebrate the defeat of Pharaoh's army, but",

      "content": "During their forty years of wandering in the wilderness, an enchanted well gave the Israelites fresh water to drink. God gave them this well as a gift because of the merits of Miriam, the sister of Moses. It was there for them every day, whenever they were thirsty. How was this possible? It followed the Israelites everywhere they went. It ascended the high mountains with them, and it descended with them to the deep valleys, going around the entire camp of Israel and giving them drink, each and every one of them at the door of his tent. The enchanted well accompanied the children of Israel to the court of the Appointed Tent and stopped there. And the princes of the Congregation approached it, and said, \"Come, O well, and give of your waters!\" And the well gave forth water, and the Congregation and their cattle drank.",
      "commentary": "Some say that well was created at the beginning of Creation, while others say that the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, dug it. Then it was hidden until it was returned to the children of Israel by Moses and Aaron, who rediscovered it. Whatever became of Miriam's well? Some say it disappeared the day that Miriam died; others say it followed the people all the way to the Holy Land. Still others say that the well can still be found traveling from place to place, wherever Jews can be found. Whenever a minyan gathers, it is possible to drink from the well. The existence of Miriam's Well — a well that followed the Israelites through the wilderness, to provide them with fresh water — is suggested by Numbers 21:16-29, where the description of a well that God gives to the people is immediately followed by a list of places they traveled to, suggesting that the well traveled with them to these places. The well itself is identified as the one issued from the rock struck in Exodus 17:3-6. The well was said to have been given because of the merits of Miriam. For a folktale recounting a late encounter with Miriam's well, see \"The Wandering Well\" in Gabriel's Palace , pp. 250-251. See too \"The Angel of Forgetfulness\" in Gabriel's Palace , pp. 81-83, where the Ari restores the harmony of Hayim Vital by having him drink from Miriam's well. The fate of this miraculous well is disputed in various sources. Some say it disappeared after Miriam's death, others that it was restored after a while because of the merits of Aaron and Moses, but taken away after the death of Moses. And a number of folktales describe it as still existing in the Sea of Galilee. There is also a metaphorical link in this myth between Miriam's well and the Torah, which is also seen as an inexhaustible resource to quench a person's thirst for knowledge.",

Moses, and Moses alone, was able to achieve the exalted level of an angel, and therefore, during that period, he required no material sustenance. In at least one case in Jewish lore, that of the metamorphosis of Enoch into Metatron, a human is transformed into an angel. Here Moses does not exactly become an angel, but rather becomes as exalted as an angel, therefore requiring no food or water, since angels do not eat or drink.

      "content": "God honored Moses and gave him all of the earth and sea, and all the rivers and all the other elements. He gave him all the world as a possession suitable for His heir, for Moses was named God and King of the whole nation. So too did Moses enter into the darkness where God was, perceiving things invisible to mortal nature. There he dwelt in the mysteries until he was crowned with light, wearing a robe of light, his face clothed in a beam of light. When Moses reached the peak of Mount Sinai he saw a throne so large that it touched the clouds of heaven. On it sat a man of noble bearing, wearing a crown, with a scepter in one hand. With the other hand He beckoned Moses, who approached and stood before the throne. The man on the throne then handed over the scepter to Moses and beckoned for him to mount the throne, and gave Moses a crown of light. Then that man withdrew from the throne. And Moses sat on the great throne and wrote what his Lord had taught him. Just as there are enthronement myths about Adam, Enoch, Jacob, and King David,",
      "commentary": "this myth describes the enthronement of Moses. For Philo the role attributed to Moses transcended that of a prophet and came closer to that of a messianic or divine figure. In this astonishing myth, Moses is invited to take the place of the enthroned figure who clearly seems to represent God, although this figure might be identified with the Glory of the Lord, which Ezekiel describes as that of a human form seated upon a throne: Above the expanse over their heads was the semblance of a throne, in appearance like sapphire ; and on top , upon this semblance of a throne, there was the semblance of a human form (Ezek. 1:26-28). A similar enthronement of Adam is described in The Testament of Abraham . See \"The Enthronement of Adam,\" p. 131. Here Philo describes Moses in terms that elevate him from a human hero to one who is virtually divine, while Ezekiel the Tragedian describes the actual enthronement of Moses. At the end of the enthronement, it seems as if God turns over His scepter and His throne to Moses and withdraws. The other primary sources for this myth are found in the Samaritan text Memar Markah and Samaritan hymns. The Samaritans, a Palestinian sect closely related to Judaism, regarded Moses as an elevated, near-messianic figure, and it is not surprising that Samaritan texts sometimes stray into the realm of elevating Moses to a godly status. The surprising description of Moses as God and King echoes Exodus 7:1: \"See, I place you in the role of God to Pharaoh .\"",

      "content": "God said to Moses, \"I will bring you up to My Throne of Glory, and I will show you the angels of heaven.\" Then God commanded Metatron, the Prince of the Presence, \"Go and bring Moses into heaven.\" But Metatron replied, \"Master of the Universe, Moses cannot ascend to heaven because the angels consist of fire, but he is only flesh and blood.\" God said, \"Go and change his body into fire.\" So Metatron went to Moses, and Moses trembled with fear when he saw him. \"Who are you?\" Moses asked. Metatron replied, \"I am Enoch, son of Jared. God has sent me to bring you to His Throne of Glory.\" Moses said, \"I am only flesh and blood and cannot look upon the angels.\" Then Metatron changed Moses' tongue into a fiery tongue, and he made his eyes like wheels of the Divine Chariot, and he gave him the powers of the angels and brought him into heaven.",
      "commentary": "Here the ruling angel Metatron transforms Moses into fire just as Metatron himself was once transformed from being the human Enoch. The implication is that Moses will now take the place of Metatron as the chief among the angels. This myth must be seen in the context of those Jews (and Samaritans) for whom Moses was viewed as a messianic figure. In this myth Moses is raised even higher than that, and therefore this must be regarded as an enthronement myth about Moses, just as such myths are found about Adam, Enoch, Jacob, and King David. See \"The Enthronement of Moses,\" p. 388 for another example of an enthronement myth about Moses.",

      "content": "So Moses came down from Mount Sinai. And as Moses came down from the mountain bearing the two tablets of the Pact, Moses was not aware that the skin of his face was radiant, since he had spoken with God. Aaron and all the Israelites saw that the skin of Moses' face was radiant; and they shrank from coming near him. But Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the chieftains in the assembly returned to him, and Moses spoke to them. Afterward all the Israelites came near, and he instructed them concerning all that the Lord had imparted to him on Mount Sinai. And when Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face. Whenever Moses went in before the Lord to speak with Him, he would leave the veil off until he came out; and when he came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded, the Israelites would see how radiant the skin of Moses' face was. Moses would then put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with Him. After his encounter with God at Mount Sinai, the skin of Moses' face was radiant. This aura surrounding his face was so bright it frightened Aaron and all the chieftains. leading Moses to put on a veil, which Moses wore except when he spoke with God. Such auras are a common result of mystical experience. See, for example, \"A Vision at the Wailing Wall,\" p. 63.",

      "title": "The Light That Shone From Moses' Face",
      "content": "When Moses descended Mount Sinai after forty days and nights, his body was bathed with invisible light, and an aura shone from his face that surpassed the splendor of the sun. Those who saw him were filled with awe, for his appearance was far more beautiful than when he had gone up. So bright was the dazzling light that flashed from his face, that all the righteous among the children of Israel were burned when they observed it. Some say that radiance clung to Moses after he spoke with God face to face, as it is said. The skin of his face was radiant , since he had spoken with Him (Exod. 34:29). Others say that the radiance shone forth from the cave where God put His Hand in front of his face, as it is said, \"And I will shield you with My Hand\" (Exod. 33:22). Still others say that light was the light of the first day, which God restored to Moses upon Mount Sinai, and which Moses drew upon for the rest of his life. Then there are those who explain that for forty days and forty nights, Moses dipped his pen in black fire and wrote down all that the Lord commanded him to write. And when he finished writing, he saw that a drop of fire was still left upon the pen. And Moses took the pen and passed it over the hair of his head, and the skin of his face shone with radiance. That is why the children of Israel were unable to approach him until he put a veil over his face. When Aaron and the others saw the light shining from the face of Moses, they were afraid to come near him, for that light was a reflection of the divine radiance. Nor did that light go away. Indeed, Moses became a permanent source of light. And after that he wore a veil on his face at all times, except when he met with God or taught the Torah. Biblical commentators seek out the source of the divine radiance that shone from the face of Moses, as recounted in Exodus 34:29-35. See \"Divine Radiance,\" p. 389. Rashi proposes that it was caused by God covering the face of Moses with His Hand. This interpretation, also found in Midrash Tanhuma, refers to Exodus 33:22-23: Wien My glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock , and I will cover you with My Hand until I pass by. Then I will take away My Hand . Ibn Ezra notes that the light that shone from the face of Moses shone like the light of the firmament. Rabbi Hayim ben Attar, author of Or ha-Hayim, asserts that the light continued to shine, so that Moses became a permanent source of light, and had to wear a veil. The fact that this veil was only lifted for the people when Moses taught Torah suggests that while teaching Torah, he revealed the unveiled truth. This also suggests that whoever studies Torah comes face to face with the divine radiance. What was the source of the divine radiance? It may be an intrinsic quality of the light that shines from God. The Zohar identifies it as the light of the first day of creation, which is said to exist in the World to Come. See \"The Light of the First Day,\" p. 83. The Zohar also states that this light shone from the face of Moses during the first three months after his birth, but the light was withdrawn when the infant Moses was taken to Pharaoh's palace, and was returned to him only when he stood on Mount Sinai. One strange explanation for the rays of light that shone from Moses is found in Exodus Kabbah 47:6, where Rabbi Yehudah bar Nachman suggests that after Moses had finished writing down the Torah there was a little ink left over on the quill. Moses touched his forehead while holding the quill, and the ink that spilled on to his fore-",

How long will You have no pity upon Your children, who are made slaves among the nations of the world? Have You no pity?\" Then God answered each and every one of them, saying, \"Since these wicked ones have sinned and transgressed, how can I deliver them from among the nations of the world and reveal My kingdom?\" Hearing this, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob began to weep. Then God said to them, \"Abraham, My beloved, Isaac My elect, Jacob, My firstborn, how can I save them at this time?\" Then Michael, the Prince of Israel, cried out with a loud, tormented voice and said, \"Why do You stand far off, O Lord?\"",

      "title": "The Pillar Of Cloud",
      "content": "During forty years of wandering, the Israelites were led by a pillar of cloud during the day and by a pillar of fire at night. Moses looked to the pillar of fire to guide them on their journey. When Moses saw the pillar of cloud rise above the Tabernacle, he stood and cried out to the people, and when they heard this they made ready to journey. They gathered together their vessels and precious things and put them upon their cattle. And anyone who had no beast to carry his burden put all his precious things upon the cloud that went before the camp. And they blew the trumpets, and the tribe of Judah journeyed first. Then the pillar of cloud guided them as they journeyed to the Holy Land. Many centuries later, as Rabbi Moshe Cordovero lay on his deathbed, his disciples begged him to reveal his successor. But the Ramak, as the rabbi was known, refused to do so. Instead he told them to watch for a sign: whoever saw a pillar of cloud at his funeral would be the one they should follow. This greatly confused the disciples, and when the Ramak died, all of Safed was filled with mourning. As the funeral procession reached the graveyard, a young disciple named Rabbi Isaac Luria, approached Rabbi Joseph Karo, and said: \"Ever since we left the synagogue, there has been a pillar of cloud going before us.\" He pointed to it, but it was invisible to all the others. And when he entered into it, he vanished from their sight. For a long moment everyone stood in disbelief. Then Rabbi Isaac stepped out of the cloud, which only he could see, and his face was glowing like the face of Moses as he descended Mount Sinai. And indeed it was the same cloud that had enveloped Moses at the top of Sinai, and carried him into heaven, so that he could receive the Torah from the finger of God. Then they all understood that this was the sign the Ramak had given them, and that Rabbi Isaac was destined to be their teacher. So it was that after the funeral many of the disciples of the Ramak came to Rabbi Isaac and asked to study with him. At first the Ari, as he came to be known, was reluctant, for until then he had concealed his holy ways. But at last he agreed, and for the two years that he remained in this world, he was their master of Torah, and his teachings still echo to this day. The pillar of cloud led the Israelites in their desert wandering during the day, as stated in Exodus 13:21: And Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them along the way. This story links Rabbi Moshe Cordovero with Rabbi Isaac Luria, the Ari, explaining how the Ari became his successor. Thus, in a single stroke, this tale links the Ari both to his immediate predecessor, Moshe Cordovero, and to the biblical Moses. The fact that both are named Moses (Moshe in Hebrew) only underscores the link between them. Thus the story suggests that the Ari and his predecessors were of the stature of the biblical patriarchs, and that the miracles of the sort that occurred in the time of Moses could still occur in their own time.",

      "title": "The Seven Clouds Of Glory",
      "content": "As the Israelites wandered through the wilderness, they were covered by seven clouds of glory, one cloud on each of their four sides, one cloud above them, so that rain or hail would not fall on them, and so that they would not be burned by the burning heat of the sun, and one cloud below them so that thorns and serpents and scorpions would not harm them — and one cloud went before them to level the valleys and lower the mountains, and to prepare a dwelling place for them. Targum Pseudo-Yonathan appends this description of the seven clouds of glory that accompany the Israelites to the verse The Israelites journeyed from Raamses to Succoth (Exod. 12:37). Just as the myth of Miriam's Well provided fresh water for the Israelites in their desert wanderings, this myth describes seven clouds of glory that protected the Israelites from above and below and even a cloud that went before them to level valleys and lower mountains. Behind these myths is the awareness that travel in the desert is treacherous, with dangers on all sides, especially dangers from the elements. The 40 years of wandering of the Israelites was doubtless filled with great suffering, but since the Exodus is regarded as a great liberation, these myths arose to portray the Exodus as taking place under the complete protection of God.",

      "title": "Moses' Last Request",
      "content": "When the time came for Moses to take leave of this world, he made one last request to God: \"Grant my wish, O Lord. Command the heavens to open and be split asunder, so that light shines in the darkness, so that the eyes of the children of Israel may be opened and they shall see there is none beside You, O Lord, in the heavens and the earth.\" No sooner did Moses finish speaking than the seven heavens were opened and all the depths were cleft asunder, and a great light shone in the darkness. And the eyes of the children of Israel were opened and they saw there is nothing in heaven or on earth to compare with the splendor of God, and they called out to each other, \"Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God , the Lord alone \" (Deut. 6:4).",
      "commentary": "Here the last request Moses makes is not for himself, but for the people of Israel, that the heavens be split apart so that the people could see the splendor of God. Throughout the long wandering in the wilderness, the people continually lost faith both in Moses and in God. Here Moses tries once more to renew their faith, and God grants his last wish. It is interesting to note that just as Moses' first experience of God closely resembles a mystical experience, here his last experience before dying is also a mystical revelation, although here it is a collective, rather than a personal one.",

      "title": "Joshua As Oedipus",
      "content": "Joshua's father was a holy man who lived in Egypt. He and his wife had no children, so the Tzaddik prayed to God for a child, and God heard his prayers. But while she was pregnant, heaven revealed to him that the son who would be bom to him would one day cut off his head. On learning this, the holy man mortified himself and wept day and night. His wife could not understand this, since God had seen fit to bless them with a child. She said, \"You should rejoice at the Lord's blessing.\" Then the Tzaddik revealed his vision to her, and she knew that his words must be true. It came to pass that a son, Joshua, was bom to them. And his mother put him in an ark made of pitch and slime and cast it into the Nile, and God saw to it that a great fish swallowed the ark. Now it happened that the king gave a feast for all his princes. And the fish that had swallowed the ark was caught that day and brought before the king. And when they cut it open, they discovered a weeping child. The king and all the princes marveled at this, and the king ordered a woman to be found to nurse the child. And the boy grew up in the palace of the king and came to serve as a guardsman. Years later it happened that Joshua's father transgressed against the king. The king ordered the guardsman to cut off his head, and to take his wife and property for himself, for that was the custom in those days. Thus it came to pass that Joshua did execute him, as the king had commanded. But when he approached his mother, to lie with her, milk began to spill from her breasts, filling the bed with milk. Fearing the woman was a witch, Joshua was about to slay his mother when she remembered the prophecy of Joshua's father, and she cried out to him, \"This is not sorcery. This milk is the same milk you suckled, for you are my son.\" And she revealed all that had happened. Then Joshua told her how he had been found inside a fish, and how he had never known his true mother and father. Then they knew that heaven's prophecy had been fulfilled. And now that he knew the truth, Joshua repented of his sins against his parents. and his repentance was accepted in the eyes of God. And he came to serve Moses, and when Moses took leave of this world, he led the children of Israel into the Promised Land. This remarkable story is a Jewish retelling of the Oedipus myth, in which Joshua bin Nun, the successor of Moses, who led the Israelites into the Land of Israel, is said to have earlier fulfilled the prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother. At the same time, this myth retells the story of the infant Moses being left in an ark made of pitch in the Nile (Exod. 2:3-6), and like Moses, Joshua is also said to have been raised in Pharaoh's palace. Note that this version of the tale refers to Pharaoh as a king, demonstrating a certain distance from the biblical tale.",
      "commentary": "So too does this myth draw directly from the story of Jonah, who was swallowed by a whale (Jonah 2:1). Here the fish swallows the ark containing the infant Joshua, and the child is discovered alive inside the fish, an appropriate discovery for a child marked by destiny. This imaginative myth may have been inspired by the name of the father of the biblical Joshua: \"Nun,\" the Aramaic word for \"fish.\" It seems clear that this myth was intended to provide a mythic origin for Joshua, in order to present him as a worthy successor to Moses, indeed, one with an equally remarkable origin. At the same time, it serves as a vehicle for a Jewish version of Oedipus. Finally, it vividly demonstrates the power of redemption. Here the story diverges entirely from the Oedipus myth, which culminates in the tragedy of Oedipus blinding himself. Instead, this Jewish version has Joshua's repentance entirely accepted, and he ends up leading the people. Leading, of course, requires good vision, and the contrast to the blind Oedipus is obvious. Thus this myth must also be viewed as a Jewish answer to Oedipus. The answer is that no man's sins are beyond repentance. In overtly combining three very famous myths — the story of the baby Moses left in the ark, the story of Jonah being swallowed by the whale, and the myth of Oedipus— this myth about Joshua demonstrates its literary as well as its mythic intentions. It has all the earmarks of a consciously created myth, invented in order to add mythic resonance to the story of Joshua, which is otherwise entirely overshadowed by that of Moses.",

      "title": "Moses Never Died",
      "content": "Moses never died, instead he is in exile with the Shekhinah, and God has given him the task of taking the people of Israel and the Shekhinah out of exile. Just as Moses led the children of Israel out of slavery and to the Promised Land, so too will he lead them out of exile. Meanwhile, God has cast a deep sleep upon Moses, and he will sleep until the time comes for the exile of the Jewish people to come to an end. That Moses never died is deduced from the biblical verse that asserts that No one knows his burial place to this day (Deut. 34:6). As evidence that Moses is sleeping and not dead, Sifre on Deuteronomy reinterprets the verse Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died, his eyes were undimmed and his vigor unabated (Deut. 34:7). Here the final phrase reads literally \"his moisture had not dried up,\" and apparently implies that even at the advanced age when he died, Moses was still sexually potent. In the Sifre , Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya'akov says: \"Do not read 'his moisture had not dried up/ but rather read 'his moisture is not dried up' — even until now anyone who touches the flesh of Moses, moisture ascends here and there.\" In the Talmud, the verse And he was there with Yahweh (Exod. 34:28) is offered as evidence that Moses did not die, but is still \"standing\" (i.e., living) and ministering to God (B. Sota 13b). In Zohar 1:28a, one reason given for Moses avoiding death is that because he perfected himself during his lifetime, he rectified the sin of Adam that brought death into the world. Therefore he did not die.",

      "number": 508,
      "title": "King David Is Crowned In Heaven",
      "content": "There are two thrones in heaven, one belonging to God and the other to King David, for King David was not only crowned on earth, but he was also crowned in heaven. The coronation took place in a great House of Study in the seventh heaven, where a fiery throne awaited him. Groups of angels wove garments of salvation and made crowns of life, fixing precious stones and pearls in them, and anointing them with all kinds of spices and delight. All of these were destined for David, King of Israel. Every kind of angel came forth, as well as all of the heavenly creatures. So too were all of the heavenly treasuries present, along with the clouds of glory, the stars, and all the constellations. Suddenly all of them trembled and cried out, \"The heavens declare the glory of God\" (Ps. 19:1) and lo! King David stood before his throne, facing the throne of God, with all the kings of the House of David before him, and all the kings of Israel behind him. Then God took His crown and put it on David's head. King David's heavenly crown had the sun, moon, and the twelve constellations fixed on it, its radiance radiating from one end of the world to the other. When the crown was placed on his head. King David began to recite psalms of unimaginable beauty that had never been heard before. All the angels and heavenly creatures joined in, along with the firmaments, so that the song echoed everywhere, \"God is one and His name is one.\" Then a loud voice came forth from Eden, crying, \"The Lord shall reign forever and ever!\" and King David ascended to the heavenly Temple, where a throne of fire was set for him forty parasangs in height. And when David came and sat down upon his throne, which was opposite the throne of his Creator, he uttered songs and prayers such as had not been heard since the creation of the world. In B. Sanhedrin 38a, Rabbi Akiba states that there are two thrones in heaven, one for God and one for King David. This angers Rabbi Jose, who says, \"Akiba, how long will you profane the Shekhinahl Rather, one throne is for justice and the other for mercy.\" This follows the interpretation that God has two heavenly thrones. When He sits on the Throne of Mercy, He is merciful, and when He sits on the Throne of Justice, He is harsh in His judgment. Later, in Midrashei Geulah and Masekhet Atzilut and other texts, this undeveloped myth about King David sharing the role of ruling the world with God is elaborated, with a detailed description of King David's heavenly coronation. God takes His crown and puts it on David's head. This is a very radical myth. It elevates King David to the celestial realm, where he undergoes a heavenly coronation. Thus David can be seen not only as God's representative on earth, but one who participates fully in the ritual of divine kingship. The myth strongly implies that David's role is parallel to that of God, whose throne he faces, making him a \"lesser Yahweh.\" In this way the myth resembles those about other saintly figures who became the focus of Jewish cults, such as Enoch/Metatron and Jacob. See the Introduction, pp. 1, lvii-lviii. Hekhalot Rabbati reaffirms David's role as co-ruler of heaven. Together, these three texts demonstrate the development of the myth of King David ruling with God in heaven, which starts off as a very brief statement by Rabbi Akiba in the Talmud. The most extensive divinization tradition among the patriarchs and kings is that associated with Jacob. See \"Jacob the Divine,\" p. 366. One passage in the Bible hints at such a tradition associated with King Solomon: Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king (1 Chron. 29:23). In Song of Songs Rabbah 1:13 Rabbi Isaac asks: \"Is it possible for a man to sit on the throne of the Lord?\" Even raising this question hints at Solomon s divine elevation. There are also enthronement myths about Adam and Moses. See \"The Enthronement of Adam,\" p. 131 and \"The Enthronement of Moses,\" p. 388.",

      "content": "A harp hung above King David's bed, and precisely at midnight a north wind arrived and blew on the harp and it would play by itself. Then King David would arise and study Torah until the break of dawn. This is a famous talmudic legend about King David's harp. This brief legend transforms that harp into an enchanted one. This legend echoes Genesis 1:2: The spirit of God hovered over the waters . Here God's spirit hovers over the waters the way the wind blows on the strings of the harp. Later in Jewish folklore, this same harp became the object of fairytale quests. See, for example, \"King David's Harp\" in Miriam's Tambourine , pp. 163-167. In Likutei Moharan Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav offers an allegorical reading: the five strings of the harp represent the Five Books of Moses. The wind represents the hidden spirit (ruah— which also means \"wind\") in each Jew. When that spirit comes in contact with the five strings of the harp (the Five Books of Moses), the music of new revelations is produced. For Rabbi Nachman, waking up refers to everyone's need to wake up spiritually.",

David looked up and saw the angel of the Lord standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand directed against Jerusalem. David and the elders, covered in sackcloth, threw themselves on their faces. King David's vision of a giant angel standing between heaven and earth with a drawn sword in his hand is certainly terrifying and memorable. The meaning of this myth is that Jerusalem was on the verge of total destruction when God intervened, just as He had done with the sacrifice of Isaac, and prevented it at the last minute.",

      "commentary": "This is a little-known tradition about King David, which links David to Moses by evoking Mount Sinai at the time of the Giving of the Torah. In addition, it reaffirms that the God of King David is the same God of Moses, known by the Name YHVH. This myth also echoes the midrashic tradition about Abraham and Isaac seeing a holy light — the light of the Shekhinah — surrounding Mount Moriah. Thus one brief myth manages to create a line of continuity between Abraham, Moses, and David, while emphasizing that they all worshipped the same God.",

      "title": "The Thirty-six Just Men",
      "content": "In each generation there are thirty-six just men, known as the Lamed-vav Tzaddikim, the thirty-six righteous ones. They are hidden saints who are blessed to be able to see the Shekhinah. The world exists because of their merit. When one of them dies, another is bom to take his place. Because of these thirty-six just men, God permits the world to exist. Thus they are the pillars of existence. Few are those who escape the punishments of Gehenna. But when these saints take leave of this world, their souls immediately ascend on high, to the heavenly rewards awaiting them. The myth of the 36 hidden saints — known as the Lamed-vav Tzaddikim — first appears in the Talmud and later becomes a staple of folk, kabbalistic, and Hasidic tales. B. Sanhedrin 97b suggests that each of these righteous men must be approved by the Shekhinah. The number of hidden saints varies at first, with some texts listing the number as 30 ( Genesis Rabbah 35:2), and some as 45 (B. Hullin 45a). However, the number 36 became the standard, perhaps because it is twice 18 — heh in Hebrew — which also means \"life.\" It was believed that any stranger could turn out to be one of the Lamed-vav Tzaddikim , and therefore respect should be shown to everyone. Many of the tales about the just men describe them as living in remote places, such as forests, where they engage in mystical study. Andre Schwarz-Bart wrote a famous novel. The Last of the Just , based on this myth, although he revised it in substantial ways. In the novel, the hidden saints descend from a single family line. Yisroel Yakov Klapholtz published a two-volume collection of tales about the 36 just men, entitled Lamed-Vav Tzaddikim Nistarim.",

      "content": "The Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and placed there the man whom He had formed. And from the ground the Lord God caused to grow every tree that was pleasing to the sight and good for food, with the Tree of Life in the middle of the garden, and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. A river issues from Eden to water the garden, and it then divides and becomes four branches. The name of the first is Pishon, the one that winds through the whole land of Havilah, where the gold is. (The gold of that land is good; bdellium is there, and lapis lazuli.) The name of the second river is Gihon, the one that winds through the whole land of Cush. The name of the third river is Tigris, the one that flows east of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. The Lord God took the man and placed him in the garden of Eden, to till it and tend it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, \"Of every tree of the garden you are free to eat; but as for the tree of knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat of it; for as soon as you eat of it, you shall die.\" The Garden of Eden serves as the primary archetype of the lost Paradise where our ancestors, Adam and Eve, failed a divine test and were cast out. As a wandering desert people, much like the Bedouins of today, the ancient Hebrews would naturally look forward to finding the next oasis. Such an oasis, with many kinds of fruit trees, was probably the original model for the Garden of Eden, the ultimate oasis. Not only do Adam and Eve have everything they need while living in the Garden, but God sometimes walks there in the cool of the day (Gen. 3:8). They only have one rule to obey: not to eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. Of course. Eve and then Adam cannot resist tasting the forbidden fruit. Like Pandora, they unleash the unknown and find themselves exiled from the Garden of Eden. From a psychological perspective, the Garden of Eden might be seen as childhood, the kind of childhood where a child lives in a protected world and all of his or her needs are met. It is the discovery of sex that causes them to be expelled from the Garden, from childhood, and the world outside the garden requires great effort on their part to survive. From this perspective the Fall might be viewed as the tasting of the forbidden fruit — sex.",

      "content": "The Garden of Eden is well hidden. It is closed on every side, and guarded in a number of ways so that none can see it, not even the angels or the eye of a prophet or seer, as it is said. No eye has seen it, Lord, but You (Isa. 64:3) . Indeed, just as a nut is enclosed within a shell, so Eden is a world within. For theGarden of Eden was planted by God Himself, as it is said. The Lord God planted a garden in Eden (Gen. 2:8), and He planted it with His complete Name. — The Garden of Eden is the dwelling place of holy souls, both those who have already descended to this world and those who will descend in the future. These souls are said to be entirely preoccupied with Torah. In this way they are unified with God and absorbed into the light of God. Since no one knows where the Garden of Eden can be found, this myth offers one explanation of its fate. For once Adam and Eve were expelled from the garden, it largely vanishes from the Bible. However, it often reappears in every phase of subsequent Jewish literature. This myth explains that it is hidden, which is why it is not encountered more often. A different explanation is found in 3 Baruch 4:10, where the Garden is said to have been lost in the Flood: \"When God brought the Flood, the water entered Paradise and killed every flower.\"",
      "commentary": "This myth also serves as a commentary on Genesis 2:8, The Lord God planted a garden in Eden, and on the verse from the Song of Songs 6:11 , 1 went down to the nut grove. The latter verse is often interpreted mystically, with the nut grove understood to refer to the Garden of Eden. In kabbalah, on the other hand, the Garden of Eden was not an actual, physical location, but a mystical one, very possibly an internal state, which one reaches by mystical means. In Torat Moshe on Genesis 2:9, Rabbi Moshe Alshekh describes the Garden of Eden as essentially supernatural. But when a branch or leaf is taken out of the garden, it becomes a regular earthly branch or leaf. Thus the olive branch that Noah's dove brought from the Garden of Eden turned into a real one. For folktales about such a journey to the Garden of Eden, see 'The Prince of Coucy\" in Miriam's Tambourine , pp. 173-185, and \"The Waters of Eternal Life/' pp. 122-134, and \"The Gates of Eden\" in Gabriel's Palace , p. 62. Note that the term Gan Eden , literally, the \"Garden of Eden,\" has two meanings — it refers to the earthly garden, but it also refers to Paradise, and in Jewish lore the two meanings often blur into one. These two meanings also gave birth to the notion that there are two gardens — the earthly garden where Adam and Eve once made their home and the heavenly Eden, which is Paradise. A discussion of the upper and lower Gan Eden is found in Zohar 3:182b.",

      "content": "The Tree of Knowledge was forbidden to Adam, but not the Tree of Life. God did not prevent Adam from eating from the Tree of Life. He was free to do so. But after Adam sinned with the Tree of Knowledge, he was not allowed near the Tree of Life. Why? Because the Tree of Knowledge is the gateway for entering the Tree of Life.",
      "commentary": "Here we find a paradox worthy of Kafka: although God had forbidden Adam from eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, he was free to eat from the Tree of Life. And it is true that the Genesis narrative does not forbid Adam from eating from the Tree of ‘Life. But after Adam sinned by eating the forbidden fruit, h e was expelled from the Qarden of Eden, and cherubim were placed before t he gates of Eden to svard theivay to ^TTrerofUfe (Uen73:23). Thus, alter he sinned, the Tree of Life became forbidden to Adam. Yet, paradoxically, Gikatilla comments that the Tree of Knowledge was the gateway to the Tree of Life. This suggests that Adam could not have tasted of the Tree of Life without first tasting of the Tree of Knowledge. See \"Paradise\" by Kafka, p. 445. Gikatilla's paradox grows out of his kabbalistic interpretation of the Genesis account of the two trees. For him, the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge symbolizes the kelippot , the \"shells\" or \"husks\" that represent forces of evil and result in separation and banishment. Thus when Adam ate of the forbidden fruit, he reaped a harvest of banishment. At the same time, the Tree of Knowledge represents Malkhut, one of the ten sefirot, while the Tree of Life symbolizes Tiferet, another of the sefirot. And Malkhut serves as the gateway to Tiferet in the kabbalistic system of emanations.",

      "title": "The Ever-turning Sword Of Flame",
      "content": "After Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden, God stationed east of the Garden of Eden the cherubim and the fiery ever-turning sword, to guard the way to the Tree of Lif e (Gpn 3-74) After that, no one had permission to enter there, except for the souls of the righteous who were purified by the cherubim. If they see a soul worthy of entering, they admit it, but if it is not, they drive it away, and it is punished by the flame of the ever-turning sword. There are two distinct phases in the role of the Garden of Eden in Jewish lore. The * ™ rst account °f Adam and Eve's life in the garden and their subsequent expulsion. The second concerns the role of the garden after that, in which it becomes theplace that the souls of the righteous enter on their journey into Paradise. See \"The Path of the Soul in the Garden of Eden,\" p. 168. The role of the cherubim (a type of angel) is clear in the first case, in that they were stationed at the gates of Eden in order to prevent Adam and Eve from reentering there For having tasted the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, they had become mortal, and therefore were no longer permitted access to the Tree of Life. This, at least, is the impli’ Ca j°tj ° f . G “ eSiS ^ Ut W ^ at purpose do the cherubim serve after the time of Adam and Eve. They continue to serve as gatekeepers, keeping away anyone who tries to enter the garden, as does Alexander the Great. See \"The Gates of Eden,\" p. 406. But once the Garden of Eden takes on its new role as the entry point for the souls of the righteous on their way to Paradise, the role of the cherubim also changed. From this point on they not only kept out those who were not permitted to enter, but they also admitted the souls of the righteous who were permitted to enter there. Somehow the cherubim were able to determine at once whether or not a soul was righteous enough to deserve entry As for those who were not, they were not only chased off, but, as stated in this myth from the Zohar, they were burned by the flame of the revolving sword. The cherubim play a similar role in the traditions about the High Priest entering the Holy of Holies of the Temple in Jerusalem on Yom Kippur. Two cherubim were portrayed on the cover of the Ark, and they were said to stand guard just like the cherubim that guard the gates of Eden. When the High Priest entered, he entered in . awe and dread. If he were worthy he would enter in peace and exit in peace. But if he were not worthy, a flame would shoot out from between the cherubim— similar to flame of the ever-turning sword — and he would die.",

      "content": "The Cave of the Four Winds can be found at the entrance of a small cave in the Garden of Eden, not far from the Tree of Knowledge. That cave is covered by a curtain on which are inscribed many secret symbols. It is said that if a comer of that curtain is lifted, a great blast of wind will escape, enough to toss boulders into the air as if they were apples, and uproot trees planted on the sixth day of creation. If the entire curtain is lifted, the four winds will be set free, and the world will return to chaos and void. Rabbinic literature and medieval Jewish folklore greatly elaborate on the details of the earthly and heavenly Paradise. Here is the description of a cave in the Garden of Eden that contains all the winds. All that prevents the world from returning to chaos is this curtain, inscribed with secret symbols, that hangs before it. This myth can be read as a warning against delving into forbidden secrets, such as spells and other kinds of magic. Or, from a modem perspective, it can be seen as a warning against the dangers of nuclear destruction. This myth about the Cave of the Four Winds is found in the story \"The Prince of Coucy.\" See Miriam's Tambourine , pp. 173-185.",

      "content": "During his journeys, Alexander the Great once stopped by a stream. He had some salted fish with him, and when he washed it in the waters it gave off a wonderful fragrance. Alexander then drank some of that water and felt remarkably refreshed. He said: \"This stream must come from the Garden of Eden. Let us see if we can find its source.\" So Alexander followed the stream until he reached the Gates of Eden. The gates were guarded by an angel with a flaming sword. The others in his company hid from the sight of the angel, but Alexander stood before the angel and said: \"Open the gates for me!\" The angel replied: \"This is the gateway of the Lord , the righteous shall enter through it\" (P s. 118:20)., When Alexander saw that he would not be admitted, he said: \"I am a king who is highly regarded. Give me something!\" Then the angel gave him an eye. Alexander went and weighed it against all his gold and silver, but the eye outweighed them all. He asked the angel how this was possible, and the angel said: \"The eye of a human being is never satisfied.\" And Alexander asked: \"How can you prove that this is true?\" And the angel answered: \"Take some dust and cover the eye and you will see for yourself.\" Alexander did this, and all at once the eye was restored to its true weight.",
      "commentary": "There are many legends about Alexander the Great in Jewish lore. This one from the Talmud teaches Alexander the lesson that the lust of the human eye is limitless but is easily quenched by dust, that is, by death. Alexander learns this at the gates of the Garden of Eden, which is the one place that Alexander cannot conquer in the world, just as he cannot conquer death. Thus the moral of the tale is that there are built-in limits to the satisfaction of human desire, a moral that is appropriately directed at Alexander, a folk symbol of one who sought to go beyond all human limits. For other Jewish tales about the exploits of Alexander, see \"Alexander Descends into the Sea\" in Miriam's Tambourine, pp. 118-121, and \"The Waters of Eternal Life,\" in the same book, pp. 122-134. According to Rabbi Samuel Eliezer Edels, known as the Maharsha, only those who do not amass worldly goods can enter the Garden of Eden.",

      "content": "At the time of the creation, God decreed that the seventy nations that descended from Adam be placed in the charge o f seventy g uardi an angels , each nation being ruled by its own angel. Thus all the people of the world are watched over by guardian angels. God divided the world among these heavenly ministers, each one receiving a portion of the land upon which his nation dwells. The fate of a particular nation below depends on the status of its guardian angel. When the angel prospers, so does his nation; when he falls, so does his nation. Thus it is written that Yahweh will punish the host of heaven in heaven, and the kings of the earth on earth (Isa. 24:21). One land, however, was notentrusted to any minister. The Land of Israel is the center of the inhabited earth, so He put no angels, no officers, rulers or sovereigns over it. God kept it for Himself, saying, I am keeping this land under My own dominion, and when I find a man upon the earth who will follow My heart, I will place him as a seal upon My heart and settle him in this land. He will be guided directly by My authority, without any intermediary among the heavenly ministers, unlike the other nations.\" So too did God say, \"Let Israel, who became My portion, inherit the land which became My portion.\" God provides sustenance there first, and only then to the rest of the world. All angels sing God's praises, but the guardian angels of the seventy nations can only sing to God under certain circumstances. The opportunity comes when a particular nation does some act of kindness to Israel. Then its guardian angel receives permission to sing before God. When the guardian angels of other nations fall from power, all memory of their existence is completely wiped off the face of the earth. But when Israel, because of its transgressions, is oppressed by other nations, it is in a state of exile, under the dominion of their guardian angels. But, though it is subject to other nations and their guardian angels, Israel can never be totally destroyed, for its guardian and head is none other than God. Thus the Jewish people shall abide eternally and inherit the earth and its fullness.",
      "commentary": "This myth explains the unique nature of the relationship between God and Israel, and of the centrality of the Land of Israel in that relationship. It explains that at the time God created the world. He distributed the various lands to the heavenly ministers and chose the Land of Israel for Himself, as explained in the verse For the Lord's portion is His people (Deut. 32:9). In effect, God serves as the heavenly minister of Israel, while all other nations are guided by ministering angels. As Rabbi Abraham Azulai",

      "title": "The Cave Of Shimon Bar Yohai",
      "content": "Near the village of Peki'in in the Galilee there is a cave known as the cave of Shimon bar Yohai. That is fire cave in which Shimon bar Yohai and his son Eleazar hid from the Romans after they passed a decree calling for his execution. Shimon bar Yohai and his son remained in that cave for thirteen years, devoting themselves to the study of the Torah. Many miracles took place while they lived in that cave. During the first night they spent there, a well of living water formed inside the cave and a large carob tree grew outside it, filled with ripe carobs, that completely hid the entrance. When Shimon bar Yohai and his son discovered the spring and the tree that had appeared overnight, they drank from the water and tasted the fruit. The water was pure and delicious and the fruit was ripe, and they knew that their faith had been rewarded and that the Holy One, blessed be He, was guarding them. And they gave thanks. After that. Rabbi Shimon and his son cast off their clothes and spent each day buried in the sand, studying the Torah. Only when it was time to pray did they put on their white garments, and in this way they preserved them through the long years of their exile. Then a day came when Elijah the Prophet arrived at the cave to study with them. Elijah revealed great mysteries to them that had never been known outside of heaven. And in the days that followed Elijah often returned, and Shimon bar Yohai wrote down those mysteries on parchment that Elijah brought them, which came from the ram that Abraham had sacrificed on Mount Moriah in place of Isaac. Now that was an enchanted parchment, for as Shimon bar Yohai wrote, it expanded to receive his words. And every letter he inscribed there burned in black fire on white. And the name of the book that he wrote down there, filled with the celestial mysteries, was the Zohar . One day, as they watched from inside the cave. Rabbi Eleazar saw a bird repeatedly escape from a hunter, and he recognized this as a sign that they were free to leave the cave, for the Emperor had died and the decree had been annulled. But before they left, they hid the book of the Zohar in that cave, for they knew that the world was not yet ready for its secrets to be revealed. There the book of the Zohar remained for many generations, until an Ishmaelite who happened to find it in the cave sold it to peddlers. Some of its pages came into the possession of a rabbi, who recognized their value at once. He went to all the peddlers in that area and found that they had used the pages of the book to wrap their spices. In this way he was able to collect all of the missing pages, and that is how the Zohar was saved and came to be handed down. Although this legend originated in a talmudic source, it became the basis for the kabbalistic legends about the talmudic sage Shimon bar Yohai, as well as for the origin of the Zohar, the central text of kabbalah. According to this legend. Bar Yohai spent 13 years in a cave, hiding from the Romans, who had condemned him. Moshe de Leon, who lived in Spain in the thirteenth century, attributed the text of the Zohar, which he claimed to have discovered, to Shimon bar Yohai, who was said to have written it during the years spent in hiding. However, modern scholars, especially Gershom Scholem, have demonstrated that the Zohar was actually the creation of Moshe de Leon, perhaps with the collaboration of his circle of kabbalists. The Zohar is a mystical commentary on the Torah, but it also contains many legends about Shimon bar Yohai and his disciples. The portrayal of Shimon bar Yohai in the Zohar became the model of the master for later sages, especially the Ari. And the Ari became the archetype of the master for later rabbis, such as Shalom Sharabi and the Ba'al Shem Tov. So an imagined portrayal of a master by Moshe de Leon led to a real life emulation of the model. For a discussion about the authorship of the Zohar, see \" A Note on the Sources/' p. 525, footnote *.",

      "title": "Light From The Temple",
      "content": "What was the source of the light that came forth when God said. Let there be light (Gen. 1:3)? Some say it shone forth from the place where the Temple in Jerusalem would one day be built, and from there it illuminated the entire world. Surrounded by that light, God completed the creation of the world. Then God saw to it that the light of the Temple was diffused to all the world, as it is said, God has shined forth (Ps. 50:2). Others say that the light was created at the site of the Temple, and had never before existed. This holy light continued to emanate even after the Temple was built upon that place. Its source was in the Holy of Holies, in which the Holy Ark stood, and it lit up the Temple and shone forth through the windows. For there were windows in the Temple, but instead of light coming into them, it went out of them. Indeed, the windows were built for this purpose, narrow on the inside and broad on the outside, in order to send forth light into the world. And the light that shone forth from the Temple ascended to the firmament, to God's Chariot, and to the Throne of Glory, and the light filled Jerusalem and the Holy Land, and all basked in its presence. That is why it is said that Jerusalem is the light of the world.",
      "commentary": "This myth about the origin of the first light derives from the verse And the earth was lit up by His Presence (Ezek. 43:2), where \"Presence\" is identified with the Temple in Jerusalem. There is a suggestion in this myth that the light pre-existed, and that the site on which the Temple was built was sacred from the time of Creation, if not before. Genesis Rabbah 3:4 states: \"The light was created from the place of the Temple.\" This has theological implications, as it suggests that God created the universe out of existing materials. See \"God's Garment of Light,\" p. 82. The question of whether God used pre-existing materials in creating the world was a highly controversial one among the ancient rabbis, who considered it an esoteric matter. Rabbi Bar Kappara took the position that the Torah reveals that God did make use of pre-existing material, while Rav compared this to building a palace on a garbage dump, and Rabbi Jose ben Haninah asserted that the suggestion that God made use of pre-existing materials such as darkness, chaos, and void (tohu and vohu) impaired God's glory. ( Genesis Rabbah 1:5). The notion that light pre-existed also is found in Isaiah 45:7: I form the light and create darkness. Here the important distinction is between \"form\" (yotzer) and \"create\" (borei), with \"form\" suggesting that the light already existed, while \"create\" refers to something that was brought into being ex nihilo. Midrash Tehillim presents a very terse version of this myth, asking where God diffused the light, with the answer that God had diffused it from the Temple. This is linked to the verse And the earth was lit up by His Presence (Ezek. 43:2) Here the phrase \"the earth was lit up\" is understood to mean the Temple. From this derives the interpretation that the light itself came from the place of the Temple. Genesis Rabbah 60:19, however, offers a different source for the light: \"Who is the light of Jerusalem? God, as it is said, Yahweh shall be your light everlasting \" (Isa. 60:19). This myth is likely of Jewish-Gnostic origin, as there was a primary Gnostic belief that light pre-existed the chaos that preceded creation. For an example of this Gnostic myth, see On the Origin of the World 2:97-98: \"Seeing that everybody says that nothing existed prior to chaos, I shall demonstrate that they are all mistaken, because they are not acquainted with the origin of chaos, nor with its root .... After the natural structure of the immortal beings had completely developed out of the infinite, a likeness then emanated and became a product resembling the primeval light.\" A related myth in B. Ta'anit 10a states that the Land of Israel was created first, and the rest of the world came afterward. This land is watered first, according to this myth, because it is watered by God Himself, and the rest of the world is watered through a messenger of God. Both myths, that of light from the Temple and that Eretz Yisrael was created first, insist on the centrality of the Land of Israel.",

There Moses saw God building the sanctuary of the Temple out of precious stones and pearls, and out of the splendor of the Shekhinah. So too did Moses see the Messiah, the son of David, standing there, as well as his own brother, Aaron. Aaron said to Moses, Do not touch me, for no one may enter here until he gives up his soul and tastes the taste of death. Otherwise the flame of the Shekhinah will consume you.\" When Moses heard Aaron's words, he fell on his face and pleaded, \"Master of the Universe, let me speak with your Messiah before I die.\" God gave His consent and said to an angel, \"Go, teach Moses my great Name so that the flame of the Shekhinah will not consume him when he sees the Messiah/' When Moses had been taught the Name, he said to the Messiah, \"Will God build a sanctuary on earth like the one He is building here in heaven?\" The Messiah replied: \"The house that God is building with His hands in heaven will exist for Israel until the end of all generations. While your father Jacob was sleeping, he saw the Temple that God will build on earth and the one being built in heaven. Jacob understood that this heavenly House would exist for Israel forever, until the end of all generations. That is what Jacob meant when he awoke from his dream of the ladder reaching to heaven and said.",
      "commentary": "This is none other than the abode of God, and that is the gateway to heaven (Gen. 28:17). And when the time comes, God will bring this heavenly Jerusalem down to earth.\" When Moses heard these words from the Messiah, he rejoiced greatly and turned his face toward God and said, \"Master of the Universe, when will You bring down this Temple that is now being built?\" God said, \"I have not disclosed this to any living being, neither to the first ones or the last. Shall I tell you?\" Moses said, \"Master of the Universe, give me a hint.\" God said, \"I will scatter the Israelites to the four comers of the earth, but one day I will bring them back to the Land of Israel.\" Moses descended from heaven contented. Then he gave his soul to God with a perfect heart and a longing soul.",

      "content": "Abraham and Isaac arrived at the place of which God had told him. Abraham built an altar there (Gen. 22:9). Some say that was the same altar on Mount Moriah where Adam made offerings, because the gate of the Garden of Eden was close by. Adam erected an altar to the Lord there, and on it he sacrificed an ox with one horn on its forehead. So too was it the same altar on which Cain and Abel made their sacrifices, and the same altar where Noah and his sons sacrificed. Others say the altar that Adam built was demolished by the waters of the Flood. Noah rebuilt it, but it was demolished in the generation of the Tower of Babel. Then Abraham built the altar there; he laid out the wood ; he bound his son Isaac ; he laid him on the altar, on top of the wood (Gen. 22:9). That was the site where in the future the Temple in Jerusalem would be built, and the place of the altar was the same as that of the Temple altar, where the High Priests made their sacrifices.",
      "commentary": "This myth presents an archetypal altar on which many of the key biblical sacrifices prior to the building of the Temple were made. It asserts that the same altar was used by Adam, Cain and Abel, Noah and his sons, and it was situated on the same holy mountain. Mount Moriah, where God directed Abraham to go to offer his son Isaac. Further, the Temple Mount, known as Mount Moriah, is believed to be set in the same place. This is an example of mythic geography, with little consideration for actual geographic location. Instead, what matters is linking together these sacrifices in order to portray the existence of this archetypal altar for sacrifices to God. Others say that Adam and Eve lived on Mount Moriah, because the gate of the Garden of Eden was close by. Adam erected an altar to the Lord there, and on it he sacrificed a remarkable ox with one horn on its forehead. So too did Adam's sons, Cain and Abel, make use of that altar.",

      "content": "God has prayed for the building of the Temple since the days of Abraham, and even before. Why should God pray for this? Because man must build the earthly Temple first, and afterward God will send the heavenly Temple to rest upon it. All of Israel, together, is responsible for rebuilding the Temple. Everyone has an equal share, and everyone is obligated to participate. Once it is built, the earthly Temple will serve as the foundation for the one that will come from the heavens. The ultimate stage of the messianic era will be the descent of the heavenly Temple, which will come to rest on the earthly one. See \"The Descent of the Heavenly Temple,\" p. 512. Before this can take place, the earthly Temple must be built, or, since the first two Temples were destroyed, rebuilt. This will prepare the necessary awakening from below that must precede the descent of the Temple from on high. According to Metzudat David, once the earthly Temple is built, God will take so much delight in it that He Himself will carve designs on the stones in order to beautify them. Thus God prays for the building of the earthly Temple so that the time may be hastened when the messianic era begins and He can lower the supernal Temple onto it. This belief serves as one of the primary motivations of fervent groups in Israel that are devoted to the building of the third Temple despite the fact that the Muslim Dome of the Rock has already been built on what is usually regarded as the site of the Temple.",

Others say that God began the creation of His world at the foundation stone, and built the world upon it. Then He created the Celestial Temple, as it is said.

      "content": "Some say that in the future God will cause the Jerusalem on high to descend from heaven fully built, and will set it on the tops of four mountains: Mount Sinai, Mount Tabor, Mount Carmel, and Mount Hermon. Then the Temple will sing aloud, and the mountains will answer the song. So too will Jerusalem serve as a beacon to all of the nations, and they will walk in her light. Thus will God announce the Redemption. Others say that a beautiful and great city, built of precious stones and pearls, will descend from heaven, resting on 3,000 towers. How will the people ascend these towers? Like clouds and winged doves, for they will become flying beings. The houses and gates of the pious will have doorposts made of precious stones. The treasuries of the Sanctuary will be open to them, for there will be love of Torah and peace among them. Still others say that Jerusalem will descend from heaven and station itself like a pillar of fire from earth to heaven. Then all who want to come to Jerusalem will see that pillar of fire and will follow its light until they reach Jerusalem. For that light will be greater than that of the sun and moon, and will make their light dim. And they will dwell in that kingdom until the End of Days, seven thousand years from the days of creation. One of the key events of the messianic era will be the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem. In this myth the problem of rebuilding the Temple is solved by having the heavenly Jerusalem— including the heavenly Temple— descend to earth and settle on the tops of four (or in some versions, three) mountains.",
      "commentary": "This myth of the descent of the heavenly Jerusalem is based on two biblical verses. One, from Isaiah, says. In the days to come the Mount of Yahweh's house shall stand firm above the mountains (Isa. 2:2). The other verse. How welcome on the mountain are the footsteps of the herald announcing happiness (Isa. 52:7), is given a mythic interpretation, where the messenger is the heavenly city of Jerusalem, here brought down to earth as a symbol of the transformation that will take place in the messianic era. This image, in itself, is quite beautiful, with the ethereal Jerusalem appearing as if in a vision, balanced on the tops of four key mountains in Jewish history. In some versions, however, it sits on the top of only the first three mountains listed, excluding Mount Hermon. This points to the different mythic meanings of the numbers three and four, both of which have key importance in Jewish lore. An extensive description of the future Temple is found at the end of the Book of Ezekiel 40-48, beginning with a vision: The hand ofYahweh came upon me , and He brought me there. He brought me , in visions of God, to the Land of Israel, and He set me down on a very high mountain (Ezek. 40: 1-2). Hai Gaon portrays Jerusalem as a pillar of fire, like the one that led the Israelites through the desert at night. That is to say, allegorically, that Jerusalem is the guiding light for the Jews, and the light it casts will be that described in Isaiah 30:26: The light of the moon shall be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of the seven days. Sefer Zerubavel describes the rebuilding of Jerusalem, with the Temple built on five mountains: Lebanon, Moriah, Tabor, Carmel, and Hermon. Here it is the Temple on top of these mountains, rather than Jerusalem itself. In 2 Baruch God tells Baruch about the heavenly Temple waiting to descend: \"It is not this building (the Temple in Jerusalem) that is in your midst now; it is that which will be revealed, with Me, that was already prepared from the moment I decided to create Paradise.\" See \"The Descent of the Heavenly Temple,\" p. 512.",

So too will God add to Jerusalem a thousand gardens, a thousand towers, a thousand fortresses, and a thousand passages. This myth of the raising up of Jerusalem is the opposite of that of \"The Descent of the Heavenly Jerusalem\" (see p. 418). The latter speaks of the Jerusalem on high being brought down to earth, and this one of the earthly Jerusalem being raised on high. The consistent factor is the supernatural qualities associated with Jerusalem. The myth of two Jerusalems, one on earth and one in heaven, is hinted at in the apocalyptic 4 Ezra: In the days to come, when the signs foretold have come to pass, the city that is now invisible will appear, and the land which is now concealed be seen (4 Ezra 7:26-27). This notion develops in the Talmud into a myth of two Jerusalems. Rabbi Yohanan said: \"Jerusalem of this world is not like Jerusalem of the World to Come. Anyone who wants to visit Jerusalem in this world can do so, but only those who are invited can ascend to Jerusalem of the World to Come\" ( B . BB 75b). At the same time, however, and in the same source, there is an alternate myth. Here, instead of bringing the heavenly Jerusalem down to earth at the time of the Redemption, it is said that God would elevate the earthly Jerusalem. Over time, the former myth of two Jerusalems became the dominant one, with the understanding that the heavenly Jerusalem would descend at the time of the Redemption.",

      "content": "The Land of Israel is the center of the world. Jerusalem is the center of the Land of Israel. The Temple is the center of Jerusalem. The Ark is the center of the Temple. The Foundation Stone stands before the Ark, and the entire world was founded upon it. The gate to heaven is there, and it is open. For God created the world in the same way a child is formed in the womb. Just as a child begins to grow from its navel, and then develops into its full form, so God began with the navel of the world, and from there expanded in all directions. Thus Jerusalem is the navel of the world, and its core is the altar of the Holy Temple, built upon the Foundation Stone, which forms the foundation of the world. On medieval maps Jerusalem is often shown as the center of the world, or, as it is often called, the navel of the world. This belief, supported by Ezekiel 5:5, derives both from the importance of Jerusalem and from the tradition of the Foundation Stone, upon which the world was built. See \"The Foundation Stone,\" p. 96. The reference to the gate of heaven derives from Jacob's dream, This is none other than the abode of God, and that is the gateway to heaven (Gen. 28:17). Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael offers an alternate explanation of how the Land of Israel and Jerusalem were selected, in which God did not create the world around them, but they were chosen by God after the world was created: \"Before the Land of Israel was chosen, all lands were suitable for divine revelation; after the Land of Israel was chosen, all other lands were eliminated. Before Jerusalem was selected, the entire Land of Israel was suitable for altars; after Jerusalem was selected, all the rest of the land was eliminated. Before the place of the Temple was selected, the whole of Jerusalem was appropriate for the manifestation of the Shekhinah; after the place of the Temple had been selected, the rest of Jerusalem was eliminated, as it is said. This is my resting-place for all time (Ps. 132:14).\"",

So God sent Isaac to comfort Jerusalem, and he fared no better than his father had done. Then God sent Jacob as he had Isaac, but Jerusalem would not be comforted. So God sent Moses on this mission, but still Jerusalem refused to be comforted. Thereupon all of the patriarchs went to God and said, \"Jerusalem will not accept comforting from any of us, so great is her grief.\" Then God said, \"It is for Me to comfort Jerusalem. Since I set her on fire, I must comfort her.\" The model for a biblical figure comforting Israel is found in Jeremiah 31:15, where Jeremiah imagines or has a vision of Rachel weeping over the exile of her children, the children of Israel. This myth also finds a parallel in \"God's Exile with Israel,\" p. 61. In that case God offered to raise any one of the patriarchs from the dead to lead Israel, but Israel refused all of them.

Since King David desired to build a Temple to God, he entreated God to show him a place for the altar. So an angel appeared to him in a vision standing over the place in Jerusalem where the altar should be located. However, the angel commanded David not to build the Temple because he had been defiled with human blood through the many years he had spent fighting wars. The angel commanded him to turn the construction over to his son, Solomo n, but directed David himself to prepare the material needed for the construction — -gold, silver, copper, stones, cypress a nd cedar wood. This David did, and when the time*camelorSolomon to construct the Tfemple, the materials he needed to build it were already in his possession. Then King Solomon called everyone together — the rich and the poor, the princes and the priests— and he said: \"People of Israel, let us build a splendid Temple in Jerusalem in honor of God. And since the Temple will be the holy place of all the people, all of the people should share in building it. Therefore you will cast lots to decide which wall you will build.\" So King Solomon prepared four lots. On one he wrote North, on another South, on the third East, and on the last West. Then he had each group choose one of them. In this way, it was decided that the princes would build the northern wall as well as the pillars and the stairs of the Temple. And the priests would build the southern wall and tend the Ark",

His fingers did the measuring, and the stones rose in place accordingly. Never did a building arise as easily as this Temple, or rather, this Temple arose as a Temple truly should. Only — on every stone (in what quarry had they originated?) was carved, with tools that must have been splendidly sharp, out of anger or to defile or to utterly destroy them, the crude scribblings of meaningless hands of children, or rather the markings of barbarous mountain dwellers, lasting an eternity that would survive the Temple. This is one of two parables Kafka wrote about the Temple. See \"Leopards in the Temple, p. 423, for the other. This one about the building of the Temple is suggestive of the folklore about King Solomon, certainly the notion that \"Everything came through him in the construction.\"",

This is not quite as apparent in \"Leopards in the Temple.

This motif is parallel to the rabbinic myth that the Temple built itself. See the preceding entry, \"The Temple Built Itself,\" p. 421.",

Kafka wrote a number of parables that closely follow biblical and midrashic models. See \"Paradise, p. 445 and \"The Coming of the Messiah,\" p. 518. Kafka also wrote parables on Abraham and Mount Sinai. Here, as is often the case, Kafka transforms the myth into a universal one, where it is no longer certain that the temple in Kafka's parable is the Temple in Jerusalem. An interesting parallel is IFA 16893, where lions enter a synagogue in Meron.",

      "content": "As long as the people of Israel fulfilled the will of God, the faces of the cherubim on the curtain covering the Holy of Holies in the JTempl e were turned toward each other like those of a loving couple, indicating God'sTove for Israel. But Whert the people^oFlsrael did not obey the will of God, the cherubim turned their faces miraculously away from each other, toward the walls. Great mystery is associated with the two cherubim that were said to be sculpted on the cover of the Ark in the Temple in Jerusalem. They were believed to be enchanted, as demonstrated in this myth, where they are said to face each other like a loving couple if Israel fulfilled God's will and to turn away if Israel did not. For more on the role of the cherubim, see \"The Ever-turning Sword of Flame,\" p. 404. The earliest reference to the cherubim is found in Genesis 3:24, where God places them at the gates of Eden. That passage does not indicate their sex, but the description of the cherubim on the Ark cover in the Holy of Holies implies that of a couple, and some sexual element is assumed. This is made very explicit in the talmudic tradition in B. Yoma 54a: \"Whenever Israel came to the Temple for the Festival, the curtain would be removed and the Cherubim were shown to them, whose bodies were intertwined with one another, and they would be addressed: 'Look! You are beloved before God as the love between man and woman.\" This almost certainly refers to the uniting of God's masculine and f eminine aspects . When there is harmony between GcftTand Israel, these aspects are irT 'narmony, but when there isn't harmony, the forces of exile predominate above and below. These notions were much further elaborated on in kabbalah, where the separation of God's masculine and feminine aspects is portrayed as the exile of the Shekhinah.",

      "content": "When God decided to destroy the Temple in Jerusalem, He first put aside the Holy Land above, the supernal city of Jerusalem, and cut it off from the sacred heavens that served as its nourishment. Seeing this, the angels wept bitterly, for it meant that the Shekhinah had been sent into exile. These are the ways of God. When He wishes to judge the world. He first passes judgment on the world above, and only then does He pass judgment on the world below. Nor was the Shekhinah the only one in heaven to suffer. Even God suffered a change from what He was before— His light no longer shone. That is because blessings exist only where male and female are together. So it was that from the day the Temple was destroyed, the heavens did not shine with their usual light. Nor will the light of the heavens be restored until the End of Days, when the Bride and Groom shall dwell together again as one. Most myths about the Temple of God in the heavenly Jerusalem emphasize its eternal nature, in stark contrast to the earthly Temple, which was destroyed. But this myth is different, claiming that God cut off the heavenly Temple from the source of its nourishment. Isaiah Tishby identifies the Holy Land above not only with the Temple, but more specifically with the Shekhinah, suggesting that this myth from the Zohar is more of a myth about the exile of the Shekhinah than about the heavenly Jerusalem. Zohar 1:182a provides a prooftext for the necessity of male and female to be together in order for blessings to exist: Male and female He created them and blessed them (Gen. 5:2). This emphasizes the heavenly parallels to the human condition, again underscoring the central kabbalistic tenet of \"as above, so below.\"",

Although this is a rabbinic myth, no later than the eighth century, the notion that the Land of Israel was under a curse parallels the later kabbalistic notion of the kelippot, the shards of the shattered vessels in the myth of the Ari to which demonic forces cling. These forces of evil cling to the shards very tightly, and are hard to dislodge. However, they will meet their final defeat in the End of Days, the messianic era.

      "title": "The Destruction Of The Temple",
      "content": "As long as the Shekhinah dwelled in the Temple, it could not be destroyed. But as the sins of Israel increased, the Shekhinah gradually withdrew from the Holy of Holies, leaving the Temple and the holy city of Jerusalem unprotected. Some say that after withdrawing from the Temple, the Shekhinah dwelt on the Mount of Olives for thirteen years before She returned to Her place on high. Jeremiah is said to have seen Her there. After Jeremiah left Jerusalem, the Angel of the Lord came down from heaven, set his feet against the walls of Jerusalem, and breached them. Then the angel cried out, \"Let the enemies come and enter the House, for the Master is no longer within. Let them despoil and destroy it. Let them go into the vineyard and cut down the vines, for the Watchman has gone away and left it.\" When the Temple was destroyed, five things were hidden that have never been seen again: the Ark, the menorah, the fires, the Holy Spirit, and the cherubim. They will remain hidden until the Temple is rebuilt. Then God will return them to their places and make Jerusalem joyous. So too, in the future, when the Temple will be raised up and renewed, its gates that are buried in the earth will all arise, every one in its place. Jewish tradition holds that the Temple could not have been destroyed without God's concurrence. Indeed, the Angel of the Lord, sent at God's behest, is the one who breaches the wall, not the Roman army. So too does the angel invite the enemies to destroy the Temple because God, the Master, is gone. Thus the understanding that God had turned His face away from His people at that time. This is confirmed in the confrontation between God and the Shekhinah , as recounted in Zohar 1 :202b-203a, where the Bride of God accuses Her spouse, God, of destroying Her home, i.e., the Temple, and sending Her children, Israel, into exile. See \"The Exile of the Shekhinah ,\" p. 57. An interesting variant to this myth is found in Eikhah Zuta and Yalkut Shim'oni, where God states that \"As long as I am in the Temple, the nations of the world cannot harm it. Therefore I shall avert My eye from it, and shall foreswear all involvement with it until the End of Days. And the enemies shall enter it and destroy it.\" According to this myth, it was at that very hour that the enemy entered the Temple court and set it aflame. Zohar 1:26b traces the destruction of the first and second Temples to Adam's sin of eating from the Tree of Knowledge. This demonstrates the link between the Fall and the destruction of the Temple in Jewish mythic consciousness. Both are regarded as cosmic catastrophes of equal importance. However, the same source in the Zohar also links the destruction of the two temples to the breaking of the two tablets that Moses brought down from Mount Sinai. It explains that because the people were under the domination of the Angel of Death, the tablets that derived from the Tree of Life broke and fell. Not all myths agree that God played an active role in the destruction of the Temple. Some sources attribute its destruction to the Yetzer ha-Ra, the Evil Inclination. B. Sukkah 52a states that the Yetzer ha-Ra set its eyes on the first Temple and destroyed it, and killed the Torah scholars who were in it. So too did the Yetzer ha-Ra set its eyes on the second Temple and destroy it, and killed the Torah scholars who were in it. In these cases the Evil Inclination plays a role similar to that of the Evil Eye, which casts an evil spell on whatever it gazes upon. Other myths attribute the desire to harm the Temple to the demons, who sought to sabotage the building of the Temple in several ways.",
      "commentary": "This is found in the frame story to The Testament of Solomon, where the demons, feeling that King Solomon and his chief builder were too powerful to bring down, instead sent the demon Ornasis to harm the son of the chief builder, hoping to harm Solomon that way.

It was put in the Kotel, the Western Wall of the Temple.

Jewish tradition recounts that the Kotel the retaining wall of the Temple Mount, was the only wall of the Temple to survive the destruction of the Temple. Here an explanation is offered for its survival— it contained one stone from Mount Sinai. Thus the holiness of that mountain, contained within a single stone, is credited for saving the one surviving wall of the Temple.",

      "content": "The Temple in Jerusalem had been set aflame, and the moment of destruction had arrived. The High Priest went up to the roof, the keys of the Temple in his hand. There he called out: \"Master of the Universe! The time has come to return these keys to You.\" Then he threw the keys high into the air, and at that instant a hand reached down from above and caught them, and brought them back into heaven. The destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem brought an era of Jewish life to an end. None of the rituals connected to the Temple could be performed any longer. Therefore this talmudic legend recounts how the High Priest returned the keys to the Temple to . God, and in a strongly anthropomorphic image, a giant hand reaches down from heaven to retrieve them. The theological implications of this legend are considerable. It presumes that heaven was both well aware of the destruction of the Temple, and that it was no accident, but was God's intention. Of course, it also is a tragic event. From this perspective, the act of the High Priest in returning the keys to heaven is one of great despair. Nevertheless, even at this tragic moment in Jewish history, the link between God and His people, Israel, remains intact in the act of God accepting the keys to the Temple. The motif of returning a precious gift to heaven is found in the talmudic tale of Rabbi Haninah ben Dosa returning the leg of a golden table to heaven (B. Tan. 24b-25a) and \"The Soul of the Ari\" in Gabriels Palace , pp. 258-259. In 2 Baruch the High Priest casts the temple vessels to the earth, which opens, swallowing them up.",

Abraham replied, \"I have come concerning the fate of my children.\" God said, \"Your children sinned and have been sent into exile.\" \"Perhaps,\" said Abraham, \"they only sinned in error.\" God answered, \" She has wrought lewdness \" (Jer. 11:15). Abraham said, \"Perhaps only a few sinned?\" \" With many \" (Jer. 11:15), came the reply. \"Still,\" Abraham pleaded, \"You should have remembered the covenant of the circumcision.\" God replied, \" The sacral flesh has passed from you \" (Jer. 11:15). \"In that case,\" said Abraham, \"perhaps if You had waited for them, they would have repented.\" God replied, \" For you exult while performing your evil deedsl\" (Jer. 11:15). Then Abraham put his hands on his head and wept bitterly and cried, \"Perhaps, heaven forbid, there is no hope for them.\" Then a heavenly voice came forth and said, \" The Lord named you verdant olive tree, fair, with choice fruit (Jer. 11:16). As the olive tree produces its best only at the very end, so Israel will flourish at the end of time.\" Here Abraham confronts God over the destruction of the Temple and the exile of the children of Israel, and proceeds to bargain with God as he did over the fate of Sodom (Gen. 18:22-33). God's replies are taken from Jeremiah 11:15-16. Although God does not reverse His decree against the Jews, a heavenly voice holds out the promise that in the end Israel will flourish.

Yet many mothers and sons have been killed. Why are You silent?\" Here Moses confronts first the sun — the earliest primitive symbol of God — and then God Himself over their failure to prevent the destruction of the Temple. There is substantial anger revealed, which, of course, is actually the anger of the rabbis, the authors of these myths. Abraham is not afraid to question or bargain with God, as was demonstrated in the case of Sodom (Gen. 18:22-33). But Moses has such an intimate relationship with God, and such an intense interest in the fate of his people, Israel, that he can even confront God as he did in Exodus 32:9-14, and as he does here.",

      "content": "Now the serpent was the shrewdest of all the wild beasts that the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, \"Did God really say, 'You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?'\" The woman replied to the serpent, \"We may eat of the fruit of the other trees of the garden. It is only about fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that God said, 'You shall not eat of it or touch it, lest you die.'\" And the serpent said to the woman, \"You are not going to die, but God knows that as soon as you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like divine beings who know good and bad.\" When the woman saw that the tree was good for eating and a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable as a source of wisdom, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave some to her husband, and he ate. Then the eyes of both of them were opened and they perceived that they were naked; and they sewed together fig leaves and made themselves loincloths. They heard the sound of the Lord God moving about in the garden at the breezy time of day; and the man and his wife hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden. The Lord God called out to the man and said to him, \"Where are you?\" He replied, \"I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.\" Then He asked, \"Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat of the tree from which I had forbidden you to eat?\" The man said, \"The woman You put at my side — she gave me of the tree, and I ate.\" And the Lord God said to the woman, \"What is this you have done!\" The woman replied, \"The serpent duped me, and I ate.\" Then the Lord God said to the serpent, \"Because you did this, more cursed shall you be than all the cattle and all the wild beasts: On your belly shall you crawl and dirt shall you eat all the days of your life. I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; they shall strike at your head, and you shall strike at their heel.\" And to the woman He said, \"I will make most severe your pangs in childbearing; in pain shall you bear children. Yet your urge shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.\" To Adam He said, \"Because you did as your wife said and ate of the tree about which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed be the ground because of you; by toil shall you eat of it all the days of your life: thorns and thistles shall it sprout for you. But your food shall be the grasses of the field; by the sweat of your brow shall you get bread to eat, until you return to the ground — for from it you were taken. For dust you are, and to dust you shall return.\" The man named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all the living. And the Lord God made garments of skins for Adam and his wife, and clothed them. And the Lord God said, \"Now that the man has become like one of us, knowing good and bad, what if he should stretch out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever!\" So the Lord God banished him from the garden of Eden, to till the soil from which he was taken. He drove the man out, and stationed east of the Garden of Eden the cherubim and the fiery ever-turning sword, to guard the way to the tree of life. Along with the story of Creation in Genesis, this is probably the most famous biblical myth of all. Not only is it the first of the divine tests, but it provides an explanation for mortality and a justification for patriarchy. While Judaism does not include original sin among the consequences of Adam's disobedience, the failure of Adam and Eve to heed God's warning not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge is regarded in Jewish tradition as a cosmic catastrophe, equal to the Shattering of the Vessels in the myth of the Ari, or to the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. Above all, the story of the exile from Eden is a story of sin and punishment, and establishes a negative pattern in the relationship of God and His human creations. At the same time, the story can be read as an allegory of innocence lost, where Adam and Eve are like children while they live in the Garden of Eden, and their expulsion from Eden, which takes place at the time of their loss of sexual innocence, represents the emergence into adulthood. Some sources describe other consequences of the Fall that are not found in Genesis. Just as Adam and Eve suffered great losses and punishments from the sin of the Fall, so the animals lost their language. For, according to Josephus, all living things in the Garden of Eden spoke the same language ( Antiquities 1:41), and The Book of Jubilees repeats this tradition, adding that \"on the day when Adam went out of the Garden of Eden . . . the mouths of all the beasts and cattle and birds and whatever walked or moved was stopped from speaking\" (Jubilees 3:27-28). There is an indication that even the world of vegetation was affected. According to 3 Baruch, God cursed the tree of sinful desire that the evil angel Satanel had planted, for that tree was the cause of the Fall (3 Baruch, Slavonic, 4:8). This refers to the Tree of Knowledge, here linked to carnal knowledge. An intriguing parallel to this myth of eating the forbidden fruit is that of Pandora in Greek myth, who set free the evil spirits locked up in a jar (not a box) and released evil into the world. The jar contained all the Spites that plague mankind: Old Age, Labor, Sickness, Insanity, Vice, and Passion, and as they flew out in a cloud they stung Epimetheus, Pandora's husband, and Pandora all over her body. See Graves, The Greek Myths 39j, 39.8. See also Hesiod's Works and Days 42-105, and Theogony 565-619.",

But Adam told Eve, \"God has said, 'You shall not eat of it or touch it, lest you die'\" (Gen. 3:3). At that time the serpent said to himself, \"Perhaps I cannot convince Adam, who heard the words of God for himself. So I will seek out Eve.\" The serpent found Eve in the garden and said, \"Is it true that God has commanded you not to eat of any fruit in the garden?\" Eve replied, \"No, there is only one tree in the midst of the garden forbidden to us. We are not allowed to eat of its fruit or even to touch it, for on that day we shall die.\" The serpent laughed when he heard this, and said, \"God has only said this out of jealousy, for He knows that if you eat of the fruit of that tree, your eyes will be opened, and you will know how to create a world just as He did.\" Then the serpent went to the tree in the midst of the garden and shook it, so that some of the fruit fell to the ground. \"See, I have touched the tree and I have not died. You, too, can touch it without dying.\" When Eve saw the serpent touch the tree and not die, she picked up one of the fruits that had fallen and, seeing that it was beautiful and desirable, she tasted it. But no sooner had she taken a single bite, than her teeth were set on edge, and she saw the Angel of Death standing before her, with his sword drawn. Then Eve said to herself, \"Now that I have eaten of this fruit, I will die, and Adam, who has not touched it, will live forever, and God will couple him with another woman. It is better that we die together.\"",

      "content": "When God drove Adam out of the Garden of Eden, He gave Adam a get, a bill of divorce, as it is said. He drove the man out (Gen. 3:24). After that, they went their separate ways. God withdrew from His earthly domicile and dwelt on high, and Adam struggled to bring forth food from the earth. Here God's sending Adam into exile is interpreted to mean that God divorced Himself of Adam, and gave Adam a get , a bill of divorce. A woman receives a get at the conclusion of the divorce proceedings. Then, just as a divorced couple go their separate ways, God separated Himself further from Adam by ascending on high. The biblical verse usually translated as He drove Adam out is here understood to mean instead that God separated Himself from Adam, and formalized their separation by giving Adam a get.",
      "commentary": "This myth reads like a metaphor that has become literal. After all, God and Adam were not married. But in the view of the rabbis, the separation between them was as final as a divorce. Thus the concept of a get , a bill of divorce, is expanded here to include the kind of contractual relationship found between God and Adam. According to that contract, Adam was permitted to live in the garden, as long as he did not eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. This myth also conveys the gulf of separation created between God and Adam at the time of the exile from Eden. Other rabbinic texts also portray the Fall as a major event in the history of the universe, a cosmic catastrophe. Both are intended to convey the radical transformation of the nature of existence after this cosmos-shaking event. In fact, it is precisely parallel to two other cosmic catastrophes: the Shattering of the Vessels in the myth of the Ari and the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. The majority of rabbinic references to the events of the Fall single out Adam and do not mention Eve. While this may be a form of shorthand, it also leads to the kind of pairing of God and Adam found here. While this myth describes the bill of divorce between God and Adam, \"The Wedding of God and Israel,\" p. 305, describes the Torah as a ketubah, a wedding contract, between God and His people.",

      "content": "While Adam lived in the Garden of Eden, he could have anything he wanted, with, of course, one exception— the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. So when Adam sinned and it was necessary for God to expel him from the garden, God was reluctant to drive him out. Instead God gave Adam a good meal, with the finest foods and wines, and God said, \"You know, there is a world outside this garden. Don't you want to explore it?\" Adam didn't really want to go, but God said, \"You can take anything you like with you, whatever you desire, but you must go.\" Then God showed him all the treasures and hidden things in the garden, and Adam looked at everything, gardens and orchards, animals of every kind, treasures of gold and silver, and many kinds of precious stones, but Adam didn't find anything he wanted to take with him. Then he arrived at a treasure of diamonds. The diamonds were exceptionally beautiful and shone as brightly as the sun, and Adam chose one of the largest ones. Holding that diamond in his hand, Adam went in the direction of the gates of Eden, with an angel accompanying him. He passed through the gates, and when he looked behind him he saw the cherubim with the flaming sword and he realized he could not go back. For a moment he was sorry, then he continued on his way until he reached a river.",
      "commentary": "While he was standing there looking at it, the angel pushed him from behind, and the diamond fell from his hand into the river. Adam cried out to the angel, \"Why did you do that?\" And the angel said, \"Go down to the river and find your diamond.\" So Adam went down to the river and saw thousands and thousands of diamonds reflected in the water and he couldn't recognize which one was his. Then the angel said, \"Do you think that you were the first one who was expelled from the Garden of Eden and took a diamond with you? Thousands and thousands did as you did, and their diamonds fill the river, as you can see.\" This unusual folktale may be based on the midrashic tradition about the Tzohar , the jewel said to have been given to Adam when he was expelled from the Garden of Eden. However, this story takes the motif of the diamond in a different direction. Here Adam loses the diamond in a river after being pushed by an angel, and discovers that the river is full of diamonds as precious as his own. The angel reveals that he was not the first to be expelled from Eden and take a diamond with him. While there is an extensive rabbinic tradition that God created prior worlds before this one, and destroyed them, the notion that God created human beings before Adam, who also sinned and were expelled from the Garden of Eden, is entirely original. This story demonstrates the rich Jewish oral tradition, where variations of traditional tales evolve in unexpected ways.",

      "content": "When Adam and Eve were first created, they were clothed, body and soul, with garments of light. Some say those garments of light were made entirely of clouds of glory. Others say they were made of holy luminous letters that God had given them, which shed radiance like a torch, broad at the bottom and narrow at the top. After Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, the garments of light were replaced by garments of skins, as it is said. And the Lord God made garments of skins for Adam and his wife , and clothed them (Gen. 3:21). It is said that these garments were created during twilight on the sixth day of Creation, just before the first Sabbath. Some say that they consisted of a hornlike substance, smooth as a fingernail and as beautiful as a jewel, while others say that they were made of goats 7 skin or the wool of camels. Still others insist that they were made of the hide of the serpent who led them astray in the Garden of Eden. Adam handed down the garments to Seth, and Seth to Methuselah, and Methuselah to Noah, who took them with him on the ark. And when they left the ark. Ham, the son of Noah, bequeathed them to Nimrod, although others say that Nimrod stole them. When Nimrod wore Adam's garments, his outward appearance was that of Adam, and the creatures were humbled before him and would bow down, thinking he was their king. The garments came into the possession of Esau when he defeated Nimrod, and it was this garment that Jacob wore when he went to his father, Isaac. For that day Esau had not put them on, so that they remained in the house. Rebecca then took the best clothes of her older son Esau , which were there in the house , and had her younger son Jacob put them on (Gen. 27:15). Isaac smelled the smell of Esau's garments, and therefore he blessed Jacob.",
      "commentary": "Some say that the repentance of Adam and Eve earned a different set of garments for them, garments of light. At the End of Days, God will dress the Messiah in such a garment, which will shine from one end of the world to the other. And the Jews will draw upon its light and say to the Messiah, \"Blessed is the hour in which the Messiah was created.\" This is an example of what might be called a \"chain midrash,\" because it links together the chain of the generations, from Adam until the Messiah. Other similar midrashic traditions are found about the staff of Moses, the book that the angel Raziel is said to have given Adam, and the glowing stone known as the Tzohar. Sometimes there are contradictory lines of descent, as in the case of Adam's garment. According to one account in Midrash Tanhuma, the garment was diverted into the hands of the evil king Nimrod, while in an opposing account, it was transferred from Noah to Shem to Abraham, who passed it down to Isaac. Isaac is said to have given it to Esau, his firstborn, but Esau entrusted it to his mother, Rebecca, when he saw his own wives practiced idolatry. And, as is reported in the biblical account, Rebecca took the beloved garments of her son Esau and gave them to Jacob, at the time he received the stolen blessing. According to Sefer ha-Zikhronot, the garments of Adam and Eve were among eight things created on the first day of Creation. Other sources describe them as being created at twilight on the sixth day of Creation. As is apparent, (here were alternate explanations about the nature of the garments of Adam and Eve. Genesis 3:21 seems to clearly state that they were made of the skins of animals, while in the midrash they are also described as consisting of a hornlike substance. The notion that their original garments were made of light derives from the word or, which when spelled with an aleph means \"light,\" while when spelled with an uyin means \"skin\" as well as \"leather.\" It is spelled with an ayin in Genesis 3:21, but Genesis Rabbah 20:12 states that in the Torah scroll of Rabbi Meir, the or in the biblical verse was written with an aleph. Zohar 2:229b explains that they were originally garments of light, not of skin, for when Adam was about to enter the Garden of Eden for the first time, God dressed him in garments of light, of the sort used by the angels in paradise. Indeed, the light of Adam's garments was more elevated than their own. Had he not been wearing those garments, Adam could not have entered the garden. And when he was driven out of Eden, he required different garments, so the Lord made garments of skins for Adam and his wife, and clothed them (Gen. 3:21). A variant of this myth has Noah's son, Shem, giving the garments to Abraham, who wears them when he takes Isaac to Mount Moriah to be sacrificed. Later they were inherited by Isaac, who gave them to his firstborn son, Esau. These were the garments Jacob put on when he pretended to be Esau in order to receive his father's blessing. Thus when Jacob entered the room, Isaac smelled the fragrance that he had smelled when he was tied upon the altar. Rabbi Tzadok ha-Kohen of Lublin (1823-1900) proposes that the sin of Adam and Eve, followed by their repentance, brought them to a more exalted state than before the sin, symbolized by their receiving new garments, replacing the garments of skin with garments of light. This is a surprising view of the role of sin and repentance in stimulating spiritual growth. Rabbi Yosef Hayim of Baghdad, known as Ben Ish Hai, asserts in Ben Yehoyada that Torah study has the power to reverse the process, changing garments of skins back into garments of ligh t",

Nevertheless, after considering that they were the work of His hands, God said, \"These humans have life, and so do the other creatures. These have breath and those have breath. These have a desire for food and drink and those have a desire for food and drink. Humans must be at least as important as the beasts and creeping things I created upon the earth.\" At once God felt some measure of contentment and resolved not to annihilate humankind.",

      "content": "No sooner did Adam taste the forbidden fruit than the angel Gabriel blew a trumpet and summoned all the angels. When Adam and Eve heard the trumpet, they knew that God was about to come into the Garden to judge them. Then God set out on His Chariot driven by cherubs, with angels praising Him. Adam and Eve were afraid, and hid. As soon as God reached the Garden, all the plants of the Garden flowered. God set up His throne close to the Tree of Life. Then God summoned Adam and said, \"Adam, do you think you can hide from Me? Can the building hide from its builder?\" Adam replied, \"Lord, I was afraid, for I am naked and ashamed.\" And God pronounced the punishments of the man and the woman and the serpent, and God commanded that the man and woman be expelled from the Garden. Then Adam begged God to let him eat of the Tree of Life before he left the Garden. But God said, \"You cannot take of it in your lifetime.\" Then the angels began to expel him, but Adam began to cry. \"I beseech you,\" he pleaded,\" let me take incense with me from the Garden, so that I may offer sweet incense to God. Then perhaps God will hearken to me.\" The angels let him be, and Adam took sweet incense with him, iris and balsam, and he and Eve went forth from the Garden. Just before God confronts Adam and Eve with their sin. Genesis 3:8 states, They heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the Garden toward the cool of the day. This myth, from the Armenian version of Vita Adae et Evae known as Penitence of Adam, describes God's descent from heaven and His arrival in the Garden of Eden in His Chariot, the Merkavah, driven by cherubs. It explains how God traveled from heaven to the Garden of Eden. This descent of God reflects the themes of Merkavah literature, and should be considered an example of it.",

      "title": "The Land Of Eretz",
      "content": "When Adam left the Garden of Eden, he came to the land of Eretz, a place of darkness and desolation, where sunlight is never seen. On entering there, Adam was gripped by great fear. No matter how far Adam went in any direction, he encountered the flame of the ever-turning sword that blazed on all sides of Eretz. Only when the Sabbath ended and Adam had thoughts of repentance, did God take him out of Eretz and bring him to the Land of Adamah, where he found peace at last. The Land of Eretz is described here as a place of desolation, where Adam faced the consequences of his sin and experienced the most intense grief. Note that no mention of Eve is made, although the Genesis narrative indicates that Adam and Eve remained together. This strongly suggests that Eretz is an allegorical land, representing the kind of grief that precedes repentance. The myth also indicates that having been expelled from Eden, Adam experiences panic and fright, as the boundaries of his formerly peaceful existence vanish, replaced by fearful unknowns. Indeed, melancholy and fear are part of his now-fallen condition. At the same time, rabbinic commentaries suggest that he had a great deal to regret. He bitterly regretted his sin and expulsion from Eden. He especially mourned over having brought death into the world, for now he and all his descendants had become mortal. Once he repents, however, Adam is brought to the allegorical land of Adamah, and there, at last, he experiences peace. One version of this myth, from Zohar Hadash, states that after Adam had repented by entering the waters of the river Gihon up to his neck, God brought him to the land of Adamah, thus indicating God's forgiveness.",
      "commentary": "This myth raises the question of why Eretz (land) was selected to represent a place of suffering, while Adama (ground) represents a place of inner peace. The answer derives from the use of these terms in the Genesis narrative about Adam and about Cain. So the Lord God banished him from the garden of Eden , to till the soil (adamah ) from which he was taken (Gen. 3:23). This suggests a compatibility between Adam the man and the Land of Adama, because Adam was created from the dust of the earth, a link that is underscored by their similar names. Eretz, by contrast, appears in Genesis 4:12 as a place where Cain is condemned to wander. The presence of the ever-turning fiery sword, echoing Genesis 3:24, illustrates both that Adam is trapped in the land of Eretz, and, at the same time, that Eretz is somehow connected to Eden, from which he has been expelled. Thus the ever-turning fiery sword symbolizes all the limitations that have developed in Adam's life, which have left him virtually trapped both in a desolate land and in his own bitter remorse.",

We were forbidden to eat of its fruit. \"Now God gave a part of Paradise to me and a part to your mother.

The truth is that you were brought into being to rule over everything. Make haste and eat before God creates other worlds that will dominate you.\" And Eve saw how plausible were the words of the serpent, and she tasted the fruit. This midrash adds significantly to the biblical version in having the serpent suggest to Eve that God Himself gained His powers after eating from die Tree of Knowledge. While the serpent's original comments promised Eve knowledge, they did not imply that God obtained His knowledge in this way. But the rabbis, reading between the lines, saw a hint of such a meaning in the serpent's comments and made this hint explicit. To do so is to belittle God's unique powers, and it turns the serpent into a heretic. Thus this midrash may be viewed as aimed not only at the serpent, but at those with Gnostic views who failed to acknowledge God's unique powers as Creator of the world.",

I will tell you something that will serve you well.\" The serpent came to him and Satan said, \"You are said to be wiser than all the other animals. None is your equal in cunning. That is why I have come to see you.\" Now all the wild beasts, including the serpent, came to worship Adam every morning. One morning Satan went with them and said to the serpent, \"Why do you worship Adam? You came into being before he did. He should worship you. Come, rise up.

Eve knelt down by the wall and listened to his prayers. When she looked at him, she saw the likeness of an angel, but when she looked at him again, he was not to be seen. Then Satan called upon the serpent to be his mouthpiece, and the serpent came to Eve and said, \"Are you Eve?\" \"Yes I am.\" \"What do you do in the Garden?\" \"God put us here to guard the Garden.\" \"And do you eat of the trees in the Garden?\" \"Yes,\" said Eve. \"We eat of all of them except for one tree in the very middle. God commanded us not to eat of it, lest we die.\" \"No, you will not die,\" Satan said. \"But when you eat of its fruit your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil. God deceived you when He said not to eat of it. Look at the glory that surrounds the tree.\" And when Eve looked up and saw the great glory surrounding it, she said, \"The tree is pleasing to my sight, but I am afraid. If you are not afraid, bring me the fruit and I will eat it, so I may know if your words are true or not.\" Then Satan made Eve swear an oath that if she ate of the fruit of the tree, she would share it with Adam. Then the serpent brought her to the tree and lowered the branches of the tree to the earth. As he held them down. Eve plucked some of the fruit and ate it.

      "commentary": "this myth the serpent serves as the mouthpiece of Satan. This version changes quite a few details in the biblical account, including some negotiation between Eve and the serpent about the conditions under which she would eat the fruit. Eve is afraid to pick the fruit and asks the serpent to do it for her. Instead, the serpent lowers the tree to the earth, making it easy for her to pick the fruit, which she does. Eve's reluctance is also found in the midrash, in which she first bites only the skin of the fruit, and when nothing happens, eats the rest of the fruit. ( Zekhor Hamor on Gen. 3:6.) Note that the oath that Satan forces Eve to make would be the first oath, and it is made to Satan rather than to God.",

Adam knew the Torah, and he transmitted it to his son, Seth, and it was later transmitted to Enoch. Adam also was the first High Priest, and when he offered a sacrifice, he wore the garments of the High Priest. And when he died, they passed to Seth, and from Seth they passed to Methuselah. Seth was bom circumcised, and he became a virtuous man, of excellent character, whose children imitated his virtues. That is why it is said about Seth that whatever he does prospers (Ps. 1:3). From Seth descended all of the generations of the righteous, while from Cain descended all the generations of the wicked. For seven generations the children of Seth inhabited the same country without dissension, without any misfortunes falling upon them till they died. They gained a great deal of wisdom about the heavenly bodies. Now Adam had predicted that the world was to be destroyed once by fire and another time by water. And so that their discoveries might not be lost before they were sufficiently known, the descendants of Seth made two pillars, one of brick and the other of stone. And they inscribed their discoveries on them both, so that if one or the other should be destroyed by flood or fire, the other might remain and reveal their discoveries to humankind. And God commanded two angels to guard these inscriptions so that they might not be destroyed until the final age.",

The myths about Seth recount how angels would rescue the seed of Seth at the time of the Flood and hide his descendants in a secret place. For more about the evil descendants of Cain, see \"The Seed of Cain,\" p. 448. Being born circumcised, as is recounted here of Seth, is a sign of greatness and purity.

The sexual sins listed here, as well as the use of black magic, and the lust for possessions are offered to justify God's decision to destroy the generation of the Flood. Although the centaur, half man, half horse, is a figure out of Greek mythology, here its existence is explained as the product of human intercourse with beasts and as further evidence of the kind of sin that led God to the decision to destroy all life on earth except for Noah and his family and the animals on the ark.",

      "content": "Now the man knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, \"I have gained a male child with the help of the Lord.\" She then bore his brother Abel. Abel became a keeper of sheep, and Cain became a tiller of the soil. In the course of time, Cain brought an offering to the Lord from the fruit of the soil; and Abel, for his part, brought the choicest of the firstlings of his flock. The Lord paid heed to Abel and his offering, but to Cain and his offering He paid no heed. Cain was much distressed and his face fell. And the Lord said to Cain, \"Why are you distressed, and why is your face fallen? Surely, if you do right, there is uplift. But if you do not do right sin couches at the door; its urge is toward you, yet you can be its master.\" Cain said to his brother Abel, \"Come, let us go out into the field,\" and when they were in the field, Cain set upon his brother Abel and killed him. The Lord said to Cain, \"Where is your brother Abel?\" And he said, \"1 do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?\" Then He said. What have you done? Hark, your brother's blood cries out to Me from the ground! Therefore, you shall be more cursed than the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother s blood from your hand. If you till the soil, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. You shall become a ceaseless wanderer on earth.\" Cain said to the Lord, My punishment is too great to bear! Since You have banished me this day from the soil, and I must avoid Your presence and become a restless wanderer on earth— anyone who meets me may kill me!\" The Lord said to him, \"I promise, if anyone kills Cain, sevenfold vengeance shall be taken on him.\" And the Lord put a mark on Cain, lest anyone who met him should kill him. Cain left the presence of the Lord and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden. The theme of competing brothers is also found in the biblical accounts of Isaac and Ishmael, Jacob and Esau, and Joseph and his brothers. No reason is given for God's preference of Abel's offering over Cain's. Also, no reason is given for Cain s attack on Abel. However, both of these Questions are answered in detail in the Midrash, where Abel's offering was preferred because it consisted of the choicest of his flock, and the struggle between the brothers is blamed on a struggle over a woman. The ultimate fate of Cain is also not mentioned, although rabbinic tradition provides four different versions of Cain's death. See \"The Death of Cain,\" p. 451. Parallel accounts of two brothers are found in the literature of the ancient Near East. The Egyptian stories of Anubis and Bata concern two brothers who work as farmers but become enemies after Anubis's wife falsely accuses Bata of propositioning her. Anubis, in his fury, goes to kill Bata with a spear, but the god Ra creates a lake full of crogodiles to protect Bata from his older brother. Eventually the two brothers reconcile, and each, in turn, becomes pharaoh. See Old Testament Parallels: Laws and Stories from the Ancient Near East by Victor H. Matthews and Don C. Benjamin, pp. 61-65.",

      "title": "How Cain Was Conceived",
      "content": "Samael was the great prince in heaven. After God created the world, Samael took his band of followers and descended and saw the creatures that God had created. Among them he found none so skilled to do evil as the serpent, as it is said. Now the serpent was the shrewdest of all the wild beasts (Gen. 3:1). Its appearance was something like that of a camel, and Samael mounted and rode upon it. Riding on the serpent, the angel Samael came to Eve in the night and seduced her, and she conceived Cain. Later, while Eve was pregnant by the angel, Adam came to her, and she conceived Abel. Others say it was the serpent himself who seduced Eve, for after he saw Adam and Eve coupling, the serpent conceived a passion for her. He even imagined killing Adam and marrying Eve. So he came to Eve when she was alone and possessed her and infused her with lust. That is how the serpent fathered Cain, who was later to slay his own brother. And that is how Eve was infected with his impurity. As a result, all of Israel was impure from that time until the Torah was given on Mount Sinai. Only then did Israel's impurity cease. When Cain was born, Adam knew at once that he was not of his seed, for he was not after his likeness, nor after his image. Instead, Cain's appearance was that of a heavenly being. And when Eve saw that his appearance was not of this world, she said, I have gained a male child with the help ofYahweh (Gen. 4:1). It was not until the birth of Seth that Adam had a son who was in his own likeness and image. From Seth arose all of the generations of the righteous, while all the generations that descended from the seed of Cain are wicked, until this very day.",
      "commentary": "This myth is a response to the enigmatic verse in which Eve says, I have gotten a man with the aid of Yahweh (Gen. 4:1). Targum Pseudo-Yonathan translates this verse as \"I have acquired a man, the angel of the Lord.\" One reading of this verse in the Talmud (B. Shah. 146a) suggests that Eve had intercourse with the serpent: \"When the serpent consorted with Eve, he cast impurity into her.\" This interpretation is echoed in the Zohar: \"From the impurity with which the serpent infected Eve emerged Cain.\" Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer builds on the talmudic interpretation, but changes it in an essential way. Here the true father of Cain is the angel Samael, who came to Eve riding on the serpent. Indeed, in this passage the angel and serpent are closely linked, creating a satanic figure and suggesting that Eve had intercourse with the serpent, a powerful phallic symbol. In Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer , the Torah upbraids Samael as he rides upon the serpent like a camel: \"The Torah began to cry aloud, saying, 'Why, O Samael, now that the world is created, is it time to rebel against God? Is this the time to lift yourself on high? God will laugh at the horse and its rider/\" This establishes the role of the Torah as the defender of the human race against the evil intentions of Samael. Zohar 1:36b explains that two came upon Eve, the serpent and Adam, and that she became pregnant from both of them, and bore two sons. The son of the serpent is, of course, Cain. In order to explain why Cain was evil and Abel was good, Zohar 1:54a explains that Cain was conceived from the side of unholiness and Abel from the side of holiness. As a result, Abel was in the likeness of God's image, as stated in the verse And God created man in His image (Gen. 1:27). But Cain was of the likeness of the nether image. Just what this is isn't clear, although one commentary, Ziv ha-Zohar, identifies the nether image as that of an ape. Because Cain was from the side of the Angel of Death (another possible explanation of the \"nether image\"), he killed his brother. The idea that Eve was infected by the impurity of the serpent when she had intercourse with it attempts to portray women as not only impure, but also untrustworthy. It is part of an extensive antifeminine bias found in some rabbinic texts. However, in other texts. Eve is portrayed in a very favorable manner. She is regarded as the mother of all generations, and she is called a life-giver, who nursed the whole world (B. AZ 43a). The serpent of Genesis becomes transformed in kabbalah into a principle of evil, the primal serpent who makes its home in the darkness of the Sitra Ahra, the Other Side. It is a serpent by the road , a viper by the path (Gen. 49:17). It comes down from above, swims across bitter waters, and descends in order to deceive, lying in wait to ambush mankind with sins. The Sitra Ahra is the realm of evil. It is said to be ruled by Samael and Lilith. The primal or primordial serpent is an archetype of evil, based upon the serpent in the Garden of Eden. In this realm it functions as a force of evil, an exaggerated version of the Yetzer ha-Ra, the Evil Impulse in every person. Here this impulse is understood to be an underlying principle in the concept of an evil realm. Evil, however, flourishes only in the absence of good. The Zohar describes this serpent as \"eternal death, on the left side, that enters into a man's innermost secret parts\" (Zohar 2:52a). See the closely related myth, \"The Seed of Cain,\" p. 448. For a Hasidic tale about the primal serpent, see \"Reb Shmelke's Whip\" in Gabriel's Palace, p. 226.",

      "content": "Adam was not Cain's father. Cain was conceived by Samael riding the serpent in the Garden of Eden. The serpent came to Eve at night and had intercourse with her, and Cain was bom from this union. Thus Cain was not of Adam's seed, nor after his likeness, nor after his image. Adam did not have a son in his own image and likeness until Seth was bom. After Cain became a restless wanderer (Gen. 4:14), he settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden (Gen. 4:16). He married and Cain knew his wife , and she conceived (Gen. 4:17). Some say that the offspring of Cain went extinct after seven generations, for God chose to visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children (Exod. 34:7). Others say that the seed of Cain still walk the earth. For from Seth arose and were descended all the generations of the righteous, and from Cain arose and were descended all the generations of the wicked, who rebelled and sinned against heaven. One and all the seed of Cain are descended from the serpent, and they are the enemies of Israel — Amalek, Edom and Rome. Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer says of the conception of Cain, \"Samael riding on the serpent came to Eve and she conceived.\" This creates two lines of people, those descended from the seed of Adam and his son, Seth, and those descended from the seed of Cain. See \"How Cain was Conceived,\" p. 447.",
      "commentary": "According to B. Shabbat, Eve had sexual relations with the serpent in the Garden of Eden and the snake deposited a pollution in Eve that entered into her children and her children's children. However, this explanation does not distinguish between the seed of Seth and the seed of Cain. When Israel accepted the Torah at Mount Sinai, the seed of Seth was purified of the pollution the snake had deposited in Eve and that had entered her children's children. The same cannot be said of the seed of Cain. This myth about Cain's conception and the seed of Cain derives, in part, from Genesis 5:3: When Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years, he begot a son in his likeness after his image, and he named him Seth. This is taken to imply that Cain was not Adam's son. The Zohar (1:55a) explains that neither Cain nor Abel was born in Adam's likeness, based on the verse She conceived and bore Cain, saying/1 have gained a male child with the help ofYahweh (Gen. 4:1). The Zohar takes this to mean that both Cain and Abel stemmed chiefly from Eve, rather than Adam. Seth, by contrast, bore Adam's image. &lt;AIN AND ABEL 449 The tradition that there are two lines of descent, from the seed of Adam and from the seed of Cain, is found in Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer and other sources. Some attribute this tradition to Rabbi Ishmael and other to Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai. This midrash offers an explanation for the existence of Israel's enemies, explaining that they were all descended from the seed of Cain. During and after the Holocaust, the Nazis were sometimes identified as the \"seed of Cain.\"",

      "content": "Eve was the first woman ever to give birth. When the time came, neither Adam nor Eve knew what to expect, and they were very afraid. Adam wept and prayed to God on her behalf. All at once two angels and two powers descended from heaven, and stood before Eve. The powers said to her, \"Eve, you are blessed. Adam's prayers are mighty, and through him God's help has come to you.\" Then the angel said, \"Prepare yourself. I will be the midwife for you.\" Before long Eve gave birth to Cain. The color of his body was like the color of the stars. No sooner did the newborn child fall into the hands of the angel who served as a midwife than he leaped up and plucked the grass that grew near his mother's hut. After that nothing would ever grow there, and anyone who passed by that place became infertile. And the angel said to him, \" You shall become a ceaseless wanderer on earth (Gen. 4:12). Your legacy will be one of adultery and bitterness.\" And so it came to pass.",
      "commentary": "This is an origin tale, an account of the first birth, that of Cain, who became a prototype for evil. In the biblical account, Cain slays Abel for no apparent reason, but there are several midrashic explanations, such as a fight over one of their twin sisters, or over their property rights— Cain claimed rights to all the land and Abel to all the air. Cain told Abel to get off of his land. Abel told Cain to stop breathing his air. This version of the birth of Cain also adds many foreboding elements that suggest that Cain was not a normal child but some kind of supernatural being. \"The color of his body was like the color of the stars\" — this seems to suggest he was glowing, an abnormal condition. Further, the newborn infant jumps out of the angel's hands and his first act is a destructive one — he pulls out the grass around his mother's hut, which never grows back. Here Cain is painted as evil from the very beginning, and this is confirmed by the angel who prophesies Cain's fate.",

      "content": "Where did the wives of Cain and Abel come from? On the day that Adam and Eve were created, on that very day they coupled, and on that very day they produced offspring. It is said that two entered the bed and seven left it, for Cain was bom with a twin sister, and Abel was bom with two sisters. Cain married Abel's twin, and Abel married Cain's. But they could not agree on the fate of Abel's second twin. Indeed, it is said that she was the subject of the dispute between the two brothers, out of which Cain slew his brother Abel, and the voices of the blood of the families who were destined to issue forth from Abel cried out before God. Since Genesis does not explain what it was that Cain and Abel fought over, there are many myths that speculate about it. One of the most common explanations is that they were fighting over a woman. In this version, she is identified as Abel's second twin. In other versions, such as Genesis Rabbah 22:7, the woman they fought over is identified as the first Eve. See \"The First Eve,\" p. 140. This midrash makes the assumption that Cain and Abel were themselves twins, although the biblical text does not state this, and seems to imply that they were not. Sefer Zikhronot gives the name of the Cain's wife as Kalmana, and of Abel's wife as Deborah. This text also identifies these wives as their twins, contrary to the version in which Cain and Abel do not marry their own twins, but each one marries the other 's twin.",

      "content": "One night, when Cain and Abel were both young men. Eve had a terrible dream. When she awoke she told the dream to Adam: \" While I was sleeping, I saw in a night vision that the blood of our son Abel was entering the mouth of our son Cain. Cain drank his blood without mercy. Abel beseeched him to leave a little, but he drank his blood completely.\" Hearing this, Adam said, \"Surely this means that Cain must intend to kill Abel. Come, let us keep them apart. Let each of them live in a separate place.\" So Adam said to them, \"My sons, let each of you go to your own place.\" And they did. After this, God sent the angel Michael to Adam. God said, \"Adam understands that Cain intends to kill Abel. Go to him and tell him not to reveal this mystery to Cain, for Cain is a son of wrath who will kill Abel, his brother. So too should you tell Adam not to grieve because I will give him another son, Seth. Seth will bear my image, and through him many mysteries will be revealed.\" And the angel came to Adam and spoke to him, and Adam revealed what the angel told him only to Eve, and they both grieved to learn the fate of Abel. Dreams and visions are often understood to be prophetic. Here Eve has a prophetic dream or vision — she calls it a \"night vision\" — in which Cain behaves like a beast or a vampire and drinks all of Abel's blood. When Eve tells this dream to Adam, he understands its meaning at once — that Cain will murder Abel. He hopes to prevent this by separating them, but God sends the angel Michael to reveal the inevitability of this fate, as well as promising them the birth of another son, Seth, who is dearly intended to take Abel's place. The prophecy of the birth of Seth, and the description of his powers makes it seem likely that this myth reflects the veneration of Seth that played a central role in Gnosticism. For Gnostic texts about Seth see Apocalypse of Adam , where Adam communicates a secret Gnostic revelation to Seth. Eve's dream portrays Cain's crime in the stark and primitive terms of drinking a victim's blood. For an equally primitive myth, see \"How Samael Entered the Heart of Man,\" p. 454.",

      "content": "How did Cain meet his death? Some say that Cain fulfilled his destiny as a ceaseless wanderer on earth (Gen. 4:12) until the time of the Flood, and that he drowned in the Flood with everyone else, except for Noah and his family. Others say that Cain, the founder of the first city, was killed when his house, made of stones, fell upon him, stoning him to death. Thus was Cain killed in the same way he had killed his brother, confirming that a man shall be killed with the weapons with which he kills his fellow man. Still others say that Cain's final destiny was in being transformed into the Angel of Death, since he was responsible for the first death. For a hundred and thirty years Cain wandered and roamed about, accursed. Thereafter Lamech served as the Angel of Death. But most agree that Cain met his death at the hands of his own descendants, Lamech and Tubal-Cain. In those days Lamech was old and advanced in years, and his eyes were dim so that he could not see. One day his son, Tubal-Cain, was leading him while they were walking in the field, when Cain, the son of Adam, advanced toward them. And Tubal-Cain told his father to draw his bow, and with the arrows he smote Cain, who was yet far off, and he slew him, for he appeared to them to be an animal. And the arrows entered Cain's body although he was distant from them, and he fell to the ground and died. And the Lord requited Cain's evil according to his wickedness, which he had done to his brother Abel, according to the word of the Lord that He had spoken. And it came to pass that when Cain had died, that Lamech and Tubal-Cain went to see the animal they had slain, and they saw, and behold Cain their grandfather was fallen dead upon the earth. And Lamech was very much grieved at having done this, and in clapping his hands together he struck his son and caused his death. Lamech's wives, Tsila and Ada, found him later that night, and were furious to learn that he had caused the deaths of Cain and Tubal-Cain. They vowed never to share his bed again. But Lamech took them to Adam, the judge, and Adam ruled that they must obey their husband. Since the biblical narrative of Cain is unfinished, the rabbis were left to resolve the story in both a moral and a literary sense. Using the tradition of the Oral Law as their justification, and supporting their interpretations with biblical prooftexts, the rabbis embellished the tale of Cain and Abel in many respects. They filled in the sketchy details of the births of the two brothers (Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 21), the mystery of the origin of their wives (Genesis Rabbah 22:2 ), the conflict between the two ( Genesis Rabbah 22:7), the murder of Abel by Cain ( Genesis Rabbah 22:8), the burial of Abel ( Pirkei deRabbi Eliezer 21), and the punishment and ultimate fate of Cain. The end of the biblical narrative about Cain describes his punishment by God and concludes by attributing to Cain the founding of the first city (Gen. 4:17). After Cain has been cursed to become a ceaseless wanderer on earth (Gen. 4:12), he protests the severity of the sentence and has it modified (Gen. 4:13-15). Of particular interest to the rabbis was the nature of the sign by which God had marked Cain, to identify and protect him in his wanderings. One of the earliest midrashim speculating on this sign appears in Genesis Rabbah 22:12: \"And the Lord put a mark on Cain (Gen. 4:15). Rabbi Judah said: \"He caused the orb of the sun to shine on his account.' Said Rabbi Nehemiah to him: 'He caused the orb of the sun to shine! Rather, He afflicted him with leprosy/ Rab said: 'He gave him a dog.' Abba Jose said: 'He made a hom grow out of his forehead/ Rabbi Levi quotes Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish as saying, 'He suspended his punishment until the Flood came and swept him away/\" Of these five versions of the nature of the mark of Cain, the one that entered the folk tradition was that of the horn, said to be located on his forehead. The reason for this should be apparent — the horn signified Cain's essentially savage nature and thus identified him as a beast. Later this horn was incorporated into the most widely accepted account of the death of Cain, in which he was slain by his descendants Lamech and Tubal-Cain.",
      "commentary": "While this became the most popular version of Cain's death, three other versions can be found. In one attributed to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, Cain was said to have found his death along with the other victims of the Flood. But this punishment was unsatisfying in that it did not single out Cain. The rabbis strongly felt that a decisive punishment for him was called for, to set a precedent for future murderers. Another version of Cain's death appears in the apocryphal Book of Jubilees (4:31). Here Cain is said to have been killed when his house fell on him. Just as he had killed Abel with a stone, so was he slain by stones: \"Cain was killed when his house fell upon him and he died in the midst of his house, killed by its stones. For with a stone he had killed Abel, and by a stone he was killed in righteous judgment.\" Then the Book of Jubilees goes on to link this judgment with the Law: \"The instrument with which a man kills his neighbor will be the same with which he shall be killed; after the manner that he wounded him, in a like manner shall they deal with him.\" This refers to Exodus 21:24, following the pattern of You shall give life for life , eye for eye, tooth for tooth , hand for hand, foot for foot (Exod. 21:24. See also Leviticus 24:19 and Deuteronomy",

      "content": "God created two inclinations, one good and the other evil. Some say that the Evil Inclination came into being at Adam's creation, while others say it was not until the creation of Eve. For when Adam's rib was taken from him, his eyes were opened and he came to know good and evil (Gen. 3:5). The Evil Inclination that resides in the human heart entices us in this world and testifies against us in the World to Come. Because of the force of the Evil Inclination, it is difficult to extract ones elLfrom sinful behavior. Inde ed, it is said that the greater the man, the greater his Evil Inclination. At first it is like the thread of a spider, but before long it becomes as thick as the ropes of a cart. The force of the Evil Inclination holds swa y in this world, and everyone is subjec t to it, even the angels. ForwIfenTh'e angels Shemhazai and Azazel descended to earth from heaven, they became visible, and they soon became subject to the Evil Inclination and lusted after the daughters of men. T he Evil In clination grows in strength from day to day, and were it not for God's help, no one wouldbe^ble to withstand !!. Ihe rabbis ^ldT'Tf^oiImeet this repulsive wretch, drag him to the House of Study. If he is of stone, he will dissolve; if of iron, he will shiver into fragments.\" The Evil Inclination |ja^ev^nnames. God called it Evil. Moses called it the Uncircumcised. David called it UricTeanTSoIombfr called it the Enemy. Isaiah called it the Stumbling Block. Ezekiel called it Stone. And Joel called it the Hidden One. The Evil Inclination is one of the four things that God repented of having created. The others are Exile, the Chaldeans, and the Ishmaelites. In the days to come, God will bring forth the Evil Inclination and slay it in the presence of the righteous and the wicked. To the righteous it will appear as a mountain, and to the wicked it will have the appearance of a thread as thin as a hair. Both of them will weep. The righteous will weep and say, \"How were we able to overcome such a towering hill?\" And the wicked will weep and say, \"How is it that we failed to conquer this thread?\" And God, too, will marvel with them. The Evil Inclination, or Yetzer ha-Ra, is the force of evil that is present in this world because of its mat erial naturg . There is also a countervailing force, less mentioned, known as the Yefzer ha-Tov, or the Good Inclination. According to B. Bava Batra 16a, the Serpent in the Garden of Eden, Satan, the Yetzer ha-Ra , and the Angel of Death are one and the same. For versions of the story of the fallen angels, see pp. 454-460.",

      "content": "Samael, riding on the serpent, came to Eve and she conceived a child. The son that was bom was the son of Samael. Then Adam, who had been walking in the Garden of Eden, returned. He found the son of Samael crying, and he asked Eve: \"Who is he?\" And she said: \"This is Samael's son.\" And he said to her: \"Why do we need this problem here?\" And the boy was still crying, because he wanted to make Adam angry. What did the first man Adam do? He stood over him and slaughtered him and cut him into pieces. And then every piece would yell by itself. What did Adam do? He stood and boiled it, and he and his wife Eve ate it. When Samael learned that they had eaten his son, he came to them and said, \"Give me my boy.\" They said \"We didn't see anything. We don't know anything.\" And he said to them: \"You're lying.\" While they were arguing, the son of Samael spoke from the heart of Adam and Eve and said to Samael: \"Go on your way, because I have already entered into their hearts, and I am not going to leave their hearts, nor the hearts of their sons, nor the sons of their sons, throughout the generations.\"",
      "commentary": "This is a gruesome, primitive tale about the origin of evil in the human heart. The cannibalistic elements are shocking and seem inappropriate to Jewish tradition. The cruelty reflected in the myth suggests a cynical view of humanity appropriate to its subject matter. It draws on the midrash that the serpent conceived a child — Cain — with Eve. See \"How Cain Was Conceived,\" p. 447. A variant is found in IFA 1141 from Yemen, where Satan brings his son to Adam in the shape of a sheep and gives it to him to keep for a year. When Satan doesn't return on time to take his sheep, Adam butchers it and eats it with challah. Then when Satan returns and asks for his sheep, Adam lies and says that it has run away. Satan calls his son and he replies from inside of Adam, and Satan leaves him there.",

      "content": "When the generation of the Flood went astray, God began to regret having created humans. Then two angels, Shemhazai and Azazel, reminded God that they had opposed the creation of humans, saying. What is man , that You have been mindful of him? ( P s 8 :5) .. God replied: 'Those who dwell on earth are subject to the Evil Inclination. Even you would be overpowered by it.\" But the angels protested, saying: \"Let us descend to the world of humans, and let us show You how we will sanctify Your name.\" And God said: \"Go down and dwell among them.\" So the two angels descended to earth, where they were certain they could resist the power of the Evil Inclination. But as soon as they saw how beautiful were the daughters of men, they forgot their vows and took lovers from among them, even though they were defiling their own pure essence. So too did they teach them secrets of how to entice men, as well as the dark arts of sorcery, incantations, and the divining of roots. Then the two angels decided to select brides for themselves from among the daughters of men. Azazel desired Na'amah, the sister of Tubal-Cain, the most beautiful woman on earth. But there was another beautiful maiden, Istahar, the last of the virgins, whom Shemhazai desired, and she refused him. This made him want her all the more. \"I am an angel,\" he revealed to her, \"you cannot refuse me.\" \"I will not give in to you,\" Istahar replied, \"unless you teach me God's Ineffable Name.\" \"That I cannot do,\" Shemhazai replied, \"for it is a secret of heaven.\" \"Why should I believe you?\" said Istahar. \"Perhaps you don't know it at all. Perhaps you are not really an angel.\" \"Of course I know it,\" said Shemhazai, and he revealed God's Name. Now as soon as she heard the holy Name, Istahar pronounced it and flew up into the heavens, escaping the angel. And when God saw this, He said: \"Because she removed herself from sin, let Istahar be set among the stars.\" And Istahar was transformed into a star, one of the brightest in the sky. And when Shemhazai saw this, he recognized God's rebuke of his sin and repented, hanging himself upside down between heaven and earth. But Azazel refused to repent, and God hung him upside down in a canyon, bound in chains, where he remains to this day. That is why a scapegoat is sent to Azazel on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, bearing the sins of Israel. Others say that when the two angels, Shemhazai and Azazel, came down to earth, they were still innocent. But they were corrupted by the demonesses Na'amah and Lilith. The children they bore were the giants of old, known as the Nefilim, or Fallen Ones. They bore six children at each birth, and in that very hour their offspring stood up, spoke the holy language, and danced before them like sheep. There were said to be sixty in all. These giants had such great appetites that God rained manna on them in many different flavors, so that they might not eat flesh. But the Fallen Ones rejected the manna, slaughtered animals, and even dined on human flesh. Still others say that the offspring of the fallen angels were tall and handsome, and had greater strength than all the children of men. Because of the heavenly origin of their fathers, they are referred to as \"the children of heaven.\" The primary mystery of Genesis 6 is t he identity of the Sons of God. Anthropologists have suggested that they may have been a tribe of exceptionally tall and handsome men who appeared and were irresistible to women. But the ancient rabbis were certain that the Sons of God were angels, although an alternate version in Aggadat Bereshit identifies them as the Sons of Cain. As a model, the rabbis drew on the prologue to Job, where God and Satan agree to test Job to see if he is truly righteous. Here God has a dialogue in heaven with two angels, Shemha zai and Azazel, who condemn the corrupt ways of men. God arghesthat if they live? on earth they would behave the same way, because everyone on earth is subject to the Yetzer ha-Ra, t he Evil Inclina tion. The angels insist that they would remain righteous, and they convince God to let them descend to earth (in some versions, by Jacob's ladder). When they do, they are immediately filled with lust for the beautiful daughters of men, and use their heavenly powers to satisfy their desires. And the offspring of these unions are described as the Nefilim, which has been interpreted to mean giants. Thus the account in Genesis 6 also provides the origin of giants. In some versions of this myth, the two angels end up coming down to earth not to demonstrate their ability to resist the Evil Inclination, but because God cast them out of heaven for opposing the creation of man. According to Zohar Hadash, Ruth 81a, the angels acquired human form as they descended from on high. When they mated with human women, the \"daughters of men,\" their offspring were the Nefilim in Genesis 6:4, which literally means \"fallen beings.\"",
      "commentary": "There are many variants of the story of the two angels from a wide range of sources, including The Book of Enoch ( 1 Enoch) and Yalkut Shim'oni. The best-known of these stories concerns two maidens, Istahar and Na'amah, whom the two angels sought to seduce. Note that this story, with its fairy-tale quality, manages to explain who the Sons of God were, how they brought corruption to the earth, and the origin of giants. The story also demonstrates that no one, not even an angel, is immune to the Evil Impulse. Indeed, so corrupt did the angels become, that it is said that in the end they indiscriminately enjoyed virgins, married women, men, and beasts. The Sons of God are also blamed for having invented the use of ornaments, rouge, and multicolored garments to make women more enticing. The daughters of men are identified as the children of Seth, Adam's son, and therefore are human (Zohar 1:37a). The heroine of the story is, of course, Istahar, the virgin who resisted the advances of Shemhazai, and was turned into a star. Istahar is a variant name for the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar, who was equated with the planet Venus, the brightest star. As for Na'amah, the young woman who is said to have overwhelmed Azazel with her beauty, she is identified as the sister of Tubal-Cain. In later legends, Na'amah is also identified as a sister or daughter of Lilith. In most versions of this myth, Istahar demands to be told God's secret Name, the Tetragrammaton (YHVH). But in one alternate version in Beit ha-Midrash 5:156, which, because it mutes the sexual elements of the story, might be described as a midrash for children, she demands that he let her try on his wings. At first he denies that his wings come off, but when she insists, he takes them off and lets her put them on and at that moment she flies off into heaven and is transformed into a star. In later versions of this legend, the role of Shemhazai is diminished, while the role of Azazel is expanded, until Azazel is virtually identified with Satan. Ultimately, it is Shemhazai who repents and Azazel who does not. This leads to subsequent legends about the evil-doings of Azazel. According to Yalkut Shim'oni , Istahar became a star set among the seven stars of the Pleiades, while Shemhazai, hung upside down between heaven and earth, became the constellation Orion. Thus this myth may also be viewed from an astrological perspective as the origin of the constellations Pleiades and Orion.",

      "content": "There are those who say that Shemhazai and Azazel were not the only angels who descended to the face of the earth. Instead, Shemhazai was the leader of two hundred angels known as the Watchers, a high order of angels who never slept. After they descended to the summit of Mount Hermon, these angels swore an oath, binding themselves together. But when the angels fell from their holy estate, they were reduced in stature as well as in strength, and their fiery substance became flesh. At first the fallen angels intended to instruct the people in the ways of righteousness. But when they saw the beautiful daughters of men, they lusted after them, and chose wives from among them. And the children bom from this union were giants. Each of the angels, not only Shemhazai and Azazel, revealed secrets of heaven, teaching charms and enchantments, incantations and the cutting of roots, astrology and the knowledge of signs. They taught men the art of working metal to make weapons, and they taught women how to make themselves desirable to men. So too did these angels sin with anyone they desired, men as well as women, beasts as well as humans, and they became corrupt in all ways. Before long, everything on earth became corrupted, and God ordered these fallen angels to be rooted out and bound in chains in the depths of the earth. Then the foujiarchan^ Uriel, and Raphael, went to God and recountecTthe sins of the fallen angels. AnaGod said to Raphael: \"Bind Azazel hand and foot, and cast him into a canyon in the desert Dudael, and cover him with darkness, and let him abide there. And on the day of Judgment he shall be cast into the fire.\" And God said to Michael: \"Bind Shemhazai and his associates. Bind them fast for seventy generations in the valleys of the earth, till the day of judgment. Then they will be led to the fiery abyss and tormented and imprisoned forever.\" Still others say that Shemhazai and Azazel, alone among the angels, assumed human form when they descended to this world. As for the other fallen angels, they took the form of he-goats, serving as mounts for Shemhazai and Azazel. Later they were all cast into an abyss, where they still remain, imprisoned, until the end of time.",
      "commentary": "While most versions of this myth of the Sons of God focus on two angels who descended from heaven, the version in The Book of Enoch states that they descended with an order of angels. The earliest embellishments of this biblical legend are found in The Book of Jubilees 5:1-13 and 1 Enoch 6-14. The Book of Jubilees does not specify how many angels descended from heaven to earth. In 1 Enoch it says that there were 200 angels, instead of only two, Shemhazai (also known as Aza) and Azazel. In 1 Enoch Shemhazai is described as the overall leader, along with sixteen other leaders among the rebellious angels, including Azazel. In many ways, this legend of the fallen angels is the primary Promethean myth in Judaism, in that the angels divulge not only dark secrets of heaven, but secrets of the natural universe, which God had never intended for humans to know! For another Promethean myth, see \"Adam Brings Down Fire From Heaven,\" p. 137. As for the fate of the women who went astray with the fallen angels, 1 Enoch 19:2 reports that they were transformed into sirens. This is a rare reference in a Jewish text to the sirens of Greek mythology. This is the interpretation of R. H. Charles in his translation of 1 Enoch. Ephraim Isaac translates this passage in The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha as, \"And the women whom the angels have led astray will be peaceful ones.\" Considering the context of retribution, the interpretation of R. H. Charles seems more plausible. The time for this myth is said to be the days of Jared (1 Enoch 6:6). Jared was the father of Enoch, and the myth of the fallen angels is set in the generation before Enoch, but it is nevertheless an integral part of the myth of Enoch found in 1 Enoch.",

      "content": "The Sons of God took wives for themselves, and the women gave birth to great giants, the giants of old. Their height was three thousand ells. The giants quickly devoured all of the resources of humans. And when people could no longer sustain them, the giants turned against them and devoured them. And they began to sin against birds and beasts and reptiles and fish, and to devour one another's flesh and drink the blood. Then the earth made accusation against the lawless ones. The fallen angel Shemhazai fathered two sons, Hiwa and Hiya, who consumed a thousand oxen, a thousand camels, and a thousand horses daily. Before long the air was foul with the smell of carcasses. That is when God decided to cleanse the earth with the Flood.",
      "commentary": "Some say that these giants, produced by the spirit and the flesh, are the evil spirits who dwell on earth, who pursue us relentlessly till this day. Still others describe the creation of the giants in this way: the angels transformed themselves, taking the shape of men, and appeared to the women while they were with their husbands. And the women did not think of their husbands, but lusted in their minds after the forms of the fallen angels, and as a result they gave birth to giants. This myth elaborates on the origin of giants, called Nefilim, found in Genesis 6: The Nefilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them; the same were the mighty that were of old, the men of renown (Gen. 6:4). The Nefilim are generally understood to refer to the ancient giants. They are said to be the offspring of the Sons of God, who were understood to be fallen angels who came to earth and seduced the daughters of men. The giants were bom out of this union. This myth also provides the origin of the giants thought to dwell in the Land of Israel (Num. 12:31-33). While most accounts about the Nefilim attribute their birth to the mating of the Sons of God and the daughters of men, Zohar 1:37a attributes their birth to Samael having copulated with Eve, \"injecting her with slime,\" after which \"she bore Cain,\" whose features differed from other humans, and the Nefilim issued from the seed of Cain. See \"How Cain Was Conceived,\" p. 447. An interesting alternate myth is found in the Testament of Reuben, where these giants were said to be bom not by human women having intercourse with angels, but out of their fantasies about the angels, when they appeared to the women as handsome men as they had sex with their husbands. This myth offers insight into rabbinic thinking, with the belief that fantasizing about someone else while having sex with one s spouse could have unexpected consequences. Here the fantasies are attributed",

      "content": "King Solomon captured the demon Omasis and made him reveal the names of all the other spirits and demons. One by one Solomon called them up and interrogated them. One of the spirits he invoked came forth in the shadowy form of a man with gleaming eyes. \"Who are you?\" King Solomon asked. The spirit replied, \"l am a lecherous spiri t of a giantw ho died in a massacre in the age of giants.\" Solomon said, \"Where do you dwell?\" The spirit replied, \"I live in inaccessible places. I seat myself near the dead in their tombs and at midnight I assume the form of the dead. If I encounter anyone, I cause him to be possessed by a demon.\" And when he heard these things. King Solomon locked up that demon, just like all the other demons he had called forth. King Solomon questions a series of demons and spirits in The Testament of Solomon, which is a kind of demonic bestiary. One of the spirits who comes forth is this lecherous spirit who once was a giant in the time of giants alluded to in Genesis 6: The Nefilim were in the earth in those days , and also after that, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them; the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.

      "title": "The Lair Of Azazel",
      "content": "The generation of the Deluge learned the ways of evil from the fallen angel Azazej, He taught men how to make deadly weapons and women how to arouse the desires of men. They followed his teachings until the whole earth became corrupt. Therefore, at the time of the Deluge, God command ed the ang el Raphael to bind Azazel hand and foot and cast him into the darkness. Thereto rel^aphael made a hole in the desert Dudael/beyond the Mountains of Darkness, and cast Azazel there, chained upside down in the dark. Even there, Azazel did not repent, but was consumed by thoughts of revenge. Using the power of d reams, he sought out an gviLsorcerei/ and commanded him to come to him. First this sorcerer had to find his way to the Mountains of Darkness. There he was met by a de mon in the shape of a cat, with the head of a fiery serpent, and two tails. The magicians theivtodk^T&gt;dwt containing the ashes of a white cock, and cast the ashes at the catlike demon. Then the demon led him to the place where Azazel was chained. There he lit incense and stepped on the chain of Azazel three times. Then he closed his eyes, fell to his knees, and worshipped the fallen angel. That is when Azazel began to speak, revealing the darkest mysteries for fifty days. By then there was none among the living with a greater mastery of evil. Bowing farewell, the evil sorcerer was led out of the Mountains of Darkness by the catlike demon with the head of a fiery serpent. He, in turn, revealed the secret of where Azazel was hidden to other sorcerers, who sought out the fallen angel, and were tutored by him in the ways of evil. Thus did the black arts make their way into the world. The myth of the Sons of God and the daughters of men also provides one more useful identification— that of the mysterious identity of Azazel. In Leviticus 1 6:8. 10. and 16 there are references to sending a scapegoat to Azazel on Yom Kippur: Butttie ' goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, shall be set alive before Yahweh, to make expiation with it and to send it off to the wilderness for Azazel (Lev. 16:10). This Azazel is usually identified as another name for Satan. Even today, Israelis tell someone to \"Go to Hell!\" by saying \"Lekh le-Azazel\\\" Thus the myth of the descent of the two angels provides an explanation as to the identity and punishment of Azazel, the angel who refused to repent and thus was chained upside down in a canyon, where he continued to plot evil deeds. Nachmanides, in his commentary on Leviticus 16:8, writes that the scapegoat is sent to the prince who rules over places of destruction,\" a demon or a fallen angel known as Azazel, also known as Samael. This suggests that the goat is not sacrificed to God, but to some other divine entity named Azazel. The purpose of sending the scapegoat is to bribe Satan, the Accuser, the prosecutor of the Jewish people, to be silent on Yom Kippur, through this gift of the people's sins in the form of the goat. The problem, of course, is that the offering of the scapegoat to Azazel could be construed as an idolatrous act. Nachmanides solves this problem by asserting that the scapegoat is not given to Azazel by the Jewish people, but by God, as a reward for his cessation of his activity as Accuser on the Day of Atonement. Hyam Maccoby considers the gift to Azazel of the scapegoat a remnant of paganism, i.e., the worship of the god of the desert.",
      "commentary": "While 1 Enoch singles out Azazel for punishment in the desert Dudael, the version of this legend found in Emek ha-Melekh identifies both Aza (Shemhazai) and Azazel as being chained together there. This contradicts most versions of the legend, in which Shemhazai repents, and hangs himself (or is hung by God) upside down between heaven and ea rth, while it is Azazel alone who remains unrepentant, and takes on a role quite surular to that of Satan. Here the myths of Satan, Lucifer, Azazel, and Samael all converge in the story of a heavenly outcast who comes to rule the underworld. Some sources, such as Zohar 2:157b, interpret the references to \"Azazel\" in Leviticus as referring to a mountain called Azazel, not a fallen angel. This mountain was said to be a great and mighty one, and below it are unimaginable depths, where no one has ever gone. There the Other Side has unshackled power. It seems likely that the offering of the scapegoat in this Yom Kippur ritual is the remnant of some kind of sacrifice to an evil god in order to placate it. All in all, the myth of the Sons of God and daughters of men is quite useful in the way it provides midrashic explanations for many problems: the identity of the Sons of God in Genesis 6; the reason for the corruption of the generation of the Flood; the origin of giants; an astrological explanation for the star that Istahar became and the constellation of Orion, linked to Shemhazai when he hung himself upside down; as well as the identity of Azazel. The original biblical myth only provided a few of these explanations, but the rabbinic embellishments added many others, as well as some memorable stories about lustful angels and the brave virgin Istahar— whose Babylonian prototype was not exactly noted for her chastity.",

      "title": "The Giant Og",
      "content": "When all of the animals had boarded the ark, the giant Og, King of Bashan, swore to Noah and his sons that if they would take him with them on the ark, he would be their servant forever. What did Noah do? He let the giant sit on the roof of the ark, and bored a hole in the roof, and passed the giant his daily food through it. That is how Og, alone among the giants, escaped from the Flood by riding on top of the ark, as it is said. Only King Og of was left of the remaining Refaim (Deut. 3:11). Later, as King of Bashan, Og became an enemy of Israel. He is said to have uprooted a mountain and held it over the heads of the Israelites. The mountain was large enough to kill all of them at once. But God sent a swarm of rock-eating ants against him, who bored through the mountain, so that it fell from his hands and slipped over his neck. Because his teeth jutted out, he could not remove it. Then Moses, who was ten feet tall, jumped another ten feet into the air and struck Og on the ankle with a hammer (others say with a lance or a nail) and knocked him down. And because of the weight of the mountain he could not rise again and perished. As for the mountain, when Og fell down dead the mountain fell off his shoulders, and it was about to fall upon Israel. But Moses prayed to God, and some say he took a small tree and placed it under the mountain and prevented it from falling upon the people, while others say that thanks to God the mountain was suspended between heaven and earth. It is said that Og's skeleton was found by Abba Shaul. Abba Shaul, who buried the dead, once saw a deer and chased after it. The deer entered a hole in the ground and he followed it down the hole. The hole led into the thigh bone of a skeleton. He chased the deer for three miles inside the thighbone, and it still didn't come to an end. So he gave up and turned back. Later, he learned that was the skeleton of Og, King of Bashan. But some say that Og managed to survive, and in his wanderings he came to Poland in the winter. Not used to such cold weather, Og looked for a tailor, and when he found one, he demanded that the tailor make him a coat to keep him warm. He asked the terrified tailor how long it would take to make the coat, and the tailor, seeing the size of the giant, said it would take about a week. Og got angry and said that if the coat wasn't ready in a week, he would trample the town to dust. The frightened tailor gathered all the people of the town together and told them of the giant's demand. So the inhabitants scurried off to neighboring towns and brought back every tailor they could find. An army of tailors then set to work on the giant coat, finishing just in time. Suddenly they heard the giant approach. With nowhere else to hide, they jumped inside the pockets of the coat. Og picked up the coat, put it on, and placed his hands into the pockets to warm them, squeezing all the tailors together. Then, warm for the first time since coming to Poland, Og lay down to sleep and the terrified tailors escaped. But thereafter every one of them had a pale face. And that is why tailors have pale faces. As for Og, some say he is still wandering the earth. The origin of giants is recounted in Genesis 6:4: It was then, and later too, that the Nefilim appeared on earth. The Nefilim are understood to be giants who were the offspring of the mating of the Sons of God and the daughters of men recounted in Genesis 6. The story about the giant Og and Noah's ark serves to explain how giants were able to survive the Flood. It is also one of several tales about the giant Og, who was slain by Moses. Og is also identified as the King of Bashan who was the last of the remaining Refaim, understood to mean \"giants,\" as stated in Deuteronomy 3:11. Most of the tales about Og portray him as an enemy of Israel, but in this childlike story about Og and the ark, Og is a friendly if demanding giant. In other accounts Og holds a mountain over Israel, threatening to crush them. He even engages in combat with Moses. According to one of these accounts, in Bereshit Rabbah 42:8, it was Og who told Abraham that his nephew Lot had been captured (see Genesis 14:13), in hope that Abraham would be slain when he went off to fight the kings who had captured Lot, for Og hoped to marry Sarah. See the commentary on \"God Offers the Torah to Israel,\" p. 264 for more about Og's role as an enemy of Israel. The combat between Moses and Og recalls that between David and Goliath. David defeats Goliath with a sling, a child's weapon. In the case of Og, the giant is defeated by the smallest of opponents, the ants, who burrow through the mountain he intends to use to crush Israel, causing it to collapse on him. Moses then completes the conquest by leaping up and striking a blow to Og's ankle, killing him. The moral of this story, like that of David and Goliath, seems clear: little Israel, a tiny nation, is able to defeat much greater adversaries. This is possible because of God's support, and because of the bravery and unity the people show in the face of adversity. This moral is emphasized by the ants, tiny creatures who, by working together, defeat a giant.",

      "title": "Noah And The Raven",
      "content": "The first bird that Noah called upon to go forth from the ark and search for land was the raven, as it is said, Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made and sent out the raven; it went to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth (Gen. 8:6-7). But was the raven willing to go? Some say that when Noah called upon the raven to go forth from the ark, the raven was incensed. It began to argue with Noah, saying, \"Of all the birds in the ark, why do you pick on me? Your Master hates me since He commanded you to bring seven pairs of the clean creatures into the ark, but only one pair of the unclean, like me. You hate me because you could have chosen any one of the species of which there are seven pairs, but instead you chose me. What if the Angel of Heat or the Angel of Cold should smite me, wouldn't the world be short one kind? So why is it that you chose me? Or do you desire my mate?\" Others say that when Noah sent forth the raven to determine the state of the world, it went forth to and fro (Gen. 8:7) until it found a carcass of a man upon the summit of a mountain. It settled there and did not return to the ark. That is when Noah called upon the dove, and sent it forth. One of the requirements that God gives to Noah concerns the beasts he is to bring into the ark: Of every clean beast you shall take seven and seven , each with his mate; and of the unclean beasts , two and two , each with his mate (Gen. 7:2). This passage seems to allude to the system of Kosher laws, based on Leviticus 11:47. In one version, given here, the raven demonstrates great anger at Noah's order that it go forth to see if the waters of the Flood have receded. It even accuses Noah of desiring its mate. In another version, the raven goes forth, and the first thing it finds to feast on is the corpse of a man. In both versions the raven is portrayed as evil, while the dove is portrayed as good. Thus the kind of good and evil polar figures that are found among humans, such as Esau and Jacob or Lilith and Eve, are here mirrored in the rabbinic interpretations of the account of the raven in the story of the Flood.",

      "content": "Strange as it may seem, the generation of the Flood was punished by fire, not by water. For every single drop of rain that God brought down on them had first been boiled in the fires of Gehenna. Thus it was not the Deluge that took their lives, but the fact that the water was boiling. Why such a terrible punishment? Led astray by the angels known as the Sons of God who had descended to earth and corrupted them, the generation of the Flood sinned with hot passion, and therefore were punished with boiling water. It is said that boiling water descended from above, while cold water rushed from below, washing away those who were rebellious and causing them to perish. Viewing the generation of the Flood as evil, this midrash transforms the flood from one of rain to one of fire, the fire of Gehenna. Thus, for their sins, the fires of hell were rained upon them. Likewise, the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, another evil generation, were exterminated by fire that rained down on them from on high. The image of fire raining down from heaven is found in Genesis 19:24.",

And they said, \"Come, let us build us a city, and a tower with its top in the sky, to make a name for ourselves; else we shall be scattered all over the world.\" The Lord came down to look at the city and tower that man had built, and the Lord said, \"If, as one people with one language for all, this is how they have begun to act, then nothing that they may propose to do will be out of their reach. Let us, then, go down and confound their speech there, so that they shall not understand one another's speech.\" Thus the Lord scattered them from there over the face of the whole earth; and they stopped building the city.

      "commentary": "This is an origin myth that both explains the origin of many languages and the wide dissemination of people around the world. The mystery about this myth is why God feels so threatened by the attempts of the people to build a tower into heaven. After all, it is a peaceful endeavor and requires cooperation. The stated purpose of the people is simply to make a name for themselves. But God clearly feels that their true intention is to overthrow heaven and so descends to confuse their languages and scatter them abroad. Rabbinic commentaries on the Tower of Babel emphasize the malignant intentions of the builders. See \"Building the Tower,\" which follows. Archaeologists have identified the Tower of Babel with the ziggurat structures built in Mesopotamia, which resembled high towers to heaven. This seems like the likely source of the myth.",

With this miraculous language anything could be accomplished. Some say they had but to speak, and instantly their work was done. This universal language was lost when God scattered the builders and confused their tongues, but this same language will be spoken in the future, in the messianic era. Others say everything went well for these builders, andlheirwork prospered in their hands. A man who came to lay one stone found that he had laid two, and one who came to plaster two rows found that he had plastered four. Why did they build the tower? Some say they believed that the firmament was in danger of tottering, and the tower they built was to be one of four pillars to support the heavens. That was the eastern pillar, and others were to be built in the north, in the south, and in the west. Others say that they built the tower out of fear of another Flood. They hoped to avoid the waters of the Flood by inhabiting the heights of the tower, and they took axes with them to cleave the heavens, so that all the waters stored there would run out before God could cause them to flood. Still others say that they intended to overthrow heaven, to prevent God from bringing another Flood on the world. They argued that God had no right to choose the celestial spheres for Himself and assign the terrestrial world t o them. They set an idol at the top of the tower, with a sword in its hana, as a sign that they mtended to wage war against the King of heaven, and to dwell there in His place. So too did they shoot arrows into heaven, which fell back dripping blood, which convinced them that the defeat of heaven was close at hand. The builders of the tower were split up into three groups. Those who intended to live peacefully were scattered over the face of the earth. Those who intended to wage war against heaven were turned into evil spirits, demons, wraiths, and liliyot (female demons of the night). And those who intended to worship idols had their languages confounded, and could no longer communicate with each other. As for the fate of the tower, one third was consumed by fire, one third sank into the Wrth, and the remaining third still stands as a warning against challenging heaven. Even this third is so tall that from the top palm trees resemble locusts. Nor did the tower ever jose its power over mankind. Whoever passes there forgets all that he knows.",

When Lot saw them, he rose to greet them and, bowing low with his face to the ground, he said, \"Please, my lords, turn aside to your servant's house to spend the night, and bathe your feet; then you may be on your way early.\" But they said, \"No, we will spend the night in the square.\" But he urged them strongly, so they turned his way and entered his house. He prepared a feast for them and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. They had not yet lain down, when the townspeople, the men of Sodom, young and old — all the people to the last man — gathered about the house. And they shouted to Lot and said to him, \"Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may be intimate with them.\" So Lot went out to them to the entrance, shut the door behind him, and said, \"I beg you, my friends, do not commit such a wrong. Look, I have two daughters who have not known a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them as you please; but do not do anything to these men, since they have come under the shelter of my roof.\" But they said, \"Stand back!

Now we will deal worse with you than with them.\" And they pressed hard against the person of Lot, and moved forward to break the door. But the men stretched out their hands and pulled Lot into the house with them, and shut the door. And the people who were at the entrance of the house, young and old, they struck with blinding light, so that they were helpless to find the entrance. Then the men said to Lot, \"Whom else have you here? Sons-in-law, your sons and daughters, or anyone else that you have in the city — bring them out of the place. For we are about to destroy this place; because the outcry against them before the Lord has become so great that the Lord has sent us to destroy it.\" So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who had married his daughters, and said, \"Up, get out of this place, for the Lord is about to destroy the city.\" But he seemed to his sons-in-law as one who jests. As dawn broke, the angels urged Lot on, saying, \"Up, take your wife and your two remaining daughters, lest you be swept away because of the iniquity of the city.\" Still he delayed. So the men seized his hand, and the hands of his wife and his two daughters — in the Lord 's mercy on him — and brought him out and left him outside the city. When they had brought them outside, one said, \"Flee for your life! Do not look behind you, nor stop anywhere in the Plain; flee to the hills, lest you be swept away.\" But Lot said to them, \"Oh no, my lord! You have been so gracious to your servant, and have already shown me so much kindness in order to save my life; but I cannot flee to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me and I die. Look, that town there is near enough to flee to; it is such a little place! Let me flee there — it is such a little place — and let my life be saved.\" He replied, \"Very well, I will grant you this favor too, and I will not annihilate the town of which you have spoken. Hurry, flee there, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there.\" Hence the town came to be called Zoar. As the sun rose upon the earth and Lot entered Zoar, the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah sulfurous fire from the Lord out of heaven. He annihilated those cities and the entire Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities and the vegetation of the ground. Lot's wife looked back, and she thereupon turned into a pillar of salt. Next morning, Abraham hurried to the place where he had stood before the Lord, and, looking down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land of the Plain, he saw the smoke of the land rising like the smoke of a kiln. Despite Abraham's efforts to convince God to spare Sodom in Genesis 18:17-33, it was destroyed along with the city of Gomorrah. Lot's wife, who is given the name Edith in the Midrash, was turned into a pillar of salt when she disobeyed the command of the angels not to look back. The account in Genesis makes it clear that the inhabitants of these cities were sinners, and the midrashim about this episode go even further. After all, this is a city where Lot offers his virgin daughters to a mob as a means of protecting his guests. This is a perverted kind of hospitality, the opposite of the kind of hospitality Abraham demonstrated in Genesis 18 when he welcomed the same angels to his tent. The destruction of Sodom and Gemorah is parallel to the destruction wrought by the Flood, though on a smaller scale. Like the Flood, it stands as an example of God's anger when provoked by sin on a large scale. Later rabbinic tradition described God as having two thrones, a Throne of Justice and a Throne of Mercy. It was when He was seated on the Throne of Justice that God demonstrated harsh justice, as shown here.",

      "content": "Angels must have God's permission to reveal any of the secrets of heaven. But the two angels who went to Sodom, to the home of Lot and his wife, revealed a secret of the Lord. And because they revealed this secret, they were banished from heaven. What secret did they reveal? God's intention of destroying Sodom, as it is said, for Yahweh is about to destroy the city (Gen. 19:14). They wandered in exile for one hundred and thirty-eight years. Their banishment only came to an end on the night that Jacob dreamed of the ladder that reached from earth to heaven. For they were among the angels who ascended on that ^(G ^ aS ^ aC °k ^ reame&lt; ^ a b°ut it, as it is said, and angels of God ascending and descending on Here the angels who reveal God s intention to destroy Sodom to Lot are said to have been punished by being exiled from heaven for 138 years. This myth is parallel to that of the rabbinic myths about two angels, Shemhazai and Azazel, the Sons of God of Genesis 6, who were said to have descended to earth and revealed a great many secrets of heaven. They too were punished for their sins. This myth, found in Targum PseudoYonathan, explains that the punishment of the two angels came to an end when Jacob had his dream of the ladder reaching to heaven, and that they were among the angels ascending on it. This one myth, then, looks back at one biblical episode, that of the Sons of God and the daughters of men, and forward, to Jacob's dream. This linking of biblical episodes is one of the primary functions of this kind of exegesis.",

      "content": "The angels told Lot and his family not to look back when they left Sodom. When Lot's wife disobeyed and looked back, she was turned into a pillar of salt, as it is said. Lot's wife looked back , and she thereupon turned into a pillar of salt (Gen. 19:26). But why did she look back? And why was she turned into a pillar of salt?",
      "commentary": "Some say that Lot's wife, whose name was Edith, looked behind her to see if her daughters, who were married to men of Sodom, were coming after her or not. So too did she want to know what would be the end of her father's house. Instead, she saw God, who had descended in order to rain brimstone and fire upon Sodom and Gomorrah. And that is why she was turned into a pillar of salt. Others say that because she sinned with salt. Lot's wife was punished with salt. On the night that the angels visited Lot, Lot prepared a feast for them, as he had learned hospitality from Abraham, and he asked his wife to give them a little salt. She grew angry and said, \"Do you want to introduce that evil practice of giving strangers salt?\" Then she went to all of her neighbors asking for salt. In this way she alerted them to the presence of the guests, and precipitated the mob who demanded that Lot turn the angels over to them. Thus, because she sinned with salt, she was punished with salt. As for the pillar of salt, it still can be seen to this day. All day oxen lick it and it decreases until nothing remains but her feet. But in the morning the pillar of salt grows afresh. Those who see it are required to say the benediction to be pronounced on seeing Lot's wife, \"Blessed be He who wrought miracles for our ancestors in this place.\" The transformation of Lot's wife into a pillar of salt is one of the most striking images in the Bible. There still exists a pillar of salt near the Dead Sea that is identified as Lot's wife. In the Mishnah this is said to be one of the places where a blessing should be said. Other places listed in the Talmud (B. Ber. 54a) include the place of the crossing of the Red Sea and the walls of Jericho that sank into the ground. Why was Lot's wife transformed into a pillar of salt? Of course, she did disobey the angel's command not to look back, but the real reason for her punishment seems to be because in doing so she saw God, who had descended to destroy the city.",

      "title": "The Golden Calf",
      "content": "When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, the people gathered against Aaron and said to him, \"Come, make us a god who shall go before us, for that man Moses, who brought us from the land of Egypt — we do not know what has happened to him.\" Aaron said to them, \"Take off the gold rings that are on the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.\" And all the people took off the gold rings that were in their ears and brought them to Aaron. These he took from them and cast in a mold, and made it into a molten calf. And they exclaimed, \"This is your god, O Israel, who brought you out of the land of Egypt!\" When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron announced: \"Tomorrow shall be a festival of the Lord!\" Early next day, the people offered up burnt offerings and brought sacrifices of well-being; they sat down to eat and drink, and then rose to dance. The Lord spoke to Moses, \"Hurry down, for your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt, have acted basely. They have been quick to turn aside from the way that I enjoined upon them. They have made themselves a molten calf and bowed low to it and sacrificed to it, saying: 'This is your god, O Israel, who brought you out of the land of Egypt!'\" The Lord further said to Moses, \"I see that this is a stiff-necked people. Now, let Me be, that My anger may blaze forth against them and that I may destroy them, and make of you a great nation. \" But Moses implored the Lord his God, saying, \"Let not Your anger, O Lord, blaze forth against Your people, whom You delivered from the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand. Let not the Egyptians say, 'It was with evil intent that He delivered them, only to kill them off in the mountains and annihilate them from the face of the earth.' Turn from Your blazing anger, and renounce the plan to punish Your people. Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, how You swore to them by Your Self and said to them: I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven, and I will give to your offspring this whole land of which I spoke, to possess forever.\" And the Lord renounced the punishment He had planned to bring upon His people. Thereupon Moses turned and went down from the mountain bearing the two tablets of the Pact, tablets inscribed on both their surfaces: they were inscribed on the one side and on the other. The tablets were God's work, and the writing was God's writing, inscribed upon the tablets. When Joshua heard the sound of the people in its boisterousness, he said to Moses, \"There is a cry of war in the camp.\" But he answered, \"It is not the sound of the tune of triumph, or the sound of the tune of defeat; it is the sound of song that I hear!\" As soon as Moses came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, he became enraged; and he hurled the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the mountain. He took the calf that they had made and burned it; he ground it to powder and strewed it upon the water and so made the Israelites drink it. Moses said to Aaron, \"What did this people do to you that you have brought such great sin upon them?\" Aaron said, \"Let not my lord be enraged. You know that this people is bent on evil. They said to me, 'Make us a god to lead us; for that man Moses, who brought us from the land of Egypt — we do not know what has happened to him.' So I said to them, 'Whoever has gold, take it off!' They gave it to me and I hurled it into the fire and out came this calf!\" Moses saw that the people were out of control— since Aaron had let them get out of control so that they were a menace to any who might oppose them. Moses stood up in the g3te of the camp and said. Whoever is for the Lord, come here!\" And all the Levites rallied to him. He said to them, \"Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: 'Each of you put sword on thigh, go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay brother, neighbor, and kin.'\" The Levites did as Moses had bidden; and some three thousand of the people fell that day. And Moses said, \"Dedicate yourselves to the Lord this day— for each of you has been against son and brother — that He may bestow a blessing upon you today.\" The next day Moses said to the people, \"You have been guilty of a great sin. Yet I will now go up to the Lord; perhaps I may win forgiveness for your sin.\" Moses went back to the Lord and said, Alas, this people is guilty of a great sin in making for themselves a god of gold. Now, if You will forgive their sin well and good; but if not, erase me from the record that You have written!\" But the Lord said to Moses, \"He who has sinned against Me, him only will I erase from My record. Go now, lead the people where I told you. See, My angel shall go before you. But when I make an accounting, I will bring them to account for their sins.\" Then the Lord sent a plague upon the people, for what they did with the calf that Aaron made.",

      "title": "Strange Fire",
      "content": "Whenever Aaron officiated at a sacrifice, the fire of the Lord would descend to consume the burnt offering, and the Glory of the Lord appeared to all the people. When the people saw this, they fell upon their faces and sang a song of praise. But Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, said to each other, \"When our father and uncle Moses die, we shall be the chiefs of the people.\" After that Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu each took his fire pan , put fire in it , and laid incense on it; and they offered before Yahweh alien fire, which He had not enjoined upon them. And fire came forth from Yahweh and consumed them; thus they died before Yahweh (Lev. 10:1-2). Thus their souls were burnt and they paid the price for their disrespect of God. It is said that as long as Israel is in exile, and cannot sacrifice two goats on Yom Kippur, the two sons of Aaron may be a memorial of the sacrifice, and Israel may be atoned through them. Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, were, like their father, priests. They had been anointed and were allowed to perform service in the Tabernacle. Their mysterious deaths occurred when they introduced \"strange fire\" into the Tabernacle. This incident is referred to twice, in Leviticus 10:1 and Numbers 3:4, the former explaining that they had lit incense and performed a service that they had not been commanded to perform. Since they entered the Tent of Meeting for an improper purpose, they were punished with death. The deaths are said to have been by a fire that came forth from heaven, the same fire referred to in Leviticus 9:24 that consumed the burnt offering. There are several explanations given for their deaths. In Exodus Rabbah it is said that they behaved in a brazen manner, uncovering their heads and eating and drinking in the presence of God, as it is said. They beheld God and ate and drank (Exod. 24:11).",
      "commentary": "This is contrasted with the respectful behavior of Moses at the burning bush, when Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God (Exod. 3:6). Leviticus Rabbah 12:1 suggests that they might have been drunk. Leviticus Rabbah 20:10 suggests that Nadab and Abihu were impatient to replace Moses and Aaron, and wished them an early death. God, in turn, brought Nadab and Abihu an early death. Still other reasons are given in Leviticus Rabbah 20:8-10 — some say they penetrated to the inmost portion of the sanctuary, or that they brought an offering they were not commanded to bring, or entered the sanctuary without washing their hands and feet, or they did not wear the required number of garments, or they brought alien fire, that is, not from the sacrificial altar. The most serious accusation is that they \"fed their eyes on the Shekhinah.\" This implies that they did not take their great responsibility seriously or show the proper respect before God. Thus the tale of Nadab and Abihu became a warning tale about the great care that the priest must take in preparing an offering to God. Zohar 1:73a asserts that Aaron's sons drank wine in the Holy of Holies, the same wine that intoxicated Noah. One commentary on the Zohar, Ziv ha-Zohar, identifies this destructive wine with secular knowledge. The linkage between the deaths of Aaron's sons and the biblical ritual of sacrificing the two goats on Yom Kippur grows out of the fact that the chapter beginning Yahweh spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron (Lev. 16:1) prescribes the Yom Kippur ritual. For a description of the ritual of sacrificing the goats, see \"A Scapegoat for Azazel,\" p. 295.",

      "content": "When the Israelites returned from the Babylonian exile, they found the Temple in Jerusalem destroyed and cried in a loud voice to Yahweh their God (Neh. 9:4). They said: \"Woe, woe, it is the evil spirit of idolatry that has destroyed the Sanctuary, burnt the Temple, killed all tire righteous, and driven Israel into exile. And behold, he is still dancing among us.\" And they prayed to die Lord: \"You, who brought this evil spirit into being so that we could receive a reward through resisting him — we want neither him, nor the reward!\" Thereupon a tablet fell from heaven among them, on which the word \"Truth\" (emet) was inscribed. After this miracle had taken place, the people fasted for three days and nights, and at the end of that time the spirit of idolatry was delivered into their hands, and he came forth out of the Holy of Holies in the form of a fiery lion. But they approached him and plucked out one of his hairs, causing the lion to raise his voice and roar so loudly it could be heard for four hundred parasangs. And when the people heard this, they said among themselves: \"Let us hope that heaven does not have mercy upon him.\" Then they cast the lion into a huge leaden pot, and sealed its only opening with lead, because lead absorbs sound. They imprisoned the evil spirit for three days, then they discovered that there was not a fresh egg in all of the land. From this they realized that if they killed him, the whole world would end. So they blinded him and let him go. Here a paradox about the nature of sexuality and creation is presented, since this myth clearly indicates that they both spring from evil. The spirit that is captured in this talmudic tale is the incarnation of the Yetzer ha-Ra, the Evil Inclination. (There also is a Good Inclination, the Yetzer ha-Tov.) Rabbinic literature shows considerable ambiguity on this subject. While always urging that this impulse be resisted, the rabbis also recognized its essential role in the world, as this tale makes clear. Here the spirit of idolatry is overcome and captured. It is only then, however, that the people discover its role in the divine scheme — for without the Evil Impulse, the Yetzer ha-Ra, sexual desire in all creatures ceased, causing all procreation to stop. And not only fertility, but creativity was also lost. Had this continued, all animal life would have died out. In this way the rabbis acknowledge a necessary and perhaps even positive role for the Evil Inclination. Note the strongly mythical aspects of this tale, in which the Evil Impulse is personified as a fiery lion. It has strong echoes of the rabbinic legends about the golden calf, which was said to have come alive and charged around out of control ( Midrash Shir ha-Shirim 13a-13b and Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 45). The roaring of the lion in this tale is reminiscent of that in the well-known talmudic tale, \"The Lion of the Forest Ilai.\" See \"The Lion of the Forest Ilai,\" p. 149. The blinding of the spirit of idolatry is intended to indicate that the Jews curbed the unbridled passion of the Yetzer ha-Ra. Since they could not destroy the impulse — all earthly propagation depended on it— they attempted to curb it instead.",

But the people grew restive on the journey, and the people spoke against God and against Moses, \"Why did you make us leave Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread and no water, and we have come to loathe this miserable food.\" The Lord sent fiery serpents against the people. They bit the people and many of the Israelites died. The people came to Moses and said, \"We sinned by speaking against the Lord and against you. Intercede with the Lord to take away the serpents from us!\" And Moses interceded for the people. Then the Lord said to Moses, \"Make a fiery figure and mount it on a standard. And if anyone who is bitten looks at it, he shall recover.\" Moses made a copper serpent and mounted it on a standard; and when anyone was bitten by a serpent, he would look at the copper serpent and recover. Greatly frustrated with the constant complaints of the Israelites, God punishes them with \"fiery serpents.\" Exactly what these serpents are is not explained, but their bite was often fatal, and the people begged Moses to protect them from them. Moses does so in a strange way — he sets up a copper serpent on a pole for the people to look at when they have been bitten. This seems to have every earmark of idol worship (cf. 2 Kings 18:4), yet Moses sets up the copper serpent at God's direction. Numbers Rabbah 19:22 suggests they were called fiery serpents because they burned the soul.",

      "content": "A mysterious Bedouin led the sage Rabbah bar Bar Hannah to the bodies of those who died during the forty years of wandering in the desert. When they reached them, they found that all of them were lying on their backs and their bodies were intact. The knee of one of them was raised, and the Bedouin was able to pass under it, riding on a camel holding his spear upright. Rabbah cut off the blue thread from the comer of one of their prayer shawls. But as soon as he did, he found that he and the Bedouin were frozen in place. The Bedouin told him that if he had taken anything from them, to return it, for anyone who takes anything from them will not be able to move away. Rabbah put it back and they were able to move freely again.",
      "commentary": "Here the wandering sage Rabbah bar Bar Hannah is led to the Dead of the Desert — those Israelites who died during the 40 years of wandering in the desert in the time of Moses. Rabbah finds they have been miraculously preserved, and that they are the size of giants, demonstrated when the Bedouin rides a camel under one of their upraised knees. r These bodies lying in the desert are thus evidence of the truth of the Torah about the wandering of the Israelites in the desert. By implication, then, all of the Torah is true. Rabbi Samuel Eliezer Edels, known as the Maharsha, interpreted the giant size of the bodies to symbolize that they were spiritual giants. Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, on the other hand, views these figures as wicked people, receiving their life-force from the Sitra Ahra, the Other Side, the side of evil. He concludes that they died in the desert because they did not tie themselves wholly to Moses. Rabbah cuts off the blue corner thread of the prayer shawl (tallit) of one of the dead of the desert because it has been dyed with the tekhelet dye, which is required by one of the 613 commandments ( mitzvot ) of the Torah, as stated in Numbers 15:38-39: Speak to the Israelite people and instruct them to make themselves fringes on the corners of their garments throughout the ages; let them attach a cord of blue to the fringe at each corner . That shall be your fringe; look at it and recall all the commandments ofYahweh and observe them. But Rabbah finds himself unable to move after this attempted theft, and he is not released until he returns what he has taken. Rabbah is so desperate to preserve this relic of the time of Moses because even in the time of Rabbah, around the end of the third century, no one knew how to produce this dye, nor exactly what color tekhelet was. For this reason the ancient rabbis decided not to dye the thread of the tallit that was supposed to be the color of tekhelet, but to leave it white. With a few exceptions of groups that claim to have discovered the secret of how to make tekhelet , the thread has been left white till this day. The reasoning is that rather than fulfill one of the commandments of the Torah incorrectly it is better not to fulfill it at all. Numbers Rabbah 14:3 explains that God required the use of tekhelet because the blue of tekhelet resembles the sea, the sea resembles the sky, the sky resembles a rainbow, a rainbow resembles a cloud, a cloud resembles the heavenly throne, and the throne resembles the divine glory. For other examples of the tall tales of Rabbah bar Bar Hannah, see \"The Punishment of Korah,\" p. 235, and \"Where Heaven and Earth Meet,\" p. 194.",

Had God increased them and made them prosperous without exile, and had they taken possession of the land without receiving the Torah, how could He have compelled them to go the desert to receive it?

      "commentary": "This myth is an attempt to justify the difficult trials of the people of Israel during their Egyptian bondage. Here the years of slavery are viewed as a preparation for the receiving of the Torah, which, in Gikatilla's view, could not have taken place without the suffering that preceded it. Since the Torah was the greatest gift that God gave to the Jewish people, the years of Egyptian bondage must be viewed as a necessary step in order to be worthy of receiving it.",

      "content": "The Ten Lost Tribes were carried away as prisoners out of their own land, and they were sent into exile on the other side of the river Sambatyon, which can only be crossed on the Sabbath. But to cross it on that day would break the Sabbath, something the tribes would never do. There they are hidden from all other peoples. Some say they are covered by a cloud, which keeps them hidden, while others say it is the river itself that keeps them isolated, as well as the mountains of darkness. Thus they have been separated from their fellow Jews for centuries, without any communication between them. , How did the Ten Lost Tribes reach the other side of the Sambatyon? It is said that when B'nei Moshe, the Sons of Moses, were exiled to Babylon, they were told to play their harps for their conquerors. They refused, and a cloud settled about them, raised them with their families and all their belongings, and carried them off, setting them down during the night. In the morning they discovered that impassable river that surrounded them. Now the Jews who lived on the other side of the river Sambatyon were exceptional in every way. All of them observed the Law with joy, and the level of wisdom of the average man was equal to that of the wisest sages among the Jews elsewhere. When the tribe of Issachar is hard pressed, for example, they ask counsel from heaven and this is how they are answered: The Prince of Issachar envelops himself in his prayer shawl and prays in a comer of the synagogue. The answer comes by fire from heaven descending upon the Prince of Issachar. This is seen by everyone, but the answer is heard by him alone. As for the sages among the Jews of the Ten Lost Tribes, they were masters of kabbalah, familiar with the most obscure mysteries of the Torah, and there were ten who knew the pronounciation of God's secret Name, YHVH, the Tetragrammaton, while among the rest of the Jews there was never more than one such sage in each generation.",
      "commentary": "Some say that the exiles were divided into three. One-third was banished to the other side of the Sambatyon, one third was banished to the region further beyond the Sambatyon, and one-third was banished to Daphne near Riblah, where it was swallowed up. When the time of redemption has arrived, the Messiah will seek out the lost tribes who were banished to the other side of the Sambatyon, and tell them to go forth. Some say that at that time the wild waters of the River Sambatyon will subside, and a pathway of sand will lie before them, as it did for the Israelites who crossed the Red Sea. Then the people will be able to cross over, and the Messiah will lead them to the Holy Land. As for those swallowed up in Riblah, God will make underground passageways for them, and they will make their way underground through them, until they arrive at the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. Then God Himself will stand upon the mount, as it is said. On that day, He will set His feet on the Mount of Olives (Zech. 14:4). At that time God will see that the mount is split open, and the exiles will come out of it to be reunited with their long lost brethren, and to celebrate the arrival of the End of Days. Nor will these three companies of exiles come alone. Wherever Jews are to be found, they will be gathered up and come to the holy city of Jerusalem. God will lower the mountains and make them into roads for them. So, too, will God raise up every deep place for them and make all the land level, so that their journey can be as easy as possible. When all the exiles have arrived and been gathered together, God will call upon heaven and earth to rejoice with them, and the whole world will join in the celebration. There are dozens of legends about the fate of the Ten Lost Tribes, and they are identified with a great many communities, including the American Indians (partly because the Lost Tribes were sometimes described as red in the legends), the Japanese, and other unlikely peoples. Ethiopian Jews identify themselves as members of the lost tribe of Dan. Among those travelers who claimed to have discovered the Ten Lost Tribes is Eldad ha-Daru, who claimed to belong to the tribe of Dan, and asserted that he had found four of the lost tribes. According to him, the members of these tribes spoke only Hebrew. So too was their Talmud written in Hebrew, instead of Aramaic. Nor, because of their isolation, were any of these tribes able to communicate with the others. The myth of the Ten Lost Tribes is vividly portrayed in an elaborate tale of the rescue of a Jewish community by an emissary from the Ten Lost Tribes on the other side of the river Sambatyon. The tale exists in many variants, ranging from a page or",

      "content": "Ever since they went into exile beyond the river Sambatyon, the Ten Lost Tribes have been prevented from returning to their brothers in the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. It is the river itself that stops them. For six days its current is so strong that it throws up rocks as high as a house, so that it sometimes gives the appearance of being a mountain in motion. But on Friday at sunset a cloud envelops the river, so that no man can cross it, and at the same time the waters come completely to a halt. Then on the Sabbath the waters subside and disappear, and it resembles a lake of snow-white sand, and at the close of the Sabbath it resumes its torrent of rushing water, stones, and sand. The Sabbath is the only day its wild current stops flowing. Where did the river Sambatyon come from? Some say it flowed from Paradise. Others insist that Sambatyon is another name for the Euphrates. On one side of the river there are the rich fields and forests of the land that was once Assyria, and on the other side dwell the descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, who were sent into exile by the Assyrian king Shalmaneser in 722 bce. Most accounts concur that the river came into being at the time of this exile, but the reason for its creation has long been a matter of debate. There are those who insist that the river was formed to remind the lost tribes of the unchanging nature of the eternal laws, and to assure them that they had not been forgotten in their exile. Then there are those who have concluded that the river was created to keep them in exile, since the Sabbath is also their day of rest and they cannot cross on that day any more than they could on any other day of the week. And when will the waters stop running? Not until the days of the Messiah will the people be permitted to cross. The legend of the river Sambatyon is first noted by Josephus (Wars, 7:5:1, although he reverses it, describing the river as running only on the Sabbath). All other versions of the legend describe it as running six days a week and resting on the Sabbath. This is how the story goes in the Talmud (B. San. 65b) and in the Midrash (Gen. Rab. 11:5 and 73:6). Just as the children of Israel must rest on the Sabbath, so must the river. In this way the legend of the river Sambatyon serves to prove the holiness of the Sabbath and provides an explanation for the Ten Lost Tribes remaining in exile.

The histories of the city, reaching back for centuries, are filled with every detail of learning and life.

In any case, not even the armies of Nebuchadnezzar could disturb the city. Nor do the people suffer from internal strife.

      "content": "One morning, as King Solomon awoke, he heard a chirping outside his window. He sat up in bed and listened carefully, for he knew the language of the birds, and he overheard them say that the Angel of Death had been sent to take the lives of two of his closest advisers. King Solomon was startled by this unexpected news, and he summoned the two doomed men. And when they stood before him, he revealed what he had learned of their fate. The two were terrified, and they begged King Solomon to help them. Solomon told them that their only hope was to find their way to the city of Luz. For it was well known that the Angel of Death was forbidden to enter there. Therefore the inhabitants of Luz were immortal — as long as they remained within the walls of the charmed city. Very few knew the secret of how to reach that city, but King Solomon was one of those few. So it was that King Solomon revealed the secret to the two frightened men, and they departed at once. They whipped their camels across the hot desert all day, and at nightfall they saw finally the walls of that fabled city. Immortality was almost within reach and they rode as fast as they could to the city gates. But when they arrived they saw, to their horror, the Angel of Death waiting for them. \"How did you know to look for us here?\" they asked. The angel replied: \"This is where I was told to meet you.\"",
      "commentary": "This myth derives from the reference in Genesis 28:19 to Luz as the original name of the place where Jacob had his dream of the heavenly ladder. The Talmud (B. Sot. 53a) identifies the city of Luz as a city of immortals. Since the Angel of Death was not permitted to enter, the old people who had grown tired of life had to leave the city, where the angel was waiting for them. The location of the city of Luz was regarded as a well-kept secret, since it would otherwise be deluged by those seeking immortality, but such secret knowledge was easily accessible to King Solomon. See \"The City of Luz,\" p. 476. The primary moral of this tale is that it is impossible to escape that which has been fated. It is one of several tales concerning King Solomon in which he tries to outfox fate and fails. See \"The Princess in the Tower\" in Elijah's Violin , pp. 47-52. See also \"The City of Luz\" in Elijah's Violin , pp. 279-293, which recounts many of the traditions associated with this city of immortals. Many cultures have a myth about a city of immortals, and it is a theme that appears in many works of fiction, including John O'Hara's Appointment in Samarra and James Hilton's Lost Horizon. The version in the Talmud appears to be the earliest form of the myth.",

      "content": "There are six worlds beneath the earth. The best known of them is called Tevel. The sun in Tevel rises in the west and sets in the east. There are 365 kinds of creatures who inhabit Tevel, all of them different from those who live on this side of the earth. Some of them have the head of a lion and the body of a man; others have the head of a man and the body of a lion. Some have the head of a snake and the body of a man; others the head of a man and the body of a snake. So too are there beings with human heads and bodies of oxen, who speak like humans. Strangest of all the creatures in Tevel, however, are those who have two heads and four arms and four legs, but only one trunk and one stomach. When they sit at the table, they seem like two people, but when they stand up and walk around, they are like one. These creatures of Tevel are rarely peaceful. They quarrel among themselves over every little thing. Sometimes one head says, \"Let's go in this direction!\" and the other answers, \"No! Let's go the other way!\" Since they only have one body, they take one step forward and one step back — and they end up in exactly the same place where they had started. Neither head wants to give in to the other, and so they stand around all day quarreling, until it is time for the next meal. Then, since both heads are hungry, they agree that it is time to make something to eat. But when it comes to cooking the food, they can never decide on what to make. One head says, \"I want something hot!\" and the other, \"I want something cold!\" They do manage to solve this problem by cooking for both heads. First they prepare the cold dish, and then they prepare the hot one, so that the hot meal doesn't get cold while the other is being made. Finally they sit down to eat. Then, for just a little while, there is peace. But as soon as the meal is finished, the heads start arguing again. \"You ate more than I did!\" cries the first head. \"No, you ate more!\" cries the second, accusing the first of the very same thing. In his encounter with King Solomon, Ashmedai, King of Demons, put his hand in the earth and brought forth from Tevel a man with two heads and four eyes. This creature married a human wife and had six sons that resembled her and the seventh who looked like him. The one with two heads wanted two portions of his inheritance and they went to King Solomon to decide the matter. Solomon scalded one head and both cried out in pain. Then Solomon observed that they must be the same person, since they both experienced the pain. Just as there are seven heavens, so there are seven earths, of which the one with which we are familiar is only the top level. Each subsequent level is a world in itself under the earth, and one of these underground worlds is Tevel, with strange inhabitants, such as those with two heads, as described here.",

King Messiah had already come into being, for he existed in God's thought even before the creation of the sun and the moon and the stars, as it is said. His name bursts forth before the sun (Ps. 72:17). At the time of the Messiah's creation, God told him in detail of the suffering that would befall him in the future, for he would be bent down by the sins of souls as yet unborn, which were kept beneath God's throne. God asked him if he was willing to endure such things. The Messiah asked God, \"Will my suffering last many years?\" God replied, \"I have decreed it will last for seven years.\" The Messiah answered, \"Master of the Universe, I take this suffering upon myself as long as not one person in Israel shall perish. And if not only those who are alive will be saved in my days, but also those who have died from the days of Adam until the time of the Redemption. These things I am ready to take upon myself.\" God replied, \"Not one breathing creature of your generation shall I cause to perish. So too will the dead among the righteous rise from their graves to greet you.\" Then God appointed the four creatures who would carry the Messiah's Throne of Glory at the End of Days. Thus was the covenant completed between God and the Messiah. Others say that the Messiah is subjected to suffering in every generation, according to the sins of that generation. About this God said, \"In the hour of the Redemption, I shall create the Messiah anew and he will no longer suffer.\" Jewish tradition holds that the coining of the Messiah was always part of God's plan. This is emphasized here by asserting that the Messiah was brought into being before the creation of the world. The proof of the Messiah's pre-existence is said to be found in the verse, And the spirit of God moved (Gen. 1:2), words that are linked to the Messiah, of whom it is said. The spirit ofYahweh shall alight upon him (Isa. 11:2). Indeed, the Messiah is included in the lists of things that were created before the rest of creation, where it is said that the Messiah's name was engraved on a precious stone on the altar of the heavenly Temple. See \"Seven Things Created before the Creation of the World,\" p. 74.",
      "commentary": "This myth describes a strange covenant of suffering between God and the heavenly Messiah. The Messiah agrees to take on terrible suffering for seven years as a sacrifice for the people of Israel. This has a distinct echo of the Christian belief that Jesus suffered for human sins. But more than that, it mirrors the suffering the Jewish people were undergoing, and their hope that somehow they would be credited for all that suffering and be rewarded by God in the future. This suffering and these hopes are then projected onto the heavenly Messiah in this myth. The covenant has two parts, the suffering of the Messiah and the reward for all that suffering. In making this covenant, God appoints four creatures to carry the Messiah's throne, thus clearly indicating God's certainty that the Messiah will survive his time of suffering and receive the promised reward. That the Messiah is destined to sit on a throne makes this an enthronement myth about the Messiah. For another such myth, see \"The Enthronement of the Messiah,\" p. 487. Note that this myth not only mentions the creation of the Messiah, but also the recreation of the Messiah. This remarkable re-creation, it is said, will take place at the time of the Messianic era. It may refer to the existence of myths about multiple Messiahs, especially the tradition of Messiah ben Joseph, the suffering human Messiah, and Messiah ben David, the celestial Messiah, where the former prepares the way for the latter. Here \"re-creation\" may be viewed as a way of establishing a direct link between these two Messiahs, one having been re-created out of the other. See \"The Two Messiahs,\" p. 517. Note that God creates a chariot for the Messiah not unlike God's own Chariot, the Merkavah in the vision of Ezekiel. This strongly implies that the Messiah is a divine figure of the utmost importance and power, not unlike the angel Metatron, who is sometimes identified as the \"Lesser Yahweh.\"",

      "commentary": "while the sons of Jacob were busy with the selling of Joseph, while Jacob was busy mourning over Joseph, while Judah was busy taking a wife, God was creating the light of the Messiah, which will be revealed at the End of Days. These myths point to a heavenly Messiah, while others refer to an earthly one. There are various names attributed to the Messiah, including Menahem and David. Midrash Mishlei (p. 87) gives seven names for the Messiah: Yinnon, Tzidkenu, Tzemah, Menahem, David, Shiloh, and Elijah. These seven names are associated with the verse We will set up over it seven shepherds (Micah 5:4). Two primary messianic figures evolved in Jewish myth, Messiah ben David and Messiah ben Joseph. The former was said to be descended from David, the latter from Joseph. Messiah ben Joseph was generally understood as a forerunner Messiah who would prepare the way for Messiah ben David. There is another tradition that on the day the Temple was destroyed, the Messiah was bom. It is found in Lamentations Rabbah 1:51.",

All ancient laws will be reinstituted in his days; sacrifices will again be offered; the Sabbatical and Jubilee years will again be observed according to the commandments set forth in the Law. This statement by Maimonides is quite definitive, except that it does not include the resurrection of the dead, the last of Maimonides' own Thirteen Principles. Indeed, in Mishneh Torah , Hilkhot Melakhim 11:3, Maimonides denies that the Messiah will bring the dead to life: \"Do not think that King Messiah will have to perform signs and wonders, bring anything new into being, revive the dead, or do similar things.\" The two other major requirements of the Messiah are listed here by Maimonides: the rebuilding of the Temple and the Ingathering of the Exiles. Thus Maimonides downplays the supernatural elements in the messianic tradition, viewing the messianic era in practical terms that could be accomplished without overthrowing the laws of nature. Indeed, in 12:1, he states this explicitly: \"Let no one think that in the days of the Messiah any of the laws of nature will be set aside, or any innovation be introduced into creation. The world will follow its normal course.\"",

      "title": "The Soul Of The Messiah",
      "content": "Like Adam's soul, the soul of the Messiah is comprised of all other souls. Indeed, the soul of the Messiah contains the souls of all generations. For one who encompasses all generations in his soul possesses the powers of the entire world. And when he repents, he can arouse repentance in everyone. Some say that the soul of the Messiah has been exiled to a place of desert and desolation where no one walks. A storm wind rose up and created such confusion that the Messiah lost all the signs that were given to him, with which he was to identify himself before the people of Israel. As a result, it became impossible to recognize him, for he had no way of revealing himself. Furthermore, some of the lost signs and marvels of the Messiah were found by false prophets who began to appear, calling themselves by the name Messiah. But once their lies and wantonness were exposed, their false teachings were revealed for all the world to see. Others say that the soul of the Messiah has been chained and is being held captive by the forces of evil. Not until the chains of the Messiah are broken will the captive soul of the Messiah be set free. Still others believe that after the Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks, the soul of the Messiah, which was sunk among the broken vessels, sent forth sparks in every generation. If a generation is worthy, that spark might become the Messiah, and the footsteps of the Messiah would be heard throughout the world. The soul of the Messiah is described in terms that make it all-inclusive. Like the traditions about Adam's soul, the Messiah's soul is said to contain all souls, even all generations of souls. See \"Adam's Soul,\" p. 162. There are various myths portraying the Messiah's soul as being exiled or imprisoned. One such myth describes it as being held captive in chains. Others describe the soul as being lost in a desert. From the time of Moses there was the tradition that the Redeemer could be identified by a sign. In the case of Moses, the words were I have taken note of you (Exod. 3:16). In die Midrash, Serah bat Asher, who lived from the time of Jacob until the time of Moses, is said to have identified Moses as the Redeemer. Likewise, there are certain signs that are said to accompany the Messiah, and here even these signs are said to have become lost, suggesting a time so chaotic that even if the Messiah appeared, no one would recognize him. These accounts of exile and imprisonment are meant to explain why the Messiah has not yet come. As long as the Messiah's soul is being held captive, it cannot descend into the body of the Messiah, and therefore prevents the birth and coming of the Messiah. One of the myths about the Messiah's soul derives from a Shabbatean source, the writings of Nathan of Gaza, primary apostle of Shabbatai Zevi, the false Messiah of the seventeenth century. This is a kabbalistic myth, based on the Ari's myth of the Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks. For more on the myth of the Ari see p. 122. In this Shabbatean myth, a spark of the Messiah's soul descends in each generation, and if the generation is worthy, the spark will become the Messiah. This places the onus for the coming of the Messiah on the piety of each generation, and means that the coming of the Messiah will not take place until there is a worthy generation. See \"The Chains of the Messiah,\" p. 492 and \"The Captive Messiah,\" p. 498.",

      "content": "The soul of the Messiah lives in a palace in heaven. There is a potential Messiah bom on earth in every generation. That person, known as the Tzaddik ha-Dor, the most righteous of his generation, has both an earthly soul and a heavenly soul. If the time is right for the Messiah to come, then the heavenly soul will descend and fuse with the earthly soul, and the days of the Messiah will have arrived. In recent times some members of the Lubavitch Hasidim came to believe strongly that their Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, was the Messiah. In addition to a public campaign for \"Messiah Now,\" Lubavitch theologians searched the existing messianic traditions for evidence that the Rebbe, as he was universally known, was the Messiah. Here they encountered two apparently contradictory traditions. One holds that the Messiah is a divine figure, who makes his home in a heavenly palace. The other tradition holds that the Messiah will be the Tzaddik ha-Dor , the greatest sage of his generation — a human being. These were originally two separate messianic traditions in Judaism, but they were eventually linked. The earthly, human Messiah was",

What role will the Messiah play after he initiates the messianic era? In this myth, the Messiah comes to sit at the right hand of God. Thus the Messiah receives the kind of enthronement found in other myths about Adam, Enoch, Jacob, Moses, and King David. What is unusual is not only that Abraham sits at God's left hand, but that the arrival of the Messiah means that the figure who receives enthronement will be one of a trinity rather than a duality. This is surely significant and might indicate the influence of the Christian concept of the Trinity.",

      "content": "For reasons known only to Him, God caused events to occur whereby the Messiah will be bom from the realm of evil, for the Messiah will descend from the House of David. And King David was descended from Ruth the Moabite, and Moab was the son of one of the two daughters of Lot. After the destruction of Sodom, Lot, who was intoxicated, committed incest with his daughters. Thus when God said, \"J have found David \" (Ps. 89:21), where did He find him? In Sodom. Thus the soul of the Messiah is descended from such a place. If the Messiah were to descend from a righteous person rather than the incestuous Lot, no enemy would have been able to prevail against Israel, or cause them to be forced into exile. God ordained things to happen this way, although no one knows why. David wanted to banish the evil side from which he had been bom, eliminating it from the world, but he was unable to do so, for he had no power over the side of evil, since he had been bom from it. In the Zohar and later kabbalistic and Hasidic commentaries, the incestuous union of Lot and his daughters (Gen. 19:30-38) is identified as the source of the power of the Yetzer ha-Ra, the Evil Impulse. This leads to the mysterious conclusion that the Messiah will descend from the side of evil. The key concept here is that the Messiah's soul is closest to evil, possessing great intensity. But in the messianic era the evil soul will be transformed, by a process of tikkun — repair or restoration — into the good.",

It is there that the Messiah waits for the sign to be given that his time has come at last. The palace is known as the Bird's Nest because of the wonderful bird of the Messiah, which has its nest in a tree near his palace. On New Moons and holy days and Sabbaths, the Messiah enters those halls of longing, lifts up his voice, and weeps. Then the Garden of Eden trembles and the firmament shakes until his voice ascends all the way to God's throne. And when God hears his voice, God beckons the enchanted bird, and it flies from the Garden of Eden and enters its nest and begins to sing. Now the song of that bird is indescribably beautiful; no one has ever heard a music so sublime. Three times the bird repeats its song, and then the bird and the Messiah ascend on high, to the very Throne of Glory. There God swears to them that He will destroy the wicked kingdom of Rome and will give His children all the blessings that are destined for them.

      "content": "In the sabbatical year. King Shabbatai, the Messiah, will return from the River Sambatyon mounted on a celestial lion. His bridle will be a seven-headed serpent, who breathes devouring fire. He will be accompanied by his predestined bride. All nations and kings shall bow low before him. On that day the Ingathering of the Exiles shall take place, and the heavenly Temple will descend from above, already built. So too will the resurrection of those who have died in the Holy Land take place, while those who died outside the Holy Land will be resurrected forty years later. This messianic prophecy derives from a letter sent by Nathan of Gaza, prophet of Shabbatai Zevi, in the fall of 1665. It contains his prophecy that Shabbatai Zevi would return as the long-awaited Messiah from the river Sambatyon to fulfill the three essential requirements of the Messiah: the Ingathering of the Exiles, in which all Jews in the world will be brought to the Holy Land; the resurrection of the righteous dead; and the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem. Here the Temple, already built, descends from heaven. Some messianic traditions assume the earthly Temple will be rebuilt, while others describe a Temple that will descend from on high. See \"The Descent of the Heavenly Temple,\" p. 512. Note that in Nathan of Gaza's prophecy, Shabbatai Zevi returns from the mythical river Sambatyon, which is said to run wildly six days a week, and only to rest on the Sabbath, trapping the Ten Lost Tribes on the other side, since they cannot cross on the that day. See \"The River Sambatyon,\" p. 475. This reinforces the supernatural qualities of Shabbatai Zevi. In reality, Shabbatai Zevi abruptly converted to Islam in September 1666, when the messianic excitement he had stirred up was at its height.",

During that time, iron beams will be brought and loaded upon his neck until his body is bent low. Then he will cry out, his voice rising to the highest heavens, saying to God, \"How much can my spirit endure? How long before my breath ceases? How much more can my limbs suffer?\" God will reply, \"My Messiah, long ago you took this ordeal upon yourself. At this moment, your pain is like My pain. You, like Me, suffer for the sake of Israel. This I swear to you — ever since My Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, I have not been able to bring myself to sit on My throne.\" At these words the Messiah will say, \"Now I am reconciled. The servant is content to be like his Master.\" After that Elijah will comfort the Messiah in one of the halls of Paradise. He will hold the Messiah's hands against his chest and say, \"Bear the suffering God has imposed upon you because of the sins of the Jewish people until the End of Days. Have courage — the end is near.\" And when he hears this, the Messiah will be comforted. The Messiah suffers pains over the sins of Israel, and here, in the seven years before the initiation of the messianic era, God decrees great suffering for the Messiah, who accepts it as part of his burden. The theme of the suffering Messiah obviously recalls the passion of Jesus, and Jewish tradition may in this case have been influenced by Christian tradition.

      "content": "The Ba'al Shem Tov was once praying with his Hasidim. That day he prayed with great concentration, not only word by word, but letter by letter, so that the others finished long before he did. At first they waited for him, but before long they lost patience, and one by one they left. Later the Ba'al Shem Tov came to them and said: \"While I was praying, I ascended the ladder of your prayers all the way into Paradise. As I ascended, I heard a song of indescribable beauty. At last I reached the palace of the Messiah, in the highest heavens, known as the Bird's Nest. The Messiah was standing by his window, peering out at a tree of great beauty. I followed his gaze and saw that his eyes were fixed on a golden dove, whose nest was in the top branches of that tree. That is when I realized that the song pervading all of Paradise was coming from that golden dove. And I understood that the Messiah could not bear to be without that dove and its song for as much as a moment. Then it occurred to me that if I could capture the dove, and bring it back to this world, the Messiah would be sure to follow. \"So I ascended higher, until I was within arm's reach of the golden dove. But just as I reached for it, the ladder of prayers collapsed.\" In this Hasidic tale, \"The Ladder of Prayers,\" the Ba'al Shem Tov ascends into Paradise on a quest to capture the golden dove of the Messiah, certain that this will cause the Messiah to follow, initiating the messianic era. The failure of the Ba'al Shem Tov's Hasidim to provide the support needed for this great endeavor, as symbolized by the collapse of die ladder of prayers, causes him to lose the opportunity to bring the Messiah. That makes this one more tale about why the Messiah has not come. Dozens of other such tales record lost opportunities to bring about the messianic era, or attempts to force the Messiah's hand, and hasten the End of Days.",

      "content": "The Messiah sits at the entrance of the gates of Rome. Around him sit the poor, wrapped in bandages, suffering from disease. Like them, the Messiah is bandaged from head to toe. When the beggars are ready to change their bandages, they unwind them all at the same time. But the Messiah changes them one by one, in case he should be summoned, so that he will be ready. Like the beggars and lepers around him, the Messiah is wrapped in bandages, suffering from some unstated disease, presumably leprosy. The story also suggests how close the Messiah is to coming— he's already at the gates, waiting for the signal from heaven that the messianic era has finally arrived. This is one of the myths about a suffering Messiah. \"The Captive Messiah,\" p. 498, is another example of this type.",
      "commentary": "This myth about the Messiah emerges out of an unusual dialogue between Elijah the Prophet and Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. Rabbi Joshua is said to have once found Elijah standing at the entrance of the cave of Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai. Rabbi Joshua asked him, \"When will the Messiah come?\" Elijah replied, \"Go ask him yourself.\" Joshua ben Levi asked where the Messiah could be found, and Elijah answered that he sits among the beggars at the gates of Rome. The story goes on to relate that Rabbi Joshua sought out the Messiah there and asked when he would come. The Messiah's enigmatic answer was, \"Today.\" Rabbi Joshua returned to Elijah and said that the Messiah had lied to him, because he had said he was coming that day and he did not. Elijah replied, \"What he told you was that he would come, if you would but heed his charge this day\" (Ps. 95:7). Thus, the Messiah is ready to come, but we are not ready for him.

Then the Messiah will wrap himself in prayer and gird himself as a hero before God.

My eyes have beheld no light and my ears have heard great reviling, and my heart broke with pain and grief. You know that I have not acted for my own glory, nor for the glory of my father's house, but for Your glory have I acted, and for Your children who dwell in sorrow among the peoples of the world.\" Then the Messiah will say to the children of Israel: \"Go and assemble all your brethren from all the nations.\" And they will go and assemble all Israel and bring them to stand before the Messiah, as it is said. And they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations as an offering to Yahweh (Isa. 66:20).",

      "content": "Before his death, the Rabbi of Riminov let it be known that he would not set foot in the Garden of Eden until the time of the Messiah had come. After his death, the angels sought to convince him to enter, for he had long been awaited, but he refused. They sought to lure him into the Garden by showing him many wonderful things, but their efforts were in vain. Still, it was not yet time for the Messiah to come. So they asked King David to play on his harp, and when that haunting music drifted out of the Garden and reached the Rabbi of Riminov, he followed after it as if in a trance, and in this way he was lured inside at last. Likewise, Rabbi Shalom Rokeach, the Belzer Rebbe, once said, \"One time I dreamt that I was brought to Gan Eden and shown the walls of Jerusalem. The walls were in ruins and a man was walking on them. I asked, 'Who is that man?' I was told that this is Rabbi Israel Ba'al Shem Tov. He has sworn not to come down from there until the Temple is rebuilt.\" There are quite a few stories about rabbis who vowed not to enter Gan Eden until the Messiah had come, but were somehow seduced into entering the Garden. The Rabbi of Riminov (1755-1815) and the Belzer Rebbe (1779-1855) are both great Hasidic masters, and, of course, the Ba'al Shem Tov is the founder of Hasidism. Their links to this tale of the refusal of the heavenly reward were intended to emphasize their great hope in the coming era of the Messiah, which would have to include the rebuilding of the Temple. Among others who refused to enter the Garden of Eden was the Rabbi of Ujhely, who was finally lured into the Garden by an invitation to give a d'var Torah , a sermon. Because awareness of time doesn't exist in the Garden, he is said still to be speaking. See also \"The Pact\" in Gabriel's Palace , pp. 256-257, about three rabbis who make a vow to force the coming of the Messiah.",

      "content": "For many generations the Messiah has sat captive, chained with golden chains before the Throne of Glory. Elijah has tried to release him many times, but he has never succeeded. So Elijah descends to earth and explains that in order to break the chains of the Messiah, he needs a magic saw whose teeth are the deeds of Israel. Every deed adds a tooth to this saw, but every sin takes one away. When there are twice as many good deeds as there are sins, then the saw can be used. That is why it is said that the Messiah will not come until we bring him. A number of texts describe the Messiah as bound in chains. According to Pirkei Hekhalot Rabbati, for example, God will tie up the Messiah hand and foot for eight years, and during the years that the Messiah is fettered, God will hide His face from him. This is a reminder that the decision of bringing the End of Days, which the Messiah will herald, does not belong to the Messiah, but to God, or to the people Israel, whose good deeds will make it possible. Adding to the complexity, there are even myths in which God Himself is in chains. See \"Mourning over the Shekhinah,\" p. 58.",

While they were wondering where it was, Elijah the Prophet appeared before them in the form of an old man and showed them the way. And when they reached the foot of Mount Zion, Elijah said: \"Now my sons, ascend Mount Zion until you reach the entrance of King David's tomb, and enter there and go down the steps, until you reach the bottom of the tomb.

All the nations of the world will be agitated and frightened. The wisdom of the scribes will become foolish, and those who shun sin will be despised. The meeting place of scholars will be laid to waste and given over to harlotry. Pious men and saints will be few, and the Law will be forgotten by its students. The young will insult their elders, and the elders will wait upon the young. Arrows of hunger will be sent forth, and a great famine will arrive, as it is said, \"A time is coming ,\" declares Yahweh, \" when I will send a famine upon the land: not a hunger for bread or a thirst for water, but for hearing the words of the Lord\" (Amos 8:11). Then, all at once, they will all be seized with pangs like the pangs of a woman in labor. At that time Israel will cry out in fear, and God will reply, \"My children, be not afraid. The time of your redemption has come.\" The struggles that will take place before the advent of the Messiah are known as the \"Pangs of the Messiah.\" These pangs are said to include a great war to be known as the War of Gog and Magog. For Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira, who experienced great upheaval firsthand in the Warsaw Ghetto, the purpose of the Pangs of the Messiah is to cleanse sins before the Messiah's arrival. For him, these pangs make it possible for Israel to give birth to the Messiah. He links these pangs to God's words to Eve, \"In pain shall you bear children\" (Gen. 3:16), and he observes that before a seed can bring forth a new creation, the seed must be annihilated. In the same way, the \"Pangs of the Messiah\" refers to the annihilation that must take place before the birth of a new creation. Israel must suffer birth pangs in order to give birth to the light of the Messiah.",

At present, the colors of the rainbow are dull, serving merely as a reminder that there will not be another Deluge. But the rainbow that announces the Messiah will have brilliant colors and be adorned like a bride for her bridegroom. When this rainbow appears, it will be a sign that God has remembered His covenant with Israel, and that the footsteps of the Messiah will soon be heard. In Genesis 9:12-13, God says about the rainbow: \"This is the sign that I set for the covenant between Me and you, and every living creature with you, for all ages to come. I have set My bow in the clouds, and it shall serve as a sign of the covenant betiueen Me and the earth.\" The rainbow serves as a covenant between God and all living creatures that God will not bring on another Deluge, as in the time of Noah. The present myth of the rainbow of the Messiah identifies the rainbow as another kind of covenant, that of bringing Israel out of exile. This Ingathering of the Exiles is one of the requirements of the coming of the Messiah. Here the transformed rainbow, its colors restored to their heavenly perfection, becomes a sign of the impending arrival of the messianic era.",

They will scream until their throats become hoarse— and it will do no good. For whenever it is predicted that the Messiah will come at a certain time, it can be certain that he will not come in any manner whatsoever at that time. Furthermore, anyone who tries to calculate the End of Days will be severely cursed. For the Messiah will come only when the minds of men are distracted from thinking of him. For many centuries, predictions were rampant about when the Messiah would arrive. Pious Jews always hoped it would be in their lifetimes. Of course, all of these predictions fell through. Here Rabbi Nachman suggests that it is time to give up making such predictions, for they inevitably fail. He even suggests that it is the prediction itself that causes the failure. This seems to be the application of the general belief that if we want something too much, we will never get it. It is remarkably parallel to Franz Kafka s paradox that 'The Messiah will not come until he is no longer needed.\" In Rabbi Nachman's version, the Messiah will not come until the people give up on waiting for him and instead live a pious life without constant thought of their reward.

      "content": "In the generation when the Messiah comes, fiery seraphim will be sent into the Temple, and stars will appear like fire in every place. The glory of the Shekhinah will fill the Temple, and God will bring down His throne and set it in the Valley of Jehoshaphat. At that time God will clothe the Messiah with a diadem, and He will place a helmet of salvation on his head, and gird him with brilliance and splendor. He will also adorn him with glorious garments and place him on a high mountain, and the Messiah will announce, \"Salvation is near!\" Then the Messiah will proclaim the news to the patriarchs and to Adam, who sleeps in the cave of Machpelah. And Adam will immediately stand up along with his generation, as well as the patriarchs and all the generations from the beginning of time to the last day The age of the Messiah will last 400 years, and after that the Messiah shall die, along with all in whom there is human breath. Then the world will be turned back to primeval silence for seven days, as it was at the beginning of Creation, as it is said. The heavens shall melt away like smoke , and the earth shall wear out like a garment (Isa. 51:6).",
      "commentary": "This is a supernatural portrayal of the End of Days, where the transformation of the world will be evident to everyone and the presence of divine figures, including God, the Messiah, and angels (in the form of fiery seraphim), will be experienced in this world. It includes the rebirth of the great figures of the past, such as Adam and the patriarchs, which is one of the requirements of the Messiah. This, then, is an ultimate fantasy of redemption, when the messianic era that was awaited so long finally arrives. Of interest, however, is the 400-year time limit associated with this description of the messianic age. After that, it is said that the world will come to an end, to be followed by resurrection and judgment.",

They will travel from east to west, toward the Holy Land. The mountains before them will turn into a blooming garden. Every tree will bear fruit, and the stones will turn to meat and rice, and the people will eat to their hearts' content. After this the Messiah will come, and he will separate those who are believers from those who are not. The nonbelievers will go to Gehenna, and the believers will journey with the Messiah to Jerusalem. That is how the end of the world will come. This a folk version of the onset of the messianic era. It follows the essential mythic pattern in which the dead are restored to life — these are the people who climb out of the earth, the righteous are gathered to the Holy Land, and the arrival of the Messiah takes place. The details about every tree bearing fruit and stones turning into food demonstrate that the folk understanding of the messianic era is one in which people will still retain the desire to eat, and there will not be any shortages of food.",

      "content": "The hand of the Lord came upon me. He took me out by the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the valley. It was full of bones. He led me all around them; there were very many of them spread over the valley, and they were very dry. He said to me, \"O mortal, can these bones live again?\" I replied, \"O Lord God, only You know.\" And He said to me, \"Prophesy over these bones and say to them: O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord! Thus said the Lord God to these bones: I will cause breath to enter you and you shall live again. I will lay sinews upon you, and cover you with flesh, and form skin over you. And I will put breath into you, and you shall live again. And you shall know that I am the Lord!\" I prophesied as I had been commanded. And while I was prophesying, suddenly there was a sound of rattling, and the bones came together, bone to matching bone. I looked, and there were sinews on them, and flesh had grown, and skin had formed over them; but there was no breath in them. Then He said to me, \"Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, O mortal! Say to the breath: Thus said the Lord God: Come, O breath, from the four winds, and breathe into these slain, that they may live again.\" I prophesied as He commanded me. The breath entered them, and they came to life and stood up on their feet, a vast multitude. And He said to me, \"O mortal, these bones are the whole House of Israel. They say, 'Our bones are dried up, our hope is gone; we are doomed.' Prophesy, therefore, and say to them: Thus said the Lord God: I am going to open your graves and lift you out of the graves, O My people, and bring you to the Land of Israel. You shall know, O My people, that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves and lifted you out of your graves. I will put My breath into you and you shall live again, and I will set you upon your own soil. Then you shall know that I the Lord have spoken and have acted\" — declares the Lord. The belief in the bodily resurrection of the dead can be traced to this powerful biblical myth of Ezekiel, in which God compels him to resurrect, with his prophesying, the bones in the valley of the dry bones. Here God's intention to bring the people of Israel back to life is presented as an explicit promise, with a powerful demonstra-",

      "content": "How will the dead come to life? God will take the Great Shofar in His hand and blow on it seven times, and its sound will go forth from one end of the world to the other. At the first blast, the whole world will shake and suffer the pangs of the Messiah. At the second blast, dust will be scattered over the face of the earth and the graves will open. At the third, the bones will gather together. At the fourth, the limbs will stretch out. At the fifth, skin will be stretched over them. At the sixth, spirits and souls will enter the bodies. At the seventh, God Himself will raise and resuscitate them and make them stand on their feet. The Great Shofar is the second horn of the ram that Abraham slew at Mount Moriah. The first ram's horn was blown by Moses at Mount Sinai. In most messianic traditions, it is said that Elijah will blow the second horn. Here, however, it is God who blows on it to initiate the End of Days. It is also said that God will blow this shofar when He leads the exiles of Israel into their land. See Isaiah 27:13. The portrayal of the stage-by-stage resurrection of the dead is strongly influenced by Ezekiel's vision of the valley of dry bones (Ezek. 37:1-14). Both take place in stages, but in the present myth these stages, delineated by the blast of the Great Shofar, are similar to the creation of Adam in Genesis. An alternate version of the resurrection in Pesikta Hadta states that \"God will bring dust of the earth and dust of the dead, and mix them together, and put into it skin and flesh and sinews and bones. And the angel in charge of souls will come and infuse souls into the bodies. Then they will enter the House of Study where Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob sit before God, the kings of Israel and Judah sit behind Him, and David sits at the head.\"",

      "title": "The Dew Of Resurrection",
      "content": "From where does the dew of resurrection descend? From the head of God, as it is said, \"For My head is drenched with dew, My locks with the damp of night\" (S. of S. 5:2). When the time comes to resurrect the dead, God will shake His locks and bring down the dew of resurrection, and by means of that dew, all the righteous dead will rise from the dust. Others say that after the reviving dew descends, God will seat each person between His knees, and embrace them and kiss them and bring them to life in the World to Come.",
      "commentary": "This myth finds its source in the verse For your dew is like the dew on fresh growth (Isa. 26.19). In these myths, God takes a most active role in the resurrection. In other myths, the resurrection happens as the final stage of a process, or there is an angel who is charged with raising the dead. But here God is the source of the dew that brings about the resurrection. He even takes each person, one by one, to Himself, and brings him or her back to life. Note that the World to Come is identified here with the messianic era, although they usually refer to separate traditions, where the World to Come is the world of rewards for the souls of the righteous when they leave this world, and the messianic era refers to this world after its transformation at the End of Days. Maimonides defines the World to Come as follows: \"The life after which there is no death is the life of the World to Come, in which there is no body, for the World to Come consists of souls with no bodies, like the angels\" (Maimonides, Ma'amar Tehiyat ha-Metim). As for the messianic era, it will bring about a great transformation in which this world will become a paradise on earth. In effect, it will restore the whole world to the kind of pristine purity found in the Garden of Eden before the Fall. What is the dew of God? In Zohar 3:128a, Idra Rabbah, this dew is described as \"the light of the pale glow of the Ancient One. And from that dew exist the supernal saints, and it is the manna which they grind for the righteous in the World to Come.\"",

That is why the sages said, \"The World to Come has neither eating, nor drinking, nor sex in it, but the righteous sit with their crowns on their heads and enjoy the splendor of the Shekhinah.\" Thus the souls of the righteous exist there without toil, but the knowledge they acquired in their lifetimes remains with them. Indeed, because of it they merited the life of the World to Come. Thus the crowns that they wear are the crowns of knowledge. And there, in the World to Come, they enjoy the splendor of the Shekhinah , for now they can grasp the truth of God that they did not know when they were burdened with a body.

Then God will bring the righteous wine that had been preserved from grapes from the six days of Creation. Only once before has it been served: when Jacob served wine to his father, Isaac, at the time he brought the food that Rebecca had prepared. Since Jacob had no wine with him, an angel provided some for him, and the angel brought that messianic wine. And he gave it into Jacob's hand, and Jacob handed it to his father, and he drank.

      "content": "The Torah of the mundane world is worthless compared to the Messianic Torah of the World to Come. This Torah will taught by the Messiah, or, some say, even by God Himself. This is the Torah that God delights in, which is studied by the righteous in the World to Come. It begins with aleph , the first letter of the alphabet, while the earthly Torah begins with bet , the second letter. Study of the Torah will continue in the World to Come, but the Torah that will be taught there will be far more profound than the Torah of this world. This is the Torah that God delights in, and from which the righteous learn in the heavenly Garden of Eden. This notion of a transformed text is also found in the traditions concerning the first tablets of the Law that were given to Moses on Mount Sinai. See \"The First Tablets,\" p. 266. For the kabbalists, such as Hayim Vital of Safed in the sixteenth century, the true meaning of the Torah was not in its literal meaning, but in the secret, inner meanings. Further, redemption — i.e., the messianic era — could only be achieved by means of kabbalah. Hayim Vital's description of the Torah of this world as relatively \"worthless\" might seem shocking, but since the mundane dimension of the Torah concerns rules relevant to human beings, it has no relevance in the World to Come. In fact, in one midrash Moses convinces the angels that they have no need for the Torah, since it is relevant only to humans. However, kabbalists are discarding only the literal level of the Torah; the higher levels of interpretation are considered to contain infinite mysteries. The notion of a Messianic Torah grows out of the tradition that there are two Torahs in Judaism, an Oral Torah and a Written Torah. See \"The Two Torahs,\" p. 277. For more on the tradition that the Messiah will teach Torah in the World to Come, see \"The Messiah's Yeshivah,\" p. 518.",

      "content": "In the time to come God will bring the skin of Leviathan and make a tabernacle for the righteous, as it is said. Can you fill his skin with tabernacles? (Job 40:31). If a man is worthy, a tabernacle will be made for him. If he is not worthy, a mere cover of fish skin will be made for him, as it is said. And his head with a fish covering (Job 41:7). The rest of the skin of Leviathan will be spread by God on the walls of Jerusalem and the roof of the sanctuary, and its splendor will shine from one end of the world to the other. Then the righteous of Israel will sit, eat, drink, be fruitful, multiply, and enjoy the splendor of the Shekhinah. This myth is obviously a companion to \"The Messianic Banquet.\" Just as \"The Messianic Banquet\" describes the extravagant banquet God will provide to the righteous in the World to Come, so this myth describes the kind of shelter they will receive, as food and shelter are a person's most essential concerns. The implication is that each person will have an individual shelter, a sukkah made of the skin of Leviathan, or, if one is not worthy of that, made of fish skin. A further example found in Talmud says that God will provide a necklace for the righteous in the World to Come, but if they are not worthy of it, they will receive an amulet instead. These related myths not only describe the kind of rewards expected in the messianic era, but also imply that people can expect to retain their individuality as well as their desire for privacy in the World to Come, and that God will fulfill these needs. Even the need to be fruitful and multiply will be fulfilled. As Seder Gan Eden puts it, \"Every woman among the Israelites will give birth to children every day.\"",

As soon as Jerusalem reaches the Throne of Glory, God will say, \"You and I will walk together through the universe.\" Others say that Jerusalem will expand on earth until it reaches Damascus, for Jerusalem is destined to widen on all sides, and the exiles will come and repose beneath it as they would beneath a fig tree.",
      "commentary": "This myth wrestles with the problem of where to fit all the righteous who are resurrected at the End of Days. Jerusalem just isn't big enough to hold everyone, so it is proposed that God will raise Jerusalem to heaven. An alternate version suggests that the boundaries of the city will simply be expanded, something that has already happened with the modern state of Israel, though not all the way to Damascus. See \"The New Jerusalem,\" p. 510. Some versions say that God will provide seven canopies for every righteous person, or that God will make a canopy for every one according to his status.",

And the Bride of God will fill it, and God's glory will fill its hall, and inside each angel will be busy with his work, Gabriel and Michael and their myriads. And at Zion's restoration, the very mountains will burst into song. The mountain of the Lord's house will lead in the singing, and the lesser mountains will answer. The Holy of Holies of the future Temple will be built of twelve onyx stones. The radiance of the Holy of Holies will illuminate the entire world and ascend to the Throne of Glory. How will people go there? They will fly like clouds and like doves. In this way great multitudes will enter the Temple to be blessed with eternal life. In some myths all of the heavenly Jerusalem descends to earth, coming to rest on three or four mountains. In others, such as this myth, it is the Temple alone that descends upon the mountains.

      "commentary": "while the Temple itself is filled with God's presence, both His Bride, the Shekhinah , and His glory. In Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 21:4 it is said that God will bring three mountains, Sinai, Tabor, and Carmel, together and build the Temple on top of them. In 1860, Tzvi Hirsch Kalischer, an early Zionist, defined his anti-mythological view in Derishat Zion: \"God will not suddenly descend from on high and command his people to go forth. Neither will he send the Messiah from heaven in a twinkling of an eye, to sound the great trumpet for the exiles of Israel and gather them into Jerusalem. He will not surround the holy city with a wall of fire or cause the holy Temple to descend from heaven.\" Here we find a list of supernatural events that were traditionally expected to occur in the time of the Messiah, including the descent of the heavenly Temple. But Kalischer dismisses all of these, writing instead that \"the redemption will come through natural causes by human effort ... to gather the scattered of Israel into the Holy Land.\"",

      "commentary": "Some say that God will then bring the mountains of Sinai, Tabor, and Carmel together and rebuild the Temple upon their peak. That is the meaning of the verse And nations shall walk by your light , kings , by your shining radiance (Isa. 60:3). Then the Temple will sing aloud, and the mountains will answer the song. So too will Jerusalem serve as a beacon to all of the nations, and they will walk in her light. Others say that God will raise up the Temple from the dust and renew it, and its gates, which are buried in the earth, will rise up, every one in its place. And God will reestablish the Sanctuary, and rebuild the city of Jerusalem. Then the Shekhinah shall arise and shake off the dust and the Ingathering of the Exiles shall begin. One of the key events of the messianic era will be the rebuilding of the Temple. This is one of the requirements that must be fulfilled prior to the return of the Shekhinah from exile. It is understood that this Third Temple, of divine origin, will be eternal, and will never be destroyed. An extensive description of the future Temple is found at the end of the Book of Ezekiel, chapters 40-48, beginning with a vision: The hand of Yahiveh came upon me, and He brought me there . He brought me, in visions of God , to the Land of Israel, and He set me down on a very high mountain (Ezek. 40: 1-2). In one version of this myth from Pesikta de-Rav Kahana, it is said that God will bring three mountains together and build the future Temple there. In most other sources, the rebuilding of the Third Temple takes place in Jerusalem. And as soon as the Temple is rebuilt, the Shekhinah will return from Her exile at the time the Temple, Her home in the world, was destroyed. In Pesikta Rabbati 31:5, God describes the covenant between Himself and Israel, where both are responsible for bringing about the End of Days: \"My Torah is in your hands, and the End of Days in Mine. Each of us has need of the other. If you need Me to bring the time of redemption, I need you to keep My Torah so as to hasten the building of My Temple and Jerusalem. And just as it is impossible for Me to forget the time of redemption, so you must never forget the Torah.\"",

The image of the magical tree is well known in Jewish folk and rabbinic texts, although it is usually associated with the Garden of Eden, especially with the two trees in the center of the garden, the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge. The image of the tree is also closely associated with that of the Torah, because of the verse She is a tree of life to those who grasp her (Prov. 3:18).",
      "commentary": "Here the tree is associated with the building of the Third Temple, which will only take place at the time of the coming of the Messiah. This demonstrates an important parallel between the story of the Garden of Eden and the messianic era — in both enchanted trees can be found. Indeed, there is a direct parallel in Jewish myth between the prelapsarian world and the messianic era. Thus one function of the coming of the Messiah is to restore the world to its pre-fallen state. This parallel is an implicit part of the myth of the Ari. See \"The Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks,\" p. 122. The theme of healing leaves is found in world folklore. See, for example, \"The Wonderful Healing Leaves,\" a universal fairy tale of Jewish origin, in Elijah's Violin , pp. 163-168. This theme is found in Jewish lore as well.

      "content": "In the hour that Israel was exiled, the fathers of the world, along with the mothers, were raised from their graves in the Cave of Machpelah and brought up to the firmament and began a great mourning before God. God joined them from the highest heaven and said, \"Why are you mourning?\" They replied: \"Master of the Universe, what sins did our children commit that You did this to them? Are You not going to have mercy on them? Are You not going to show compassion?\" God replied, \"Because of their wickedness, they were punished by exile.\" The Fathers said, \"But will You remember them in their exile among the nations of the world, or will You become oblivious to them?\" God answered, \"I cannot now save them from their exile, but I swear by My name that I shall never forget them, and one day their exile shall come to an end.\" These words of God greatly comforted the fathers and mothers, and they returned and lay down in their tombs. That is why, when the Messiah comes, he will go to the Cave of Machpelah to wake them first.",
      "commentary": "Here the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their wives gather before God to plead for their children, Israel, who have been sent into exile. Because of their elevated roles, the patriarchs are able to speak their mind to God. In effect, they give voice to the sense of injustice felt among Jews in the Diaspora. The plea of the patriarchs and matriarchs moves God, who assures them that one day — the day the Messiah comes — their exile will come to an end. This myth finds its source in Jeremiah's vision or imagining of Rachel haunting her tomb and weeping for her exiled children: A cry is heard in Ramah — wailing , bitter weeping — Rachel weeping for her children. She refuses to be comforted for her children , who are gone (Jer. 31:15). (According to 1 Sam. 10:2, Rachel's tomb was located near Ramah.) Indeed, Jeremiah's account of Rachel weeping is the biblical source for all subsequent myths about biblical figures reappearing to comfort Israel. This myth is also parallel to those found in the Zohar in which the Shekhinah, the Bride of God, confronts God over the destruction of the Temple and the exile of Israel. This myth also explains why the patriarchs and matriarchs will be the first to be resurrected in the messianic era. In the version of this myth in Seder Gan Eden , there is a less consoling ending. The angel Michael, the prince of Israel, weeps in a loud voice, \"Why, O Lord , do you stand aloof\" (Ps. 10:1). See the following myth, \"Waking the Fathers,\" as well as \"The Patriarchs Seek to Comfort Jerusalem,\" p. 420.",

      "content": "Why were the patriarchs buried in the Land of Israel? Because the dead of the Land will be the first to come to life in the days of the Messiah. In the hour that God crowns the Messiah, Israel will say to him: \"Go and bring the glad tidings to those who sleep in the Cave of Machpelah, so that they shall be the first to arise/' Then the Messiah will go to the Cave of Machpelah and say to the Fathers: \"Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, arise! You have slept long enough.\" And they will reply and say, \"Who is it who uncovers the dust from our eyes?\" And he will reply, \"I am the Messiah of the Lord. The hour of salvation is near.\" And they will answer, \"If that is really so, then go to Adam, the first man, and bring the tidings to him, so that he should be the first to arise.\" Then the Messiah will go to Adam and say, \"Arise, you have slept enough!\" And Adam will reply, \"Who is this who drives the sleep from my eyes?\" And he will reply, \"I am the Messiah of the Lord, one of your descendants.\" At that instant Adam will stand up, along with his generation, and Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the righteous and all the tribes and all generations from the beginning of time will arise and chant psalms and songs of jubilation. Tradition holds that the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, known as the Avot or Fathers, and their wives, are buried in the Cave of Machpelah in Hebron. Midrashic legend also recounts that Adam and Eve are buried there. The initiation of the messianic era will herald the resurrection of the dead, beginning with Adam, the first man, and the patriarchs.",
      "commentary": "This myth is almost certainly based on a talmudic one (B. BM 85b) about the visits of Elijah to the synagogue of Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi. Elijah is the key figure in heralding the Messiah, as it is said that he will blow the great shofar that announces his coming. This talmudic tale sets the pattern for the waking of the patriarchs at the time of the coming of the Messiah. See \"Forcing the End,\" p. 496. The previous myth, \"The Pleading of the Fathers,\" also explains why the patriarchs will be the first to be awakened when the Messiah comes.",

The first Messiah is a son of Joseph, and the second a son of David. The son of Joseph, whom all will recognize as the Tzaddik of his generation, will sacrifice his life so that the footsteps of the Messiah might be heard, and the land shall mourn. The second Messiah, the son of David, makes his home in Paradise, in a heavenly palace, where he waits for signs that the time for the coming of the Messiah has arrived. Each Messiah has a separate role. Messiah, the son of David, will redeem the Shekhinah, along with all the holy sparks that were scattered during the six days of Creation. Messiah, the son of Joseph, will redeem the souls of those who fell through sin and transgression, and were transmigrated into inanimate objects, vegetables, animals, and humans. He will free the souls of the righteous that were transmigrated into fish, and the souls of the righteous will be raised up. There are two primary conceptions of the Messiah in Judaism: one, the earthly Messiah, a descendant of Joseph, who is the righteous one of his generation; the other, a descendant of David, who serves as an instrument of salvation. Eventually these two conceptions were combined in a single myth in which the first, earthly Messiah, paves the way for the divine one.",

Kafka's paradoxical explanation of when the Messiah will come is so intriguing that it deserves a place in this collection of Jewish myths. It also reflects traditional Jewish teachings about the Messiah. The coming of the Messiah represents the initiation of the End of Days, the messianic era in which all of existence will be transformed, a return to a prelapsarian condition or a kind of heaven on earth. For this reason, the arrival of the Messiah is not important in itself; rather, it is the transformation that accompanies the arrival that matters. This is one way of understanding Kafka's comment that \"The Messiah will not come until he is no longer needed.\"",

And whoever hears a midrash from the mouth of the Messiah will never forget it, for God will reveal Himself in that House of Study and pour out His Holy Spirit upon all those who walk in the world. One of the highest honors among rabbis was to be the head of a yeshivah, a rabbinic academy. Here it is said that in the messianic era, the Messiah will have his own yeshivah, where he teaches both Halakhah (law) and Aggadah (non-legal teachings, often legends). (It is interesting to note that Aggadah is mentioned first, demonstrating its importance among the Yemenite Jews.) All Jews among the living will come to hear him, and the sound of his voice will resurrect the dead. This is a word-oriented form of initiating the messianic era, with the supernatural voice of the Messiah bringing about the resurrection. Note the central role given to Elijah, to interpret the teachings of the Messiah. This confirms the rabbis' central concept of the importance of commentary",

In that hour the Messiah will come and bring comfort to Israel.\" Thus the one known as the Messiah is actually two, for the Messiah is none other than Moses and Elijah come together as one. That is how God's vow to Moses will be fulfilled. Moses and Elijah are each models for the Messiah. For the Samaritans, Moses was virtually regarded as a messianic figure. Rabbinic concern that the role of Moses might come to transcend that of a prophet and take on messianic attributes may have been the reason that the role of Moses in the Exodus was almost entirely omitted from the Passover Seder. (Byron Sherwin suggests that this omission was triggered by the early Christian description of Jesus as the \"new Moses.\") As for Elijah, his messianic role is explicit — it is said that he will herald the coming of the Messiah, and will blow the shofar (ram's horn) from the ram that Abraham sacrificed on Mount Moriah in place of Isaac. (Moses is said to have blown the ram's other hom at Mount Sinai.) Thus, together Moses and Elijah have all of the attributes of the Messiah, and this radical midrash from Deuteronomy Kabbah goes a step further, stating that the Messiah will be Moses and Elijah \"come together as one,\" suggesting that they will be reincarnated as a single figure.",

Jerusalem will not be rebuilt until all the exiles have been brought back. Then God will rebuild it and never destroy it again.

      "content": "In Rome there is a marble sculpture of a beautiful woman that was not created by human hands. Some say it was brought into being during the six days of Creation. It is also said that Satan lusts after it, and one day he will descend to earth, go to Rome, and copulate with it. And the stone will become pregnant. After nine months it will burst open and a male child will emerge in the shape of a man with two heads, twelve cubits high, his eyes set a span apart, crooked and bloodshot, his hair red, his feet green, with six fingers on each hand. That is how Armilus, the tempter, will be born.",
      "commentary": "This is a grotesque myth about the birth of Armilus, who plays the role of the AntiChrist in Jewish messianic mythology. Armilus is normally explained as a distortion of Romulus, who symbolizes Rome, which also symbolizes Christianity. This may suggest that Christianity is viewed in this myth as a monster born from Judaism. The alluring statue that Satan is predicted to copulate with is said, in some sources, to have been created during the six days of Creation. That adds a new dimension to the myth, as it indicates that God was the sculptor who created it, a fact that Satan surely knows. His copulation with the statue, from this perspective, is not an act of lust so much as an act of hostility toward God. And the product is a virtual Anti-Christ, Armilus, who, it is said, will conquer Israel before finally being defeated by the Messiah. This must also be seen as an allegory about the worship of idols, which, no matter how alluring, are made of stone. In some versions of this myth it is Satan who copulates with the statue, while in others her lovers are described as the \"sons of Belial\" (a biblical term for \"worthless people\"), who also succeed in impregnating her. In both cases, a grotesque male in the form of a grown man with two heads will emerge. This mythic origin of Armilus explains his supernaturally evil powers, especially in the version in which Satan is his father. The statue of the woman in this myth echoes the Greek myth of Niobe, whom Zeus turned into a statue. It is said that statue can be seen weeping copiously, while it is said of the statue in the myth of Armilus that it will become pregnant and will give birth. See Greek Myths by Robert Graves, 77c.

In its structure, this myth is similar to that of Moses standing before the Throne of Glory and asking to see Rabbi Akiba, a thousand years in the future (B. Shabbat 88b-89a and B. Menahot 29b). In both cases, God has no difficulty in revealing these mysteries. The fate that Satan describes, of being swallowed up in Gehenna, derives from the verse He will destroy death forever (Isa. 25:8). While some sources describe Satan as having been created out of the fires of hell, here it is those fires that rise up and destroy him when, on the last day, Satan tries to renew his rebellion against God.

      "content": "In the beginning, two thousand years before the heaven and the earth, seven things were created: the Torah written with black fire on white fire, and lying in the lap of God; the Divine Throne, erected in the heaven which later was over the heads of the Hayyot; Paradise on the right side of God, Hell on the left side; the Celestial Sanctuary directly in front of God, having a jewel on its altar graven with the Name of the Messiah, and a Voice that cries aloud, \"Return, ye children of men.\" When God resolved upon the creation of the world, He took counsel with the Torah. Her advice was this: \"O Lord, a king without an army and without courtiers and attendants hardly deserves the name of king, for none is nigh to express the homage due to him.\" The answer pleased God exceedingly. Thus did He teach all earthly kings, by His Divine example, to undertake naught without first consulting advisers. The advice of the Torah was given with some reservations. She was skeptical about the value of an earthly world, on account of the sinfulness of men, who would be sure to disregard her precepts. But God dispelled her doubts. He told her, that repentance had been created long before, and sinners would have the opportunity of mending their ways. Besides, the Temple service would be invested with atoning power, and Paradise and hell were intended to do duty as reward and punishment. Finally, the Messiah was appointed to bring salvation, which would put an end to all sinfulness. Nor is this world inhabited by man the first of things earthly created by God. He made several worlds before ours, but He destroyed them all, because He was pleased with none until He created ours. But even this last world would have had no permanence, if God had executed His original plan of ruling it according to the principle of strict justice. It was only when He saw that justice by itself would undermine the world that He associated mercy with justice, and made them to rule jointly. Thus, from the beginning of all things prevailed Divine goodness, without which nothing could have continued to exist. If not for it, the myriads of evil spirits had soon put an end to the generations of men. But the goodness of God has ordained, that in every Nisan, at the time of the spring equinox, the seraphim shall approach the world of spirits, and intimidate them so that they fear to do harm to men. Again, if God in His goodness had not given protection to the weak, the tame animals would have been extirpated long ago by the wild animals. In Tammuz, at the time of the summer solstice, when the strength of behemot is at its height, he roars so loud that all the animals hear it, and for a whole year they are affrighted and timid, and their acts become less ferocious than their nature is. Again, in Tishri, at the time of the autumnal equinox, the great bird ziz flaps his wings and utters his cry, so that the birds of prey, the eagles and the vultures, blench, and they fear to swoop down upon the others and annihilate them in their greed. And, again, were it not for the goodness of God, the vast number of big fish had quickly put an end to the little ones. But at the time of the winter solstice, in the month of Tebet, the sea grows restless, for then leviathan spouts up water, and the big fish become uneasy. They restrain their appetite, and the little ones escape their rapacity. Finally, the goodness of God manifests itself in the preservation of His people Israel. It could not have survived the enmity of the Gentiles, if God had not appointed protectors for it, the archangels Michael and Gabriel. Whenever Israel disobeys God, and is accused of misdemeanors by the angels of the other nations, he is defended by his designated guardians, with such good result that the other angels conceive fear of them. Once the angels of the other nations are terrified, the nations themselves venture not to carry out their wicked designs against Israel. That the goodness of God may rule on earth as in heaven, the Angels of Destruction are assigned a place at the far end of the heavens, from which they may never stir, while the Angels of Mercy encircle the Throne of God, at His behest.",

      "title": "The Alphabet",
      "content": "When God was about to create the world by His word, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet descended from the terrible and august crown of God whereon they were engraved with a pen of flaming fire. They stood round about God, and one after the other spake and entreated, \"Create the world through me!\" The first to step forward was the letter Taw. It said: \"O Lord of the world! May it be Thy will to create Thy world through me, seeing that it is through me that Thou wilt give the Torah to Israel by the hand of Moses, as it is written, 'Moses commanded us the Torah.'\" The Holy One, blessed be He, made reply, and said, \"No!\" Taw asked, \"Why not?\" and God answered: \"Because in days to come I shall place thee as a sign of death upon the foreheads of men.\" As soon as Taw heard these words issue from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, it retired from His presence disappointed. The Shin then stepped forward, and pleaded: \"O Lord of the world, create Thy world through me: seeing that Thine own name Shaddai begins with me.\" Unfortunately, it is also the first letter of Shaw, lie, and of Sheker, falsehood, and that incapacitated it. Resh had no better luck. It was pointed out that it was the initial letter of Ra', wicked, and Rasha' evil, and after that the distinction it enjoys of being the first letter in the Name of God, Rahum, the Merciful, counted for naught. The Kof was rejected, because Kelalah, curse, outweighs the advantage of being the first in Kadosh, the Holy One. In vain did Zadde call attention to Zaddik, the Righteous One; there was Zarot, the misfortunes of Israel, to testify against it. Pe had Podeh, redeemer, to its credit, but Pesha: transgression, reflected dishonor upon it. 'Ain was declared unfit, because, though it begins 'Anawah, humility, it performs the same service for 'Erwah, immorality. Samek said: \"O Lord, may it be Thy will to begin the creation with me, for Thou art called Samek, after me, the Upholder of all that fall.\" But God said: \"Thou art needed in the place in which thou art; thou must continue to uphold all that fall.\" Nun introduces Ner, \"the lamp of the Lord,\" which is \"the spirit of men,\" but it also introduces Ner, \"the lamp of the wicked,\" which will be put out by God. Mem starts Melek, king, one of the titles of God. As it is the first letter of Mehumah, confusion, as well, it had no chance of accomplishing its desire. The claim of Lamed bore its refutation within itself. It advanced the argument that it was the first letter of Luhot, the celestial tables for the Ten Commandments; it forgot that the tables were shivered in pieces by Moses. Kaf was sure of victory Kisseh, the throne of God, Kabod, His honor, and Keter, His crown, all begin with it. God had to remind it that He would smite together His hands, Kaf, in despair over the misfortunes of Israel. Yod at first sight seemed the appropriate letter for the beginning of creation, on account of its association with Yah, God, if only Yezer ha-Ra' the evil inclination, had not happened to begin with it, too. Tet is identified with Tob, the good. However, the truly good is not in this world; it belongs to the world to come. Het is the first letter of Hanun, the Gracious One; but this advantage is offset by its place in the word for sin, Hattat. Zain suggests Zakor, remembrance, but it is itself the word for weapon, the doer of mischief. Waw and He compose the Ineffable Name of God; they are therefore too exalted to be pressed into the service of the mundane world. If Dalet had stood only for Dabar, the Divine Word, it would have been used, but it stands also for Din, justice, and under the rule of law without love the world would have fallen to ruin. Finally, in spite of reminding one of Gadol, great, Gimel would not do, because Gemul, retribution, starts with it. After the claims of all these letters had been disposed of, Bet stepped before the Holy One, blessed be He, and pleaded before Him: \"O Lord of the world! May it be Thy will to create Thy world through me, seeing that all the dwellers in the world give praise daily unto Thee through me, as it is said, 'Blessed be the Lord forever. Amen, and Amen.'\" The Holy One, blessed be He, at once granted the petition of Bet. He said, \"Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord.\" And He created His world through Bet, as it is said, \"Bereshit God created the heaven and the earth.\" The only letter that had refrained from urging its claims was the modest Alef, and God rewarded it later for its humility by giving it the first place in the Decalogue.",

      "id": "ginzberg-v1-the-first-day",
      "title": "The First Day",
      "content": "On the first day of creation God produced ten things: the heavens and the earth, Tohu and Bohu, light and darkness, wind and water, the duration of the day and the duration of the night. Though the heavens and the earth consist of entirely different elements, they were yet created as a unit, \"like the pot and its cover.\" The heavens were fashioned from the light of God's garment, and the earth from the snow under the Divine Throne. Tohu is a green band which encompasses the whole world, and dispenses darkness, and Bohu consists of stones in the abyss, the producers of the waters. The light created at the very beginning is not the same as the light emitted by the sun, the moon, and the stars, which appeared only on the fourth day. The light of the first day was of a sort that would have enabled man to see the world at a glance from one end to the other. Anticipating the wickedness of the sinful generations of the deluge and the Tower of Babel, who were unworthy to enjoy the blessing of such light, God concealed it, but in the world to come it will appear to the pious in all its pristine glory. Several heavens were created, seven in fact, each to serve a purpose of its own. The first, the one visible to man, has no function except that of covering up the light during the night time; therefore it disappears every morning. The planets are fastened to the second of the heavens; in the third the manna is made for the pious in the hereafter; the fourth contains the celestial Jerusalem together with the Temple, in which Michael ministers as high priest, and offers the souls of the pious as sacrifices. In the fifth heaven, the angel hosts reside, and sing the praise of God, though only during the night, for by day it is the task of Israel on earth to give glory to God on high. The sixth heaven is an uncanny spot; there originate most of the trials and visitations ordained for the earth and its inhabitants. Snow lies heaped up there and hail; there are lofts full of noxious dew, magazines stocked with storms, and cellars holding reserves of smoke. Doors of fire separate these celestial chambers, which are under the supervision of the archangel Metatron. Their pernicious contents defiled the heavens until David's time. The pious king prayed God to purge His exalted dwelling of whatever was pregnant with evil; it was not becoming that such things should exist near the Merciful One. Only then they were removed to the earth. The seventh heaven, on the other hand, contains naught but what is good and beautiful: right, justice, and mercy, the storehouses of life, peace, and blessing, the souls of the pious, the souls and spirits of unborn generations, the dew with which God will revive the dead on the resurrection day, and, above all, the Divine Throne, surrounded by the seraphim, the ofanim, the holy Hayyot, and the ministering angels. Corresponding to the seven heavens, God created seven earths, each separated from the next by five layers. Over the lowest earth, the seventh, called Erez, lie in succession the abyss, the Tohu, the Bohu, a sea, and waters. Then the sixth earth is reached, the Adamah, the scene of the magnificence of God. In the same way the Adamah is separated from the fifth earth, the Arka, which contains Gehenna, and Sha'are Mawet, and Sha'are Zalmawet, and Beer Shahat, and Tit ha-Yawen, and Abaddon, and Sheol, and there the souls of the wicked are guarded by the Angels of Destruction. In the same way Arka is followed by Harabah, the dry, the place of brooks and streams in spite of its name, as the next, called Yabbashah, the mainland, contains the rivers and the springs. Tebel, the second earth, is the first mainland inhabited by living creatures, three hundred and sixty-five species, all essentially different from those of our own earth. Some have human heads set on the body of a lion, or a serpent, or an ox; others have human bodies topped by the head of one of these animals. Besides, Tebel is inhabited by human beings with two heads and four hands and feet, in fact with all their organs doubled excepting only the trunk. It happens sometimes that the parts of these double persons quarrel with each other, especially while eating and drinking, when each claims the best and largest portions for himself. This species of mankind is distinguished for great piety, another difference between it and the inhabitants of our earth. Our own earth is called Heled, and, like the others, it is separated from the Tebel by an abyss, the Tohu, the Bohu, a sea, and waters. Thus one earth rises above the other, from the first to the seventh, and over the seventh earth the heavens are vaulted, from the first to the seventh, the last of them attached to the arm of God. The seven heavens form a unity, the seven kinds of earth form a unity, and the heavens and the earth together also form a unity. When God made our present heavens and our present earth, \"the new heavens and the new earth\" were also brought forth, yea, and the hundred and ninety-six thousand worlds which God created unto His Own glory. It takes five hundred years to walk from the earth to the heavens, and from one end of a heaven to the other, and also from one heaven to the next, and it takes the same length of time to travel from the east to the west, or from the south to the north. Of all this vast world only one-third is inhabited, the other two-thirds being equally divided between water and waste desert land. Beyond the inhabited parts to the east is Paradise with its seven divisions, each assigned to the pious of a certain degree. The ocean is situated to the west, and it is dotted with islands upon islands, inhabited by many different peoples. Beyond it, in turn, are the boundless steppes full of serpents and scorpions, and destitute of every sort of vegetation, whether herbs or trees. To the north are the supplies of hell-fire, of snow, hail, smoke, ice, darkness, and windstorms, and in that vicinity sojourn all sorts of devils, demons, and malign spirits. Their dwelling-place is a great stretch of land, it would take five hundred years to traverse it. Beyond lies hell. To the south is the chamber containing reserves of fire, the cave of smoke, and the forge of blasts and hurricanes. Thus it comes that the wind blowing from the south brings heat and sultriness to the earth. Were it not for the angel Ben Nez, the Winged, who keeps the south wind back with his pinions, the world would be consumed. Besides, the fury of its blast is tempered by the north wind, which always appears as moderator, whatever other wind may be blowing. In the east, the west, and the south, heaven and earth touch each other, but the north God left unfinished, that any man who announced himself as a god might be set the task of supplying the deficiency, and stand convicted as a pretender. The construction of the earth was begun at the centre, with the foundation stone of the Temple, the Eben Shetiyah, for the Holy Land is at the central point of the surface of the earth, Jerusalem is at the central point of Palestine, and the Temple is situated at the centre of the Holy City. In the sanctuary itself the Hekal is the centre, and the holy Ark occupies the centre of the Hekal, built on the foundation stone, which thus is at the centre of the earth. Thence issued the first ray of light, piercing to the Holy Land, and from there illuminating the whole earth. The creation of the world, however, could not take place until God had banished the ruler of the dark. \"Retire,\" God said to him, \"for I desire to create the world by means of light.\" Only after the light had been fashioned, darkness arose, the light ruling in the sky, the darkness on the earth. The power of God displayed itself not only in the creation of the world of things, but equally in the limitations which He imposed upon each. The heavens and the earth stretched themselves out in length and breadth as though they aspired to infinitude, and it required the word of God to call a halt to their encroachments.",

      "id": "ginzberg-v1-the-second-day",
      "title": "The Second Day",
      "content": "On the second day God brought forth four creations, the firmament, hell, fire, and the angels. The firmament is not the same as the heavens of the first day. It is the crystal stretched forth over the heads of the Hayyot, from which the heavens derive their light, as the earth derives its light from the sun. This firmament saves the earth from being engulfed by the waters of the heavens; it forms the partition between the waters above and the waters below. It was made to crystallize into the solid it is by the heavenly fire, which broke its bounds, and condensed the surface of the firmament. Thus fire made a division between the celestial and the terrestrial at the time of creation, as it did at the revelation on Mount Sinai. The firmament is not more than three fingers thick, nevertheless it divides two such heavy bodies as the waters below, which are the foundations for the nether world, and the waters above, which are the foundations for the seven heavens, the Divine Throne, and the abode of the angels. The separation of the waters into upper and lower waters was the only act of the sort done by God in connection with the work of creation. All other acts were unifying. It therefore caused some difficulties. When God commanded, \"Let the waters be gathered together, unto one place, and let the dry land appear,\" certain parts refused to obey. They embraced each other all the more closely. In His wrath at the waters, God determined to let the whole of creation resolve itself into chaos again. He summoned the Angel of the Face, and ordered him to destroy the world. The angel opened his eyes wide, and scorching fires and thick clouds rolled forth from them, while he cried out, \"He who divides the Red Sea in sunder!\"—and the rebellious waters stood. The all, however, was still in danger of destruction. Then began the singer of God's praises: \"O Lord of the world, in days to come Thy creatures will sing praises without end to Thee, they will bless Thee boundlessly, and they will glorify Thee without measure. Thou wilt set Abraham apart from all mankind as Thine own; one of his sons Thou wilt call 'My first-born'; and his descendants will take the yoke of Thy kingdom upon themselves. In holiness and purity Thou wilt bestow Thy Torah upon them, with the words, 'I am the Lord your God,' whereunto they will make answer, 'All that God hath spoken we will do.' And now I beseech Thee, have pity upon Thy world, destroy it not, for if Thou destroyest it, who will fulfil Thy will?\" God was pacified; He withdrew the command ordaining the destruction of the world, but the waters He put under the mountains, to remain there forever. The objection of the lower waters to division and Separation was not their only reason for rebelling. The waters had been the first to give praise to God, and when their separation into upper and lower was decreed, the waters above rejoiced, saying, \"Blessed are we who are privileged to abide near our Creator and near His Holy Throne.\" Jubilating thus, they flew upward, and uttered song and praise to the Creator of the world. Sadness fell upon the waters below. They lamented: \"Woe unto us, we have not been found worthy to dwell in the presence of God, and praise Him together with our companions.\" Therefore they attempted to rise upward, until God repulsed them, and pressed them under the earth. Yet they were not left unrewarded for their loyalty. Whenever the waters above desire to give praise to God, they must first seek permission from the waters below. The second day of creation was an untoward day in more than the one respect that it introduced a breach where before there had been nothing but unity; for it was the day that saw also the creation of hell. Therefore God could not say of this day as of the others, that He \"saw that it was good.\" A division may be necessary, but it cannot be called good, and hell surely does not deserve the attribute of good. Hell has seven divisions, one beneath the other. They are called Sheol, Abaddon, Beer Shahat, Tit ha-Yawen, Sha'are Mawet, Sha'are Zalmawet: and Gehenna. It requires three hundred years to traverse the height, or the width, or the depth of each division, and it would take six thousand three hundred years to go over a tract of land equal in extent to the seven divisions. Each of the seven divisions in turn has seven subdivisions, and in each compartment there are seven rivers of fire and seven of hail. The width of each is one thousand ells, its depth one thousand, and its length three hundred, and they flow one from the other, and are supervised by ninety thousand Angels of Destruction. There are, besides, in every compartment seven thousand caves, in every cave there are seven thousand crevices, and in every crevice seven thousand scorpions. Every scorpion has three hundred rings, and in every ring seven thousand pouches of venom, from which flow seven rivers of deadly poison. If a man handles it, he immediately bursts, every limb is torn from his body, his bowels are cleft asunder, and he falls upon his face. There are also five different kinds of fire in hell. One devours and absorbs, another devours and does not absorb, while the third absorbs and does not devour, and there is still another fire, which neither devours nor absorbs, and furthermore a fire which devours fire. There are coals big as mountains, and coals big as hills, and coals as large as the Dead Sea, and coals like huge stones, and there are rivers of pitch and sulphur flowing and seething like live coals. The third creation of the second day was the angel hosts, both the ministering angels and the angels of praise. The reason they had not been called into being on the first day was, lest men believe that the angels assisted God in the creation of the heavens and the earth. The angels that are fashioned from fire have forms of fire, but only so long as they remain in heaven. When they descend to earth, to do the bidding of God here below, either they are changed into wind, or they assume the guise of men. There are ten ranks or degrees among the angels. The most exalted in rank are those surrounding the Divine Throne on all sides, to the right, to the left, in front, and behind, under the leadership of the archangels Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, and Raphael. All the celestial beings praise God with the words, \"Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts,\" but men take precedence of the angels herein. They may not begin their song of praise until the earthly beings have brought their homage to God. Especially Israel is preferred to the angels. When they encircle the Divine Throne in the form of fiery mountains and flaming hills, and attempt to raise their voices in adoration of the Creator, God silences them with the words, \"Keep quiet until I have heard the songs, praises, prayers, and sweet melodies of Israel.\" Accordingly, the ministering angels and all the other celestial hosts wait until the last tones of Israel's doxologies rising aloft from earth have died away, and then they proclaim in a loud voice, \"Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts.\" When the hour for the glorification of God by the angels draws nigh, the august Divine herald, the angel Sham'iel, steps to the windows of the lowest heaven to hearken to the songs, prayers, and praises that ascend from the synagogues and the houses of learning, and when they are finished, he announces the end to the angels in all the heavens. The ministering angels, those who come in contact with the sublunary world, now repair to their chambers to take their purification bath. They dive into a stream of fire and flame seven times, and three hundred and sixty-five times they examine themselves carefully, to make sure that no taint clings to their bodies. Only then they feel privileged to mount the fiery ladder and join the angels of the seventh heaven, and surround the throne of God with Hashmal and all the holy Hayyot. Adorned with millions of fiery crowns, arrayed in fiery garments, all the angels in unison, in the same words, and with the same melody, intone songs of praise to God.",

      "title": "The Third Day",
      "content": "Up to this time the earth was a plain, and wholly covered with water. Scarcely had the words of God, \"Let the waters be gathered together,\" made themselves heard, when mountains appeared all over and hills, and the water collected in the deep-lying basins. But the water was recalcitrant, it resisted the order to occupy the lowly spots, and threatened to overflow the earth, until God forced it back into the sea, and encircled the sea with sand. Now, whenever the water is tempted to transgress its bounds, it beholds the sand, and recoils. The waters did but imitate their chief Rahab, the Angel of the Sea, who rebelled at the creation of the world. God had commanded Rahab to take in the water. But he refused, saying, \"I have enough.\" The punishment for his disobedience was death. His body rests in the depths of the sea, the water dispelling the foul odor that emanates from it. The main creation of the third day was the realm of plants, the terrestrial plants as well as the plants of Paradise. First of all the cedars of Lebanon and the other great trees were made. In their pride at having been put first, they shot up high in the air. They considered themselves the favored among plants. Then God spake, \"I hate arrogance and pride, for I alone am exalted, and none beside,\" and He created the iron on the same day, the substance with which trees are felled down. The trees began to weep, and when God asked the reason of their tears, they said: \"We cry because Thou hast created the iron to uproot us therewith. All the while we had thought ourselves the highest of the earth, and now the iron, our destroyer, has been called into existence.\" God replied: \"You yourselves will furnish the axe with a handle. Without your assistance the iron will not be able to do aught against you.\" The command to bear seed after their kind was given to the trees alone. But the various sorts of grass reasoned, that if God had not desired divisions according to classes, He would not have instructed the trees to bear fruit after their kind with the seed thereof in it, especially as trees are inclined of their own accord to divide themselves into species. The grasses therefore reproduced themselves also after their kinds. This prompted the exclamation of the Prince of the World, \"Let the glory of the Lord endure forever; let the Lord rejoice in His works.\" The most important work done on the third day was the creation of Paradise. Two gates of carbuncle form the entrance to Paradise, and sixty myriads of ministering angels keep watch over them. Each of these angels shines with the lustre of the heavens. When the just man appears before the gates, the clothes in which he was buried are taken off him, and the angels array him in seven garments of clouds of glory, and place upon his head two crowns, one of precious stones and pearls, the other of gold of Parvaim, and they put eight myrtles in his hand, and they utter praises before him and say to him, \"Go thy way, and eat thy bread with joy.\" And they lead him to a place full of rivers, surrounded by eight hundred kinds of roses and myrtles. Each one has a canopy according to his merits, and under it flow four rivers, one of milk, the other of balsam, the third of wine, and the fourth of honey. Every canopy is overgrown by a vine of gold, and thirty pearls hang from it, each of them shining like Venus. Under each canopy there is a table of precious stones and pearls, and sixty angels stand at the head of every just man, saying unto him: \"Go and eat with joy of the honey, for thou hast busied thyself with the Torah, and she is sweeter than honey, and drink of the wine preserved in the grape since the six days of creation, for thou hast busied thyself with the Torah, and she is compared to wine.\" The least fair of the just is beautiful as Joseph and Rabbi Johanan, and as the grains of a silver pomegranate upon which fall the rays of the sun. There is no light, \"for the light of the righteous is the shining light.\" And they undergo four transformations every day, passing through four states. In the first the righteous is changed into a child. He enters the division for children, and tastes the joys of childhood. Then he is changed into a youth, and enters the division for the youths, with whom he enjoys the delights of youth. Next he becomes an adult, in the prime of life, and he enters the division of men, and enjoys the pleasures of manhood. Finally, he is changed into an old man. He enters the division for the old, and enjoys the pleasures of age. There are eighty myriads of trees in every corner of Paradise, the meanest among them choicer than all the spice trees. In every corner there are sixty myriads of angels singing with sweet voices, and the tree of life stands in the middle and shades the whole of Paradise. It has fifteen thousand tastes, each different from the other, and the perfumes thereof vary likewise. Over it hang seven clouds of glory, and winds blow upon it from all four sides, so that its odor is wafted from one end of the world to the other. Underneath sit the scholars and explain the Torah. Over each of them two canopies are spread, one of stars, the other of sun and moon, and a curtain of clouds of glory separates the one canopy from the other. Beyond Paradise begins Eden, containing three hundred and ten worlds and seven compartments for seven different classes of the pious. In the first are \"the martyr victims of the government,\" like Rabbi Akiba and his colleagues; in the second those who were drowned; in the third Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai and his disciples; in the fourth those who were carried off in the cloud of glory; in the fifth the penitents, who occupy a place which even a perfectly pious man cannot obtain; in the sixth are the youths who have not tasted of sin in their lives; in the seventh are those poor who studied Bible and Mishnah, and led a life of self-respecting decency. And God sits in the midst of them and expounds the Torah to them. As for the seven divisions of Paradise, each of them is twelve myriads of miles in width and twelve myriads of miles in length. In the first division dwell the proselytes who embraced Judaism of their own free will, not from compulsion. The walls are of glass and the wainscoting of cedar. The prophet Obadiah, himself a proselyte, is the overseer of this first division. The second division is built of silver, and the wainscoting thereof is of cedar. Here dwell those who have repented, and Manasseh, the penitent son of Hezekiah, presides over them. The third division is built of silver and gold. Here dwell Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the Israelites who came out of Egypt, and the whole generation that lived in the desert. Also David is there, together with all his sons except Absalom, one of them, Chileab, still alive. And all the kings of Judah are there, with the exception of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, who presides in the second division, over the penitents. Moses and Aaron preside over the third division. Here are precious vessels of silver and gold and jewels and canopies and beds and thrones and lamps, of gold, of precious stones, and of pearls, the best of everything there is in heaven. The fourth division is built of beautiful rubies, and its wainscoting is of olive wood. Here dwell the perfect and the steadfast in faith, and their wainscoting is of olive wood, because their lives were bitter as olives to them. The fifth division is built of silver and gold and refined gold, and the finest of gold and glass and bdellium, and through the midst of it flows the river Gihon. The wainscoting is of silver and gold, and a perfume breathes through it more exquisite than the perfume of Lebanon. The coverings of the silver and gold beds are made of purple and blue, woven by Eve, and of scarlet and the hair of goats, woven by angels. Here dwells the Messiah on a palanquin made of the wood of Lebanon, \"the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom of gold, the seat of it purple.\" With him is Elijah. He takes the head of Messiah, and places it in his bosom, and says to him, \"Be quiet, for the end draweth nigh.\" On every Monday and Thursday and on Sabbaths and holidays, the Patriarchs come to him, and the twelve sons of Jacob, and Moses, Aaron, David, Solomon, and all the kings of Israel and of Judah, and they weep with him and comfort him, and say unto him, \"Be quiet and put trust in thy Creator, for the end draweth nigh.\" Also Korah and his company, and Dathan, Abiram, and Absalom come to him on every Wednesday, and ask him: \"How long before the end comes full of wonders? When wilt thou bring us life again, and from the abysses of the earth lift us?\" The Messiah answers them, \"Go to your fathers and ask them\"; and when they hear this, they are ashamed, and do not ask their fathers. In the sixth division dwell those who died in performing a pious act, and in the seventh division those who died from illness inflicted as an expiation for the sins of Israel.",

      "title": "The Fourth Day",
      "content": "The fourth day of creation produced the sun, the moon, and the stars. These heavenly spheres were not actually fashioned on this day; they were created on the first day, and merely were assigned their places in the heavens on the fourth. At first the sun and the moon enjoyed equal powers and prerogatives. The moon spoke to God, and said: \"O Lord, why didst Thou create the world with the letter Bet?\" God replied: \"That it might be made known unto My creatures that there are two worlds.\" The moon: \"O Lord: which of the two worlds is the larger, this world or the world to come?\" God: \"The world to come is the larger.\" The moon: \"O Lord, Thou didst create two worlds, a greater and a lesser world; Thou didst create the heaven and the earth, the heaven exceeding the earth; Thou didst create fire and water, the water stronger than the fire, because it can quench the fire; and now Thou hast created the sun and the moon, and it is becoming that one of them should be greater than the other.\" Then spake God to the moon: \"I know well, thou wouldst have me make Thee greater than the sun. As a punishment I decree that thou mayest keep but one-sixtieth of thy light.\" The moon made supplication: \"Shall I be punished so severely for having spoken a single word?\" God relented: \"In the future world I will restore thy light, so that thy light may again be as the light of the sun.\" The moon was not yet satisfied. \"O Lord,\" she said, \"and the light of the sun, how great will it be in that day?\" Then the wrath of God was once more enkindled: \"What, thou still plottest against the sun? As thou livest, in the world to come his light shall be sevenfold the light he now sheds.\" The Sun runs his course like a bridegroom. He sits upon a throne with a garland on his head. Ninety-six angels accompany him on his daily journey, in relays of eight every hour, two to the left of him, and two to the right, two before Him, and two behind. Strong as he is, he could complete his course from south to north in a single instant, but three hundred and sixty-five angels restrain him by means of as many grappling-irons. Every day one looses his hold, and the sun must thus spend three hundred and sixty-five days on his course. The progress of the sun in his circuit is an uninterrupted song of praise to God. And this song alone makes his motion possible. Therefore, when Joshua wanted to bid the sun stand still, he had to command him to be silent. His song of praise hushed, the sun stood still. The sun is double-faced; one face, of fire, is directed toward the earth, and one of hail, toward heaven, to cool off the prodigious heat that streams from the other face, else the earth would catch afire. In winter the sun turns his fiery face upward, and thus the cold is produced. When the sun descends in the west in the evening, he dips down into the ocean and takes a bath, his fire is extinguished, and therefore he dispenses neither light nor warmth during the night. But as soon as he reaches the east in the morning, he laves himself in a stream of flame, which imparts warmth and light to him, and these he sheds over the earth. In the same way the moon and the stars take a bath in a stream of hail before they enter upon their service for the night. When the sun and the moon are ready to start upon their round of duties, they appear before God, and beseech him to relieve them of their task, so that they may be spared the sight of sinning mankind. Only upon compulsion they proceed with their daily course. Coming from the presence of God, they are blinded by the radiance in the heavens, and they cannot find their way. God, therefore, shoots off arrows, by the glittering light of which they are guided. It is on account of the sinfulness of man, which the sun is forced to contemplate on his rounds, that he grows weaker as the time of his going down approaches, for sins have a defiling and enfeebling effect, and he drops from the horizon as a sphere of blood, for blood is the sign of corruption. As the sun sets forth on his course in the morning, his wings touch the leaves on the trees of Paradise, and their vibration is communicated to the angels and the holy Hayyot, to the other plants, and also to the trees and plants on earth, and to all the beings on earth and in heaven. It is the signal for them all to cast their eyes upward. As soon as they see the Ineffable Name, which is engraved in the sun, they raise their voices in songs of praise to God. At the same moment a heavenly voice is heard to say, \"Woe to the sons of men that consider not the honor of God like unto these creatures whose voices now rise aloft in adoration.\" These words, naturally, are not heard by men; as little as they perceive the grating of the sun against the wheel to which all the celestial bodies are attached, although the noise it makes is extraordinarily loud. This friction of the sun and the wheel produces the motes dancing about in the sunbeams. They are the carriers of healing to the sick, the only health-giving creations of the fourth day, on the whole an unfortunate day, especially for children, afflicting them with disease. When God punished the envious moon by diminishing her light and splendor, so that she ceased to be the equal of the sun as she had been originally, she fell, and tiny threads were loosed from her body. These are the stars.",

      "title": "The Fifth Day",
      "content": "On the fifth day of creation God took fire and water, and out of these two elements He made the fishes of the sea. The animals in the water are much more numerous than those on land. For every species on land, excepting only the weasel, there is a corresponding species in the water, and, besides, there are many found only in the water. The ruler over the sea-animals is leviathan. With all the other fishes he was made on the fifth day. Originally he was created male and female like all the other animals. But when it appeared that a pair of these monsters might annihilate the whole earth with their united strength, God killed the female. So enormous is leviathan that to quench his thirst he needs all the water that flows from the Jordan into the sea. His food consists of the fish which go between his jaws of their own accord. When he is hungry, a hot breath blows from his nostrils, and it makes the waters of the great sea seething hot. Formidable though behemot, the other monster, is, he feels insecure until he is certain that leviathan has satisfied his thirst. The only thing that can keep him in check is the stickleback, a little fish which was created for the purpose, and of which he stands in great awe. But leviathan is more than merely large and strong; he is wonderfully made besides. His fins radiate brilliant light, the very sun is obscured by it, and also his eyes shed such splendor that frequently the sea is illuminated suddenly by it. No wonder that this marvellous beast is the plaything of God, in whom He takes His pastime. There is but one thing that makes leviathan repulsive, his foul smell: which is so strong that if it penetrated thither, it would render Paradise itself an impossible abode. The real purpose of leviathan is to be served up as a dainty to the pious in the world to come. The female was put into brine as soon as she was killed, to be preserved against the time when her flesh will be needed. The male is destined to offer a delectable sight to all beholders before he is consumed. When his last hour arrives, God will summon the angels to enter into combat with the monster. But no sooner will leviathan cast his glance at them than they will flee in fear and dismay from the field of battle. They will return to the charge with swords, but in vain, for his scales can turn back steel like straw. They will be equally unsuccessful when they attempt to kill him by throwing darts and slinging stones; such missiles will rebound without leaving the least impression on his body. Disheartened, the angels will give up the combat, and God will command leviathan and behemot to enter into a duel with each other. The issue will be that both will drop dead, behemot slaughtered by a blow of leviathan's fins, and leviathan killed by a lash of behemot's tail. From the skin of leviathan God will construct tents to shelter companies of the pious while they enjoy the dishes made of his flesh. The amount assigned to each of the pious will be in proportion to his deserts, and none will envy or begrudge the other his better share. What is left of leviathan's skin will be stretched out over Jerusalem as a canopy, and the light streaming from it will illumine the whole world, and what is left of his flesh after the pious have appeased their appetite, will be distributed among the rest of men, to carry on traffic therewith. On the same day with the fishes, the birds were created, for these two kinds of animals are closely related to each other. Fish are fashioned out of water, and birds out of marshy ground saturated with water. As leviathan is the king of fishes, so the ziz is appointed to rule over the birds. His name comes from the variety of tastes his flesh has; it tastes like this, zeh, and like that, zeh. The ziz is as monstrous of size as leviathan himself. His ankles rest on the earth, and his head reaches to the very sky. It once happened that travellers on a vessel noticed a bird. As he stood in the water, it merely covered his feet, and his head knocked against the sky. The onlookers thought the water could not have any depth at that point, and they prepared to take a bath there. A heavenly voice warned them: \"Alight not here! Once a carpenter's axe slipped from his hand at this spot, and it took it seven years to touch bottom.\" The bird the travellers saw was none other than the ziz. His wings are so huge that unfurled they darken the sun. They protect the earth against the storms of the south; without their aid the earth would not be able to resist the winds blowing thence. Once an egg of the ziz fell to the ground and broke. The fluid from it flooded sixty cities, and the shock crushed three hundred cedars. Fortunately such accidents do not occur frequently. As a rule the bird lets her eggs slide gently into her nest. This one mishap was due to the fact that the egg was rotten, and the bird cast it away carelessly. The ziz has another name, Renanin, because he is the celestial singer. On account of his relation to the heavenly regions he is also called Sekwi, the seer, and, besides, he is called \"son of the nest,\" because his fledgling birds break away from the shell without being hatched by the mother bird; they spring directly from the nest, as it were. Like leviathan, so ziz is a delicacy to be served to the pious at the end of time, to compensate them for the privations which abstaining from the unclean fowls imposed upon them.",

      "title": "The Sixth Day",
      "content": "As the fish were formed out of water, and the birds out of boggy earth well mixed with water, so the mammals were formed out of solid earth, and as leviathan is the most notable representative of the fish kind, and ziz of the bird kind, so behemot is the most notable representative of the mammal kind. Behemot matches leviathan in strength, and he had to be prevented, like leviathan, from multiplying and increasing, else the world could not have continued to exist; after God had created him male and female, He at once deprived him of the desire to propagate his kind. He is so monstrous that he requires the produce of a thousand mountains for his daily food. All the water that flows through the bed of the Jordan in a year suffices him exactly for one gulp. It therefore was necessary to give him one stream entirely for his own use, a stream flowing forth from Paradise, called Yubal. Behemot, too, is destined to be served to the pious as an appetizing dainty, but before they enjoy his flesh, they will be permitted to view the mortal combat between leviathan and behemot, as a reward for having denied themselves the pleasures of the circus and its gladiatorial contests. Leviathan, ziz, and behemot are not the only monsters; there are many others, and marvellous ones, like the reem, a giant animal, of which only one couple, male and female, is in existence. Had there been more, the world could hardly have maintained itself against them. The act of copulation occurs but once in seventy years between them, for God has so ordered it that the male and female reem are at opposite ends of the earth, the one in the east, the other in the west. The act of copulation results in the death of the male. He is bitten by the female and dies of the bite. The female becomes pregnant and remains in this state for no less than twelve years. At the end of this long period she gives birth to twins, a male and a female. The year preceding her delivery she is not able to move. She would die of hunger, were it not that her own spittle flowing copiously from her mouth waters and fructifies the earth near her, and causes it to bring forth enough for her maintenance. For a whole year the animal can but roll from side to side, until finally her belly bursts, and the twins issue forth. Their appearance is thus the signal for the death of the mother reem. She makes room for the new generation, which in turn is destined to suffer the same fate as the generation that went before. Immediately after birth, the one goes eastward and the other westward, to meet only after the lapse of seventy years, propagate themselves, and perish. A traveller who once saw a reem one day old described its height to be four parasangs, and the length of its head one parasang and a half. Its horns measure one hundred ells, and their height is a great deal more. One of the most remarkable creatures is the \"man of the mountain,\" Adne Sadeh, or, briefly, Adam. His form is exactly that of a human being, but he is fastened to the ground by means of a navel-string, upon which his life depends. The cord once snapped, he dies. This animal keeps himself alive with what is produced by the soil around about him as far as his tether permits him to crawl. No creature may venture to approach within the radius of his cord, for he seizes and demolishes whatever comes in his reach. To kill him, one may not go near to him, the navel-string must be severed from a distance by means of a dart, and then he dies amid groans and moans. Once upon a time a traveller happened in the region where this animal is found. He overheard his host consult his wife as to what to do to honor their guest, and resolve to serve \"our man,\" as he said. Thinking he had fallen among cannibals, the stranger ran as fast as his feet could carry him from his entertainer, who sought vainly to restrain him. Afterward, he found out that there had been no intention of regaling him with human flesh, but only with the flesh of the strange animal called \"man.\" As the \"man of the mountain\" is fixed to the ground by his navel-string, so the barnacle-goose is grown to a tree by its bill. It is hard to say whether it is an animal and must be slaughtered to be fit for food, or whether it is a plant and no ritual ceremony is necessary before eating it. Among the birds the phoenix is the most wonderful. When Eve gave all the animals some of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, the phoenix was the only bird that refused to eat thereof, and he was rewarded with eternal life. When he has lived a thousand years, his body shrinks, and the feathers drop from it, until he is as small as an egg. This is the nucleus of the new bird. The phoenix is also called \"the guardian of the terrestrial sphere.\" He runs with the sun on his circuit, and he spreads out his wings and catches up the fiery rays of the sun. If he were not there to intercept them, neither man nor any other animate being would keep alive. On his right wing the following words are inscribed in huge letters, about four thousand stadia high: \"Neither the earth produces me, nor the heavens, but only the wings of fire.\" His food consists of the manna of heaven and the dew of the earth. His excrement is a worm, whose excrement in turn is the cinnamon used by kings and princes. Enoch, who saw the phoenix birds when he was translated, describes them as flying creatures, wonderful and strange in appearance, with the feet and tails of lions, and the heads of crocodiles; their appearance is of a purple color like the rainbow; their size nine hundred measures. Their wings are like those of angels, each having twelve, and they attend the chariot of the sun and go with him, bringing heat and dew as they are ordered by God. In the morning when the sun starts on his daily course, the phoenixes and the chalkidri sing, and every bird flaps its wings, rejoicing the Giver of light, and they sing a song at the command of the Lord. Among reptiles the salamander and the shamir are the most marvellous. The salamander originates from a fire of myrtle wood which has been kept burning for seven years steadily by means of magic arts. Not bigger than a mouse, it yet is invested with peculiar properties. One who smears himself with its blood is invulnerable, and the web woven by it is a talisman against fire. The people who lived at the deluge boasted that, were a fire flood to come, they would protect themselves with the blood of the salamander. King Hezekiah owes his life to the salamander. His wicked father, King Ahaz, had delivered him to the fires of Moloch, and he would have been burnt, had his mother not painted him with the blood of the salamander, so that the fire could do him no harm. The shamir was made at twilight on the sixth day of creation together with other extraordinary things. It is about as large as a barley corn, and it possesses the remarkable property of cutting the hardest of diamonds. For this reason it was used for the stones in the breastplate worn by the high priest. First the names of the twelve tribes were traced with ink on the stones to be set into the breastplate, then the shamir was passed over the lines, and thus they were graven. The wonderful circumstance was that the friction wore no particles from the stones. The shamir was also used for hewing into shape the stones from which the Temple was built, because the law prohibited iron tools to be used for the work in the Temple. The shamir may not be put in an iron vessel for safe-keeping, nor in any metal vessel, it would burst such a receptacle asunder. It is kept wrapped up in a woollen cloth, and this in turn is placed in a lead basket filled with barley bran. The shamir was guarded in Paradise until Solomon needed it. He sent the eagle thither to fetch the worm. With the destruction of the Temple the shamir vanished. A similar fate overtook the tahash, which had been created only that its skin might be used for the Tabernacle. Once the Tabernacle was completed, the tahash disappeared. It had a horn on its forehead, was gaily colored like the turkey-cock, and belonged to the class of clean animals. Among the fishes there are also wonderful creatures, the sea-goats and the dolphins, not to mention leviathan. A sea-faring man once saw a sea-goat on whose horns the words were inscribed: \"I am a little sea-animal, yet I traversed three hundred parasangs to offer myself as food to the leviathan.\" The dolphins are half man and half fish; they even have sexual intercourse with human beings; therefore they are called also \"sons of the sea,\" for in a sense they represent the human kind in the waters. Though every species in the animal world was created during the last two days of the six of creation, yet many characteristics of certain animals appeared later. Cats and mice, foes now, were friends originally. Their later enmity had a distinct cause. On one occasion the mouse appeared before God and spoke: \"I and the cat are partners, but now we have nothing to eat.\" The Lord answered: \"Thou art intriguing against thy companion, only that thou mayest devour her. As a punishment, she shall devour thee.\" Thereupon the mouse: \"O Lord of the world, wherein have I done wrong?\" God replied: \"O thou unclean reptile, thou shouldst have been warned by the example of the moon, who lost a part of her light, because she spake ill of the sun, and what she lost was given to her opponent. The evil intentions thou didst harbor against thy companion shall be punished in the same way. Instead of thy devouring her, she shall devour thee.\" The mouse: \"O Lord of the world! Shall my whole kind be destroyed?\" God: \"I will take care that a remnant of thee is spared.\" In her rage the mouse bit the cat, and the cat in turn threw herself upon the mouse, and hacked into her with her teeth until she lay dead. Since that moment the mouse stands in such awe of the cat that she does not even attempt to defend herself against her enemy's attacks, and always keeps herself in hiding. Similarly dogs and cats maintained a friendly relation to each other, and only later on became enemies. A dog and a cat were partners, and they shared with each other whatever they had. It once happened that neither could find anything to eat for three days. Thereupon the dog proposed that they dissolve their partnership. The cat should go to Adam, in whose house there would surely be enough for her to eat, while the dog should seek his fortune elsewhere. Before they separated, they took an oath never to go to the same master. The cat took up her abode with Adam, and she found sufficient mice in his house to satisfy her appetite. Seeing how useful she was in driving away and extirpating mice, Adam treated her most kindly. The dog, on the other hand, saw bad times. The first night after their separation he spent in the cave of the wolf, who had granted him a night's lodging. At night the dog caught the sound of steps, and he reported it to his host, who bade him repulse the intruders. They were wild animals. Little lacked and the dog would have lost his life. Dismayed, the dog fled from the house of the wolf, and took refuge with the monkey. But he would not grant him even a single night's lodging; and the fugitive was forced to appeal to the hospitality of the sheep. Again the dog heard steps in the middle of the night. Obeying the bidding of his host, he arose to chase away the marauders, who turned out to be wolves. The barking of the dog apprised the wolves of the presence of sheep, so that the dog innocently caused the sheep's death. Now he had lost his last friend. Night after night he begged for shelter, without ever finding a home. Finally, he decided to repair to the house of Adam, who also granted him refuge for one night. When wild animals approached the house under cover of darkness, the dog began to bark, Adam awoke, and with his bow and arrow he drove them away. Recognizing the dog's usefulness, he bade him remain with him always. But as soon as the cat espied the dog in Adam's house, she began to quarrel with him, and reproach him with having broken his oath to her. Adam did his best to pacify the cat. He told her he had himself invited the dog to make his home there, and he assured her she would in no wise be the loser by the dog's presence; he wanted both to stay with him. But it was impossible to appease the cat. The dog promised her not to touch anything intended for her. She insisted that she could not live in one and the same house with a thief like the dog. Bickerings between the dog and the cat became the order of the day. Finally the dog could stand it no longer, and he left Adam's house, and betook himself to Seth's. By Seth he was welcomed kindly, and from Seth's house, he continued to make efforts at reconciliation with the cat. In vain. Yes, the enmity between the first dog and the first cat was transmitted to all their descendants until this very day. Even the physical peculiarities of certain animals were not original features with them, but owed their existence to something that occurred subsequent to the days of creation. The mouse at first had quite a different mouth from its present mouth. In Noah's ark, in which all animals, to ensure the preservation of every kind, lived together peaceably, the pair of mice were once sitting next to the cat. Suddenly the latter remembered that her father was in the habit of devouring mice, and thinking there was no harm in following his example, she jumped at the mouse, who vainly looked for a hole into which to slip out of sight. Then a miracle happened; a hole appeared where none had been before, and the mouse sought refuge in it. The cat pursued the mouse, and though she could not follow her into the hole, she could insert her paw and try to pull the mouse out of her covert. Quickly the mouse opened her mouth in the hope that the paw would go into it, and the cat would be prevented from fastening her claws in her flesh. But as the cavity of the mouth was not big enough, the cat succeeded in clawing the cheeks of the mouse. Not that this helped her much, it merely widened the mouth of the mouse, and her prey after all escaped the cat. After her happy escape, the mouse betook herself to Noah and said to him, \"O pious man, be good enough to sew up my cheek where my enemy, the cat, has torn a rent in it.\" Noah bade her fetch a hair out of the tail of the swine, and with this he repaired the damage. Thence the little seam-like line next to the mouth of every mouse to this very day. The raven is another animal that changed its appearance during its sojourn in the ark. When Noah desired to send him forth to find out about the state of the waters, he hid under the wings of the eagle. Noah found him, however, and said to him, \"Go and see whether the waters have diminished.\" The raven pleaded: \"Hast thou none other among all the birds to send on this errand?\" Noah: \"My power extends no further than over thee and the dove.\" But the raven was not satisfied. He said to Noah with great insolence: \"Thou sendest me forth only that I may meet my death, and thou wishest my death that my wife may be at thy service.\" Thereupon Noah cursed the raven thus: \"May thy mouth, which has spoken evil against me, be accursed, and thy intercourse with thy wife be only through it.\" All the animals in the ark said Amen. And this is the reason why a mass of spittle runs from the mouth of the male raven into the mouth of the female during the act of copulation, and only thus the female is impregnated. Altogether the raven is an unattractive animal. He is unkind toward his own young so long as their bodies are not covered with black feathers, though as a rule ravens love one another. God therefore takes the young ravens under His special protection. From their own excrement maggots come forth, which serve as their food during the three days that elapse after their birth, until their white feathers turn black and their parents recognize them as their offspring and care for them. The raven has himself to blame also for the awkward hop in his gait. He observed the graceful step of the dove, and envious of her tried to enmulate it. The outcome was that he almost broke his bones without in the least succeeding in making himself resemble the dove, not to mention that he brought the scorn of the other animals down upon himself. His failure excited their ridicule. Then he decided to return to his own original gait, but in the interval he had unlearnt it, and he could walk neither the one way nor the other properly. His step had become a hop betwixt and between. Thus we see how true it is, that he who is dissatisfied with his small portion loses the little he has in striving for more and better things. The steer is also one of the animals that have suffered a change in the course of time. Originally his face was entirely overgrown with hair, but now there is none on his nose, and that is because Joshua kissed him on his nose during the siege of Jericho. Joshua was an exceedingly heavy man. Horses, donkeys, and mules, none could bear him, they all broke down under his weight. What they could not do, the steer accomplished. On his back Joshua rode to the siege of Jericho, and in gratitude he bestowed a kiss upon his nose. The serpent, too, is other than it was at first. Before the fall of man it was the cleverest of all animals created, and in form it resembled man closely. It stood upright, and was of extraordinary size. Afterward, it lost the mental advantages it had possessed as compared with other animals, and it degenerated physically, too; it was deprived of its feet, so that it could not pursue other animals and kill them. The mole and the frog had to be made harmless in similar ways; the former has no eyes, else it were irresistible, and the frog has no teeth, else no animal in the water were sure of its life. While the cunning of the serpent wrought its own undoing, the cunning of the fox stood him in good stead in many an embarrassing situation. After Adam had committed the sin of disobedience, God delivered the whole of the animal world into the power of the Angel of Death, and He ordered him to cast one pair of each kind into the water. He and leviathan together thus have dominion over all that has life. When the Angel of Death was in the act of executing the Divine command upon the fox, he began to weep bitterly. The Angel of Death asked him the reason of his tears, and the fox replied that he was mourning the sad fate of his friend. At the same time he pointed to the figure of a fox in the sea, which was nothing but his own reflection. The Angel of Death, persuaded that a representative of the fox family had been cast into the water, let him go free. The fox told his trick to the cat, and she in turn played it on the Angel of Death. So it happened that neither cats nor foxes are represented in the water, while all other animals are. When leviathan passed the animals in review, and missing the fox was informed of the sly way in which he had eluded his authority, he dispatched great and powerful fish on the errand of enticing the truant into the water. The fox walking along the shore espied the large number of fish, and he exclaimed, \"How happy he who may always satisfy his hunger with the flesh of such as these.\" The fish told him, if he would but follow them, his appetite could easily be appeased. At the same time they informed him that a great honor awaited him. Leviathan, they said, was at death's door, and he had commissioned them to install the fox as his successor. They were ready to carry him on their backs, so that he had no need to fear the water, and thus they would convey him to the throne, which stood upon a huge rock. The fox yielded to these persuasions, and descended into the water. Presently an uncomfortable feeling took possession of him. He began to suspect that the tables were turned; he was being made game of instead of making game of others as usual. He urged the fish to tell him the truth, and they admitted that they had been sent out to secure his person for leviathan, who wanted his heart, that he might become as knowing as the fox, whose wisdom he had heard many extol. The fox said reproachfully: \"Why did you not tell me the truth at once? Then I could have brought my heart along with me for King Leviathan, who would have showered honors upon me. As it is, you will surely suffer punishment for bringing me without my heart. The foxes, you see,\" he continued, \"do not carry their hearts around with them. They keep them in a safe place, and when they have need of them, they fetch them thence.\" The fish quickly swam to shore, and landed the fox, so that he might go for his heart. No sooner did he feel dry land under his feet than he began to jump and shout, and when they urged him to go in search of his heart, and follow them, he said: \"O ye fools, could I have followed you into the water, if I had not had my heart with me? Or exists there a creature able to go abroad without his heart?\" The fish replied: \"Come, come, thou art fooling us.\" Whereupon the fox: \"O ye fools, if I could play a trick on the Angel of Death, how much easier was it to make game of you?\" So they had to return, their errand undone, and leviathan could not but confirm the taunting judgment of the fox: \"In very truth, the fox is wise of heart, and ye are fools.\"",

      "content": "\"Whatever God created has value.\" Even the animals and the insects that seem useless and noxious at first sight have a vocation to fulfil. The snail trailing a moist streak after it as it crawls, and so using up its vitality, serves as a remedy for boils. The sting of a hornet is healed by the house-fly crushed and applied to the wound. The gnat, feeble creature, taking in food but never secreting it, is a specific against the poison of a viper, and this venomous reptile itself cures eruptions, while the lizard is the antidote to the scorpion. Not only do all creatures serve man, and contribute to his comfort, but also God \"teacheth us through the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wise through the fowls of heaven.\" He endowed many animals with admirable moral qualities as a pattern for man. If the Torah had not been revealed to us, we might have learnt regard for the decencies of life from the cat, who covers her excrement with earth; regard for the property of others from the ants, who never encroach upon one another's stores; and regard for decorous conduct from the cock, who, when he desires to unite with the hen, promises to buy her a cloak long enough to reach to the ground, and when the hen reminds him of his promise, he shakes his comb and says, \"May I be deprived of my comb, if I do not buy it when I have the means.\" The grasshopper also has a lesson to teach to man. All the summer through it sings, until its belly bursts, and death claims it. Though it knows the fate that awaits it, yet it sings on. So man should do his duty toward God, no matter what the consequences. The stork should be taken as a model in two respects. He guards the purity of his family life zealously, and toward his fellows he is compassionate and merciful. Even the frog can be the teacher of man. By the side of the water there lives a species of animals which subsist off aquatic creatures alone. When the frog notices that one of them is hungry, he goes to it of his own accord, and offers himself as food, thus fulfilling the injunction, \"If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink.\" The whole of creation was called into existence by God unto His glory, and each creature has its own hymn of praise wherewith to extol the Creator. Heaven and earth, Paradise and hell, desert and field, rivers and seas—all have their own way of paying homage to God. The hymn of the earth is, \"From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, glory to the Righteous.\" The sea exclaims, \"Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea, the Lord on high is mighty.\" Also the celestial bodies and the elements proclaim the praise of their Creator—the sun, moon, and stars, the clouds and the winds, lightning and dew. The sun says, \"The sun and moon stood still in their habitation, at the light of Thine arrows as they went, at the shining of Thy glittering spear\"; and the stars sing, \"Thou art the Lord, even Thou alone; Thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and Thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth Thee.\" Every plant, furthermore, has a song of praise. The fruitful tree sings, \"Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy, before the Lord, for He cometh; for He cometh to judge the earth\"; and the ears of grain on the field sing, \"The pastures are covered with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.\" Great among singers of praise are the birds, and greatest among them is the cock. When God at midnight goes to the pious in Paradise, all the trees therein break out into adoration, and their songs awaken the cock, who begins in turn to praise God. Seven times he crows, each time reciting a verse. The first verse is: \"Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in. Who is the King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.\" The second verse: \"Lift up your heads, O ye gates; yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory.\" The third: \"Arise, ye righteous, and occupy yourselves with the Torah, that your reward may be abundant in the world hereafter.\" The fourth: \"I have waited for Thy salvation, O Lord!\" The fifth: \"How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?\" The sixth: \"Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.\" And the seventh verse sung by the cock runs: \"It is time to work for the Lord, for they have made void Thy law.\" The song of the vulture is: \"I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them, and they shall increase as they have increased\"—the same verse with which the bird will in time to come announce the advent of the Messiah, the only difference being, that when he heralds the Messiah he will sit upon the ground and sing his verse, while at all other times he is seated elsewhere when he sings it. Nor do the other animals praise God less than the birds. Even the beasts of prey give forth adoration. The lion says: \"The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man; He shall stir up jealousy like a man of war; He shall cry, yea, He shall shout aloud; He shall do mightily against his enemies.\" And the fox exhorts unto justice with the words: \"Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by injustice; that useth his neighbor's service without wages, and giveth him not his hire.\" Yea, the dumb fishes know how to proclaim the praise of their Lord. \"The voice of the Lord is upon the waters,\" they say, \"the God of glory thundereth, even the Lord upon many waters\"; while the frog exclaims, \"Blessed be the name of the glory of His kingdom forever and ever.\" Contemptible though they are, even the reptiles give praise unto their Creator. The mouse extols God with the words: \"Howbeit Thou art just in all that is come upon me; for Thou hast dealt truly, but I have done wickedly.\" And the cat sings: \"Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.\"",

      "content": "With ten Sayings God created the world, although a single Saying would have sufficed. God desired to make known how severe is the punishment to be meted out to the wicked, who destroy a world created with as many as ten Sayings, and how goodly the reward destined for the righteous, who preserve a world created with as many as ten Sayings. The world was made for man, though he was the last-comer among its creatures. This was design. He was to find all things ready for him. God was the host who prepared dainty dishes, set the table, and then led His guest to his seat. At the same time man's late appearance on earth is to convey an admonition to humility. Let him beware of being proud, lest he invite the retort that the gnat is older than he. The superiority of man to the other creatures is apparent in the very manner of his creation, altogether different from theirs. He is the only one who was created by the hand of God. The rest sprang from the word of God. The body of man is a microcosm, the whole world in miniature, and the world in turn is a reflex of man. The hair upon his head corresponds to the woods of the earth, his tears to a river, his mouth to the ocean. Also, the world resembles the ball of his eye: the ocean that encircles the earth is like unto the white of the eye, the dry land is the iris, Jerusalem the pupil, and the Temple the image mirrored in the pupil of the eye. But man is more than a mere image of this world. He unites both heavenly and earthly qualities within himself. In four he resembles the angels, in four the beasts. His power of speech, his discriminating intellect, his upright walk, the glance of his eye—they all make an angel of him. But, on the other hand, he eats and drinks, secretes the waste matter in his body, propagates his kind, and dies, like the beast of the field. Therefore God said before the creation of man: \"The celestials are not propagated, but they are immortal; the beings on earth are propagated, but they die. I will create man to be the union of the two, so that when he sins, when he behaves like a beast, death shall overtake him; but if he refrains from sin, he shall live forever.\" God now bade all beings in heaven and on earth contribute to the creation of man, and He Himself took part in it. Thus they all will love man, and if he should sin, they will be interested in his preservation. The whole world naturally was created for the pious, the God-fearing man, whom Israel produces with the helpful guidance of the law of God revealed to him. It was, therefore, Israel who was taken into special consideration at the time man was made. All other creatures were instructed to change their nature, if Israel should ever need their help in the course of his history. The sea was ordered to divide before Moses, and the heavens to give ear to the words of the leader; the sun and the moon were bidden to stand still before Joshua, the ravens to feed Elijah, the fire to spare the three youths in the furnace, the lion to do no harm to Daniel, the fish to spew forth Jonah, and the heavens to open before Ezekiel. In His modesty, God took counsel with the angels, before the creation of the world, regarding His intention of making man. He said: \"For the sake of Israel, I will create the world. As I shall make a division between light and darkness, so I will in time to come do for Israel in Egypt—thick darkness shall be over the land, and the children of Israel shall have light in their dwellings; as I shall make a separation between the waters under the firmament and the waters above the firmament, so I will do for Israel—I will divide the waters for him when he crosses the Red Sea; as on the third day I shall create plants, so I will do for Israel—I will bring forth manna for him in the wilderness; as I shall create luminaries to divide day from night, so I will do for Israel—I will go before him by day in a pillar of cloud and by night in a pillar of fire; as I shall create the fowl of the air and the fishes of the sea, so I will do for Israel—I will bring quails for him from the sea; and as I shall breathe the breath of life into the nostrils of man, so I will do for Israel—I will give the Torah unto him, the tree of life.\" The angels marvelled that so much love should be lavished upon this people of Israel, and God told them: \"On the first day of creation, I shall make the heavens and stretch them out; so will Israel raise up the Tabernacle as the dwelling-place of My glory. On the second day, I shall put a division between the terrestrial waters and the heavenly waters; so will he hang up a veil in the Tabernacle to divide the Holy Place and the Most Holy. On the third day, I shall make the earth put forth grass and herb; so will he, in obedience to My commands, eat herbs on the first night of the Passover, and prepare showbread for Me. On the fourth day, I shall make the luminaries; so will he make a golden candlestick for Me. On the fifth day, I shall create the birds; so will he fashion the cherubim with outstretched wings. On the sixth day, I shall create man; so will Israel set aside a man of the sons of Aaron as high priest for My service.\" Accordingly, the whole of creation was conditional. God said to the things He made on the first six days: \"If Israel accepts the Torah, you will continue and endure; otherwise, I shall turn everything back into chaos again.\" The whole world was thus kept in suspense and dread until the day of the revelation on Sinai, when Israel received and accepted the Torah, and so fulfilled the condition made by God at the time when He created the universe.",

      "content": "God in His wisdom hiving resolved to create man, He asked counsel of all around Him before He proceeded to execute His purpose—an example to man, be he never so great and distinguished, not to scorn the advice of the humble and lowly. First God called upon heaven and earth, then upon all other things He had created, and last upon the angels. The angels were not all of one opinion. The Angel of Love favored the creation of man, because he would be affectionate and loving; but the Angel of Truth opposed it, because he would be full of lies. And while the Angel of Justice favored it, because he would practice justice, the Angel of Peace opposed it, because he would be quarrelsome. To invalidate his protest, God cast the Angel of Truth down from heaven to earth, and when the others cried out against such contemptuous treatment of their companion, He said, \"Truth will spring back out of the earth.\" The objections of the angels would have been much stronger, had they known the whole truth about man. God had told them only about the pious, and had concealed from them that there would be reprobates among mankind, too. And yet, though they knew but half the truth, the angels were nevertheless prompted to cry out: \"What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that Thou visitest him?\" God replied: \"The fowl of the air and the fish of the sea, what were they created for? Of what avail a larder full of appetizing dainties, and no guest to enjoy them?\" And the angels could not but exclaim: \"O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the earth! Do as is pleasing in Thy sight.\" For not a few of the angels their opposition bore fatal consequences. When God summoned the band under the archangel Michael, and asked their opinion on the creation of man, they answered scornfully: \"What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that Thou visitest him?\" God thereupon stretched forth His little finger, and all were consumed by fire except their chief Michael. And the same fate befell the band under the leadership of the archangel Gabriel; he alone of all was saved from destruction. The third band consulted was commanded by the archangel Labbiel. Taught by the horrible fate of his predecessors, he warned his troop: \"You have seen what misfortune overtook the angels who said 'What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?' Let us have a care not to do likewise, lest we suffer the same dire punishment. For God will not refrain from doing in the end what He has planned. Therefore it is advisable for us to yield to His wishes.\" Thus warned, the angels spoke: \"Lord of the world, it is well that Thou hast thought of creating man. Do Thou create him according to Thy will. And as for us, we will be his attendants and his ministers, and reveal unto him all our secrets.\" Thereupon God changed Labbiel's name to Raphael, the Rescuer, because his host of angels had been rescued by his sage advice. He was appointed the Angel of Healing, who has in his safe-keeping all the celestial remedies, the types of the medical remedies used on earth.",

Gabriel remonstrated: \"Why, O Earth, dost thou not hearken unto the voice of the Lord, who founded thee upon the waters without props or pillars?\" The earth replied, and said: \"I am destined to become a curse, and to be cursed through man, and if God Himself does not take the dust from me, no one else shall ever do it.\" When God heard this, He stretched out His hand, took of the dust of the ground, and created the first man therewith. Of set purpose the dust was taken from all four corners of the earth, so that if a man from the east should happen to die in the west, or a man from the west in the east, the earth should not dare refuse to receive the dead, and tell him to go whence he was taken. Wherever a man chances to die, and wheresoever he is buried, there will he return to the earth from which he sprang. Also, the dust was of various colors—red, black, white, and green—red for the blood, black for the bowels, white for the bones and veins, and green for the pale skin. At this early moment the Torah interfered. She addressed herself to God: \"O Lord of the world! The world is Thine, Thou canst do with it as seemeth good in Thine eyes. But the man Thou art now creating will be few of days and full of trouble and sin. If it be not Thy purpose to have forbearance and patience with him, it were better not to call him into being.\" God replied, \"Is it for naught I am called long-suffering and merciful?\" The grace and lovingkindness of God revealed themselves particularly in His taking one spoonful of dust from the spot where in time to come the altar would stand, saying, \"I shall take man from the place of atonement, that he may endure.\"",

      "title": "The Soul Of Man",
      "content": "The care which God exercised in fashioning every detail of the body of man is as naught in comparison with His solicitude for the human soul. The soul of man was created on the first day, for it is the spirit of God moving upon the face of the waters. Thus, instead of being the last, man is really the first work of creation. This spirit, or, to call it by its usual name, the soul of man, possesses five different powers. By means of one of them she escapes from the body every night, rises up to heaven, and fetches new life thence for man. With the soul of Adam the souls of all the generations of men were created. They are stored up in a promptuary, in the seventh of the heavens, whence they are drawn as they are needed for human body after human body. The soul and body of man are united in this way: When a woman has conceived, the Angel of the Night, Lailah, carries the sperm before God, and God decrees what manner of human being shall become of it—whether it shall be male or female, strong or weak, rich or poor, beautiful or ugly, long or short, fat or thin, and what all its other qualities shall be. Piety and wickedness alone are left to the determination of man himself. Then God makes a sign to the angel appointed over the souls, saying, \"Bring Me the soul so-and-so, which is hidden in Paradise, whose name is so-and-so, and whose form is so-and-so.\" The angel brings the designated soul, and she bows down when she appears in the presence of God, and prostrates herself before Him. At that moment, God issues the command, \"Enter this sperm.\" The soul opens her mouth, and pleads: \"O Lord of the world! I am well pleased with the world in which I have been living since the day on which Thou didst call me into being. Why dost Thou now desire to have me enter this impure sperm, I who am holy and pure, and a part of Thy glory?\" God consoles her: \"The world which I shall cause thee to enter is better than the world in which thou hast lived hitherto, and when I created thee, it was only for this purpose.\" The soul is then forced to enter the sperm against her will, and the angel carries her back to the womb of the mother. Two angels are detailed to watch that she shall not leave it, nor drop out of it, and a light is set above her, whereby the soul can see from one end of the world to the other. In the morning an angel carries her to Paradise, and shows her the righteous, who sit there in their glory, with crowns upon their heads. The angel then says to the soul, \"Dost thou know who these are?\" She replies in the negative, and the angel goes on: \"These whom thou beholdest here were formed, like unto thee, in the womb of their mother. When they came into the world, they observed God's Torah and His commandments. Therefore they became the partakers of this bliss which thou seest them enjoy. Know, also thou wilt one day depart from the world below, and if thou wilt observe God's Torah, then wilt thou be found worthy of sitting with these pious ones. But if not, thou wilt be doomed to the other place.\" In the evening, the angel takes the soul to hell, and there points out the sinners whom the Angels of Destruction are smiting with fiery scourges, the sinners all the while crying out Woe! Woe! but no mercy is shown unto them. The angel then questions the soul as before, \"Dost thou know who these are?\" and as before the reply is negative. The angel continues: \"These who are consumed with fire were created like unto thee. When they were put into the world, they did not observe God's Torah and His commandments. Therefore have they come to this disgrace which thou seest them suffer. Know, thy destiny is also to depart from the world. Be just, therefore, and not wicked, that thou mayest gain the future world.\" Between morning and evening the angel carries the soul around, and shows her where she will live and where she will die, and the place where she will buried, and he takes her through the whole world, and points out the just and the sinners and all things. In the evening, he replaces her in the womb of the mother, and there she remains for nine months. When the time arrives for her to emerge from the womb into the open world, the same angel addresses the soul, \"The time has come for thee to go abroad into the open world.\" The soul demurs, \"Why dost thou want to make me go forth into the open world?\" The angel replies: \"Know that as thou wert formed against thy will, so now thou wilt be born against thy will, and against thy will thou shalt die, and against thy will thou shalt give account of thyself before the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He.\" But the soul is reluctant to leave her place. Then the angel fillips the babe on the nose, extinguishes the light at his head, and brings him forth into the world against his will. Immediately the child forgets all his soul has seen and learnt, and he comes into the world crying, for he loses a place of shelter and security and rest. When the time arrives for man to quit this world, the same angel appears and asks him, \"Dost thou recognize me?\" And man replies, \"Yes; but why dost thou come to me to-day, and thou didst come on no other day?\" The angel says, \"To take thee away from the world, for the time of thy departure has arrived.\" Then man falls to weeping, and his voice penetrates to all ends of the world, yet no creature hears his voice, except the cock alone. Man remonstrates with the angel, \"From two worlds thou didst take me, and into this world thou didst bring me.\" But the angel reminds him: \"Did I not tell thee that thou wert formed against thy will, and thou wouldst be born against thy will, and against thy will thou wouldst die? And against thy will thou wilt have to give account and reckoning of thyself before the Holy One, blessed be He.\"",

      "content": "Like all creatures formed on the six days of creation, Adam came from the hands of the Creator fully and completely developed. He was not like a child, but like a man of twenty years of age. The dimensions of his body were gigantic, reaching from heaven to earth, or, what amounts to the same, from east to west. Among later generations of men, there were but few who in a measure resembled Adam in his extraordinary size and physical perfections. Samson possessed his strength, Saul his neck, Absalom his hair, Asahel his fleetness of foot, Uzziah his forehead, Josiah his nostrils, Zedekiah his eyes, and Zerubbabel his voice. History shows that these physical excellencies were no blessings to many of their possessors; they invited the ruin of almost all. Samson's extraordinary strength caused his death; Saul killed himself by cutting his neck with his own sword; while speeding swiftly, Asahel was pierced by Abner's spear; Absalom was caught up by his hair in an oak, and thus suspended met his death; Uzziah was smitten with leprosy upon his forehead; the darts that killed Josiah entered through his nostrils, and Zedekiah's eyes were blinded. The generality of men inherited as little of the beauty as of the portentous size of their first father. The fairest women compared with Sarah are as apes compared with a human being. Sarah's relation to Eve is the same, and, again, Eve was but as an ape compared with Adam. His person was so handsome that the very sole of his foot obscured the splendor of the sun. His spiritual qualities kept pace with his personal charm, for God had fashioned his soul with particular care. She is the image of God, and as God fills the world, so the soul fills the human body; as God sees all things, and is seen by none, so the soul sees, but cannot be seen; as God guides the world, so the soul guides the body; as God in His holiness is pure, so is the soul; and as God dwells in secret, so doth the soul. When God was about to put a soul into Adam's clod-like body, He said: \"At which point shall I breathe the soul into him? Into the mouth? Nay, for he will use it to speak ill of his fellow-man. Into the eyes? With them he will wink lustfully. Into the ears? They will hearken to slander and blasphemy. I will breathe her into his nostrils; as they discern the unclean and reject it, and take in the fragrant, so the pious will shun sin, and will cleave to the words of the Torah\" The perfections of Adam's soul showed themselves as soon as he received her, indeed, while he was still without life. In the hour that intervened between breathing a soul into the first man and his becoming alive, God revealed the whole history of mankind to him. He showed him each generation and its leaders; each generation and its prophets; each generation and its teachers; each generation and its scholars; each generation and its statesmen; each generation and its judges; each generation and its pious members; each generation and its average, commonplace members; and each generation and its impious members. The tale of their years, the number of their days, the reckoning of their hours, and the measure of their steps, all were made known unto him. Of his own free will Adam relinquished seventy of his allotted years. His appointed span was to be a thousand years, one of the Lord's days. But he saw that only a single minute of life was apportioned to the great soul of David, and he made a gift of seventy years to her, reducing his own years to nine hundred and thirty.' The wisdom of Adam displayed itself to greatest advantage when he gave names to the animals. Then it appeared that God, in combating the arguments of the angels that opposed the creation of man, had spoken well, when He insisted that man would possess more wisdom than they themselves. When Adam was barely an hour old, God assembled the whole world of animals before him and the angels. The latter were called upon to name the different kinds, but they were not equal to the task. Adam, however, spoke without hesitation: \"O Lord of the world! The proper name for this animal is ox, for this one horse, for this one lion, for this one camel.\" And so he called all in turn by name, suiting the name to the peculiarity of the animal. Then God asked him what his name was to be, and he said Adam, because he had been created out of Adamah, dust of the earth. Again, God asked him His own name, and he said: \"Adonai, Lord, because Thou art Lord over all creatures\"—the very name God had given unto Himself, the name by which the angels call Him, the name that will remain immutable evermore. But without the gift of the holy spirit, Adam could not have found names for all; he was in very truth a prophet, and his wisdom a prophetic quality. The names of the animals were not the only inheritance handed down by Adam to the generations after him, for mankind owes all crafts to him, especially the art of writing, and he was the inventor of all the seventy languages. And still another task he accomplished for his descendants. God showed Adam the whole earth, and Adam designated what places were to be settled later by men, and what places were to remain waste.",

      "title": "The Fall Of Satan",
      "content": "The extraordinary qualities with which Adam was blessed, physical and spiritual as well, aroused the envy of the angels. They attempted to consume him with fire, and he would have perished, had not the protecting hand of God rested upon him, and established peace between him and the heavenly host. In particular, Satan was jealous of the first man, and his evil thoughts finally led to his fall. After Adam had been endowed with a soul, God invited all the angels to come and pay him reverence and homage. Satan, the greatest of the angels in heaven, with twelve wings, instead of six like all the others, refused to pay heed to the behest of God, saying, \"Thou didst create us angels from the splendor of the Shekinah, and now Thou dost command us to cast ourselves down before the creature which Thou didst fashion out of the dust of the ground!\" God answered, \"Yet this dust of the ground has more wisdom and understanding than thou.\" Satan demanded a trial of wit with Adam, and God assented thereto, saying: \"I have created beasts, birds, and reptiles, I shall have them all come before thee and before Adam. If thou art able to give them names, I shall command Adam to show honor unto thee, and thou shalt rest next to the Shekinah of My glory. But if not, and Adam calls them by the names I have assigned to them, then thou wilt be subject to Adam, and he shall have a place in My garden, and cultivate it.\" Thus spake God, and He betook Himself to Paradise, Satan following Him. When Adam beheld God, he said to his wife, \"O come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.\" Now Satan attempted to assign names to the animals. He failed with the first two that presented themselves, the ox and the cow. God led two others before him, the camel and the donkey, with the same result. Then God turned to Adam, and questioned him regarding the names of the same animals, framing His questions in such wise that the first letter of the first word was the same as the first letter of the name of the animal standing before him. Thus Adam divined the proper name, and Satan was forced to acknowledge the superiority of the first man. Nevertheless he broke out in wild outcries that reached the heavens, and he refused to do homage unto Adam as he had been bidden. The host of angels led by him did likewise, in spite of the urgent representations of Michael, who was the first to prostrate himself before Adam in order to show a good example to the other angels. Michael addressed Satan: \"Give adoration to the image of God! But if thou doest it not, then the Lord God will break out in wrath against thee.\" Satan replied: \"If He breaks out in wrath against me, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God, I will be like the Most High!\" At once God flung Satan and his host out of heaven, down to the earth, and from that moment dates the enmity between Satan and man.' WOMAN When Adam opened his eyes the first time, and beheld the world about him, he broke into praise of God, \"How great are Thy works, O Lord!\" But his admiration for the world surrounding him did not exceed the admiration all creatures conceived for Adam. They took him to be their creator, and they all came to offer him adoration. But he spoke: \"Why do you come to worship me? Nay, you and I together will acknowledge the majesty and the might of Him who hath created us all. 'The Lord reigneth,'\" he continued, \"'He is apparelled with majesty.'\" And not alone the creatures on earth, even the angels thought Adam the lord of all, and they were about to salute him with \"Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts,\" when God caused sleep to fall upon him, and then the angels knew that he was but a human being. The purpose of the sleep that enfolded Adam was to give him a wife, so that the human race might develop, and all creatures recognize the difference between God and man. When the earth heard what God had resolved to do, it began to tremble and quake. \"I have not the strength,\" it said, \"to provide food for the herd of Adam's descendants.\" But God pacified it with the words, \"I and thou together, we will find food for the herd.\" Accordingly, time was divided between God and the earth; God took the night, and the earth took the day. Refreshing sleep nourishes and strengthens man, it affords him life and rest, while the earth brings forth produce with the help of God, who waters it. Yet man must work the earth to earn his food. The Divine resolution to bestow a companion on Adam met the wishes of man, who had been overcome by a feeling of isolation when the animals came to him in pairs to be named. To banish his loneliness, Lilith was first given to Adam as wife. Like him she had been created out of the dust of the ground. But she remained with him only a short time, because she insisted upon enjoying full equality with her husband. She derived her rights from their identical origin. With the help of the Ineffable Name, which she pronounced, Lilith flew away from Adam, and vanished in the air. Adam complained before God that the wife He had given him had deserted him, and God sent forth three angels to capture her. They found her in the Red Sea, and they sought to make her go back with the threat that, unless she went, she would lose a hundred of her demon children daily by death. But Lilith preferred this punishment to living with Adam. She takes her revenge by injuring babes—baby boys during the first night of their life, while baby girls are exposed to her wicked designs until they are twenty days old. The only way to ward off the evil is to attach an amulet bearing the names of her three angel captors to the children, for such had been the agreement between them. The woman destined to become the true companion of man was taken from Adam's body, for \"only when like is joined unto like the union is indissoluble.\" The creation of woman from man was possible because Adam originally had two faces, which were separated at the birth of Eve. When God was on the point of making Eve, He said: \"I will not make her from the head of man, lest she carry her head high in arrogant pride; not from the eye, lest she be wanton-eyed; not from the ear, lest she be an eavesdropper; not from the neck, lest she be insolent; not from the mouth, lest she be a tattler; not from the heart, lest she be inclined to envy; not from the hand, lest she be a meddler; not from the foot, lest she be a gadabout. I will form her from a chaste portion of the body,\" and to every limb and organ as He formed it, God said, \"Be chaste! Be chaste!\" Nevertheless, in spite of the great caution used, woman has all the faults God tried to obviate. The daughters of Zion were haughty and walked with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes; Sarah was an eavesdropper in her own tent, when the angel spoke with Abraham; Miriam was a talebearer, accusing Moses; Rachel was envious of her sister Leah; Eve put out her hand to take the forbidden fruit, and Dinah was a gadabout. The physical formation of woman is far more complicated than that of man, as it must be for the function of child-bearing, and likewise the intelligence of woman matures more quickly than the intelligence of man. Many of the physical and psychical differences between the two sexes must be attributed to the fact that man was formed from the ground and woman from bone. Women need perfumes, while men do not; dust of the ground remains the same no matter how long it is kept; flesh, however, requires salt to keep it in good condition. The voice of women is shrill, not so the voice of men; when soft viands are cooked, no sound is heard, but let a bone be put in a pot, and at once it crackles. A man is easily placated, not so a woman; a few drops of water suffice to soften a clod of earth; a bone stays hard, and if it were to soak in water for days. The man must ask the woman to be his wife, and not the woman the man to be her husband, because it is man who has sustained the loss of his rib, and he sallies forth to make good his loss again. The very differences between the sexes in garb and social forms go back to the origin of man and woman for their reasons. Woman covers her hair in token of Eve's having brought sin into the world; she tries to hide her shame; and women precede men in a funeral cortege, because it was woman who brought death into the world. And the religious commands addressed to women alone are connected with the history of Eve. Adam was the heave offering of the world, and Eve defiled it. As expiation, all women are commanded to separate a heave offering from the dough. And because woman extinguished the light of man's soul, she is bidden to kindle the Sabbath light. Adam was first made to fall into a deep sleep before the rib for Eve was taken from his side. For, had he watched her creation, she would not have awakened love in him. To this day it is true that men do not appreciate the charms of women whom they have known and observed from childhood up. Indeed, God had created a wife for Adam before Eve, but he would not have her, because she had been made in his presence. Knowing well all the details of her formation, he was repelled by her. But when he roused himself from his profound sleep, and saw Eve before him in all her surprising beauty and grace, he exclaimed, \"This is she who caused my heart to throb many a night!\" Yet he discerned at once what the nature of woman was. She would, he knew, seek to carry her point with man either by entreaties and tears, or flattery and caresses. He said, therefore, \"This is my never-silent bell!\" The wedding of the first couple was celebrated with pomp never repeated in the whole course of history since. God Himself, before presenting her to Adam, attired and adorned Eve as a bride. Yea, He appealed to the angels, saying: \"Come, let us perform services of friendship for Adam and his helpmate, for the world rests upon friendly services, and they are more pleasing in My sight than the sacrifices Israel will offer upon the altar.\" The angels accordingly surrounded the marriage canopy, and God pronounced the blessings upon the bridal couple, as the Hazan does under the Huppah. The angels then danced and played upon musical instruments before Adam and Eve in their ten bridal chambers of gold, pearls, and precious stones, which God had prepared for them. Adam called his wife Ishah, and himself he called Ish, abandoning the name Adam, which he had borne before the creation of Eve, for the reason that God added His own name Yah to the names of the man and the woman—Yod to Ish and He to Ishah—to indicate that as long as they walked in the ways of God and observed His commandments, His name would shield them against all harm. But if they went astray, His name would be withdrawn, and instead of Ish there would remain Esh, fire, a fire issuing from each and consuming the other.",

      "content": "The Garden of Eden was the abode of the first man and woman, and the souls of all men must pass through it after death, before they reach their final destination. For the souls of the departed must go through seven portals before they arrive in the heaven 'Arabot. There the souls of the pious are transformed into angels, and there they remain forever, praising God and feasting their sight upon the glory of the Shekinah. The first portal is the Cave of Machpelah, in the vicinity of Paradise, which is under the care and supervision of Adam. If the soul that presents herself at the portal is worthy, he calls out, \"Make room! Thou art welcome!\" The soul then proceeds until she arrives at the gate of Paradise guarded by the cherubim and the flaming sword. If she is not found worthy, she is consumed by the sword; otherwise she receives a pass-bill, which admits her to the terrestrial Paradise. Therein is a pillar of smoke and light extending from Paradise to the gate of heaven, and it depends upon the character of the soul whether she can climb upward on it and reach heaven. The third portal, Zebul, is at the entrance of heaven. If the soul is worthy, the guard opens the portal and admits her 'to the heavenly Temple. Michael presents her to God, and conducts her to the seventh portal, 'Arabot, within which the souls of the pious, changed to angels, praise the Lord, and feed on the glory of the Shekinah. In Paradise stand the tree of life and the tree of knowledge, the latter forming a hedge about the former. Only he who has cleared a path for himself through the tree of knowledge can come close to the tree of life, which is so huge that it would take a man five hundred years to traverse a distance equal to the diameter of the trunk, and no less vast is the space shaded by its crown of branches. From beneath it flows forth the water that irrigates the whole earth, parting thence into four streams, the Ganges, the Nile, the Tigris, and the Euphrates. But it was only during the days of creation that the realm of plants looked to the waters of the earth for nourishment. Later on God made the plants dependent upon the rain, the upper waters. The clouds rise from earth to heaven, where water is poured into them as from a conduit. The plants began to feel the effect of the water only after Adam was created. Although they had been brought forth on the third day, God did not permit them to sprout and appear above the surface of the earth, until Adam prayed to Him to give food unto them, for God longs for the prayers of the pious. Paradise being such as it was, it was, naturally, not necessary for Adam to work the land. True, the Lord God put the man into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it, but that only means he is to study the Torah there and fulfil the commandments of God. There were especially six commandments which every human being is expected to heed: man should not worship idols; nor blaspheme God; nor commit murder, nor incest, nor theft and robbery; and all generations have the duty of instituting measures of law and order. One more such command there was, but it was a temporary injunction. Adam was to eat only the green things of the field. But the prohibition against the use of animals for food was revoked in Noah's time, after the deluge. Nevertheless, Adam was not cut off from the enjoyment of meat dishes. Though he was not permitted to slaughter animals for the appeasing of his appetite, the angels brought him meat and wine, serving him like attendants. And as the angels ministered to his wants, so also the animals. They were wholly under his dominion, and their food they took out of his hand and out of Eve's. In all respects, the animal world had a different relation to Adam from their relation to his descendants. Not only did they know the language of man, but they respected the image of God, and they feared the first human couple, all of which changed into the opposite after the fall of man.",

      "content": "Among the animals the serpent was notable. Of all of them he had the most excellent qualities, in some of which he resembled man. Like man he stood upright upon two feet, and in height he was equal to the camel. Had it not been for the fall of man, which brought misfortune to them, too, one pair of serpents would have sufficed to perform all the work man has to do, and, besides, they would have supplied him with silver, gold, gems, and pearls. As a matter of fact, it was the very ability of the serpent that led to the ruin of man and his own ruin. His superior mental gifts caused him to become an infidel. It likewise explains his envy of man, especially of his conjugal relations. Envy made him meditate ways and means of bringing about the death of Adam. He was too well acquainted with the character of the man to attempt to exercise tricks of persuasion upon him, and he approached the woman, knowing that women are beguiled easily. The conversation with Eve was cunningly planned, she could not but be caught in a trap. The serpent began, \"Is it true that God hath said, Ye shall not eat of every tree in the garden?\" \"We may,\" rejoined Eve, \"eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden, except that which is in the midst of the garden, and that we may not even touch, lest we be stricken with death.\" She spoke thus, because in his zeal to guard her against the transgressing of the Divine command, Adam had forbidden Eve to touch the tree, though God had mentioned only the eating of the fruit. It remains a truth, what the proverb says, \"Better a wall ten hands high that stands, than a wall a hundred ells high that cannot stand.\" It was Adam's exaggeration that afforded the serpent the possibility of persuading Eve to taste of the forbidden fruit. The serpent pushed Eve against the tree, and said: \"Thou seest that touching the tree has not caused thy death. As little will it hurt thee to eat the fruit of the tree. Naught but malevolence has prompted the prohibition, for as soon as ye eat thereof, ye shall be as God. As He creates and destroys worlds, so will ye have the power to create and destroy. As He doth slay and revive, so will ye have the power to slay and revive. He Himself ate first of the fruit of the tree, and then He created the world. Therefore doth He forbid you to eat thereof, lest you create other worlds. Everyone knows that 'artisans of the same guild hate one another.' Furthermore, have ye not observed that every creature hath dominion over the creature fashioned before itself? The heavens were made on the first day, and they are kept in place by the firmament made on the second day. The firmament, in turn, is ruled by the plants, the creation of the third day, for they take up all the water of the firmament. The sun and the other celestial bodies, which were created on the fourth day, have power over the world of plants. They can ripen their fruits and flourish only through their influence. The creation of the fifth day, the animal world, rules over the celestial spheres. Witness the ziz, which can darken the sun with its pinions. But ye are masters of the whole of creation, because ye were the last to be created. Hasten now and eat of the fruit of the tree in the midst of the garden, and become independent of God, lest He bring forth still other creatures to bear rule over you.\" To give due weight to these words, the serpent began to shake the tree violently and bring down its fruit. He ate thereof, saying: \"As I do not die of eating the fruit, so wilt thou not die.\" Now Eve could not but say to herself, \"All that my master\"—so she called Adam—\"commanded me is but lies,\" and she determined to follow the advice of the serpent. Yet she could not bring herself to disobey the command of God utterly. She made a compromise with her conscience. First she ate only the outside skin of the fruit, and then, seeing that death did not fell her, she ate the fruit itself. Scarce had she finished, when she saw the Angel of Death before her. Expecting her end to come immediately, she resolved to make Adam eat of the forbidden fruit, too, lest he espouse another wife after her death. It required tears and lamentations on her part to prevail upon Adam to take the baleful step. Not yet satisfied, she gave of the fruit to all other living beings, that they, too, might be subject to death. All ate, and they all are mortal, with the exception of the bird malham, who refused the fruit, with the words: \"Is it not enough that ye have sinned against God, and have brought death to others? Must ye still come to me and seek to persuade me into disobeying God's command, that I may eat and die thereof? I will not do your bidding.\" A heavenly voice was heard then to say to Adam and Eve: \"To you was the command given. Ye did not heed it; ye did transgress it, and ye did seek to persuade the bird malham. He was steadfast, and he feared Me, although I gave him no command. Therefore he shall never taste of death, neither he nor his descendants—they all shall live forever in Paradise.\" Adam spoke to Eve: \"Didst thou give me of the tree of which I forbade thee to eat? Thou didst give me thereof, for my eyes are opened, and the teeth in my mouth are set on edge.\" Eve made answer, \"As my teeth were set on edge, so may the teeth of all living beings be set on edge.\" The first result was that Adam and Eve became naked. Before, their bodies had been overlaid with a horny skin, and enveloped with the cloud of glory. No sooner had they violated the command given them than the cloud of glory and the horny skin dropped from them, and they stood there in their nakedness, and ashamed. Adam tried to gather leaves from the trees to cover part of their bodies, but he heard one tree after the other say: \"There is the thief that deceived his Creator. Nay, the foot of pride shall not come against me, nor the hand of the wicked touch me. Hence, and take no leaves from me!\" Only the fig-tree granted him permission to take of its leaves. That was because the fig was the forbidden fruit itself. Adam had the same experience as that prince who seduced one of the maid-ser vants in the palace. When the king, his father, chased him out, he vainly sought a refuge with the other maid-servants, but only she who had caused his disgrace would grant him assistance.",

      "content": "As long as Adam stood naked, casting about for means of escape from his embarrassment, God did not appear unto him, for one should not \"strive to see a man in the hour of his disgrace.\" He waited until Adam and Eve had covered themselves with fig leaves. But even before God spoke to him, Adam knew what was impending. He heard the angels announce, \"God betaketh Himself unto those that dwell in Paradise.\" He heard more, too. He heard what the angels were saying to one another about his fall, and what they were saying to God. In astonishment the angels exclaimed: \"What! He still walks about in Paradise? He is not yet dead?\" Whereupon God: \"I said to him, 'In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die!' Now, ye know not what manner of day I meant—one of My days of a thousand years, or one of your days. I will give him one of My days. He shall have nine hundred and thirty years to live, and seventy to leave to his descendants.\" When Adam and Eve heard God approaching, they hid among the trees—which would not have been possible before the fall. Before he committed his trespass, Adam's height was from the heavens to the earth, but afterward it was reduced to one hundred ells. Another consequence of his sin was the fear Adam felt when he heard the voice of God: before his fall it had not disquieted him in the least. Hence it was that when Adam said, \"I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid,\" God replied, \"Aforetime thou wert not afraid, and now thou art afraid?\" God refrained from reproaches at first. Standing at the gate of Paradise, He but asked, \"Where art thou, Adam?\" Thus did God desire to teach man a rule of polite behavior, never to enter the house of another without announcing himself. It cannot be denied, the words \"Where art thou?\" were pregnant with meaning. They were intended to bring home to Adam the vast difference between his latter and his former state—between his supernatural size then and his shrunken size now; between the lordship of God over him then and the lordship of the serpent over him now. At the same time, God wanted to give Adam the opportunity of repenting of his sin, and he would have received Divine forgiveness for it. But so far from repenting of it, Adam slandered God, and uttered blasphemies against Him. When God asked him, \"Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee thou shouldst not eat?\" he did not confess his sin, but excused himself with the words: \"O Lord of the world! As long as I was alone, I did not fall into sin, but as soon as this woman came to me, she tempted me.\" God replied: \"I gave her unto thee as a help, and thou art ungrateful when thou accusest her, saying, 'She gave me of the tree.' Thou shouldst not have obeyed her, for thou art the head, and not she.\" God, who knows all things, had foreseen exactly this, and He had not created Eve until Adam had asked Him for a helpmate, so that he might not have apparently good reason for reproaching God with having created woman. As Adam tried to shift the blame for his misdeed from himself, so also Eve. She, like her husband, did not confess her transgression and pray for pardon, which would have been granted to her. Gracious as God is, He did not pronounce the doom upon Adam and Eve until they showed themselves stiff-necked. Not so with the serpent. God inflicted the curse upon the serpent without hearing his defense; for the serpent is a villain, and the wicked are good debaters. If God had questioned him, the serpent would have answered: \"Thou didst give them a command, and I did contradict it. Why did they obey me, and not Thee?\" Therefore God did not enter into an argument with the serpent, but straightway decreed the following ten punishments: The mouth of the serpent was closed, and his power of speech taken away; his hands and feet were hacked off; the earth was given him as food; he must suffer great pain in sloughing his skin; enmity is to exist between him and man; if he eats the choicest viands, or drinks the sweetest beverages, they all change into dust in his mouth; the pregnancy of the female serpent lasts seven years; men shall seek to kill him as soon as they catch sight of him; even in the future world, where all beings will be blessed, he will not escape the punishment decreed for him; he will vanish from out of the Holy Land if Israel walks in the ways of God. Furthermore, God spake to the serpent: \"I created thee to be king over all animals, cattle and the beasts of the field alike; but thou wast not satisfied. Therefore thou shalt be cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field. I created thee of upright posture; but thou wast not satisfied. Therefore thou shalt go upon thy belly. I created thee to eat the same food as man; but thou wast not satisfied. Therefore thou shalt eat dust all the days of thy life. Thou didst seek to cause the death of Adam in order to espouse his wife. Therefore I will put enmity between thee and the woman.\" How true it is—he who lusts after what is not his due, not only does he not attain his desire, but he also loses what he has! As angels had been present when the doom was pronounced upon the serpent—for God had convoked a Sanhedrin of seventy-one angels when He sat in judgment upon him—so the execution of the decree against him was entrusted to angels. They descended from heaven, and chopped off his hands and feet. His suffering was so great that his agonized cries could be heard from one end of the world to the other. The verdict against Eve also consisted of ten curses, the effect of which is noticeable to this day in the physical, spiritual, and social state of woman. It was not God Himself who announced her fate to Eve. The only woman with whom God ever spoke was Sarah. In the case of Eve, He made use of the services of an interpreter. Finally, also the punishment of Adam was tenfold: he lost his celestial clothing—God stripped it off him; in sorrow he was to earn his daily bread; the food he ate was to be turned from good into bad; his children were to wander from land to land; his body was to exude sweat; he was to have an evil inclination; in death his body was to be a prey of the worms; animals were to have power over him, in that they could slay him; his days were to be few and full of trouble; in the end he was to render account of all his doings on earth. These three sinners were not the only ones to have punishment dealt out to them. The earth fared no better, for it had been guilty of various misdemeanors. In the first place, it had not entirely heeded the command of God given on the third day, to bring forth \"tree of fruit.\" What God had desired was a tree the wood of which was to be as pleasant to the taste as the fruit thereof. The earth, however, produced a tree bearing fruit, the tree itself not being edible. Again, the earth did not do its whole duty in connection with the sin of Adam. God had appointed the sun and the earth witnesses to testify against Adam in case he committed a trespass. The sun, accordingly, had grown dark the instant Adam became guilty of disobedience, but the earth, not knowing how to take notice of Adam's fall, disregarded it altogether. The earth also had to suffer a tenfold punishment: independent before, she was hereafter to wait to be watered by the rain from above; sometimes the fruits of the earth fail; the grain she brings forth is stricken with blasting and mildew; she must produce all sorts of noxious vermin; thenceforth she was to be divided into valleys and mountains; she must grow barren trees, bearing no fruit; thorns and thistles sprout from her; much is sown in the earth, but little is harvested; in time to come the earth will have to disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain; and, finally, she shall, one day, \"wax old like a garment.\" When Adam heard the words, \"Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth,\" concerning the ground, a sweat broke out on his face, and he said: \"What! Shall I and my cattle eat from the same manger?\" The Lord had mercy upon him, and spoke, \"In view of the sweat of thy face, thou shalt eat bread.\" The earth is not the only thing created that was made to suffer through the sin of Adam. The same fate overtook the moon. When the serpent seduced Adam and Eve, and exposed their nakedness, they wept bitterly, and with them wept the heavens, and the sun and the stars, and all created beings and things up to the throne of God. The very angels and the celestial beings were grieved by the trans gression of Adam. The moon alone laughed, wherefore God grew wroth, and obscured her light. Instead of shining steadily like the sun, all the length of the day, she grows old quickly, and must be born and reborn, again and again. The callous conduct of the moon offended God, not only by way of contrast with the compassion of all other creatures, but because He Himself was full of pity for Adam and his wife. He made clothes for them out of the skin stripped from the serpent. He would have done even more. He would have permitted them to remain in Paradise, if only they had been penitent. But they refused to repent, and they had to leave, lest their godlike understanding urge them to ravage the tree of life, and they learn to live forever. As it was, when God dismissed them from Paradise, He did not allow the Divine quality of justice to prevail entirely. He associated mercy with it. As they left, He said: \"O what a pity that Adam was not able to observe the command laid upon him for even a brief span of time!\" To guard the entrance to Paradise, God appointed the cherubim, called also the ever-turning sword of flames, because angels can turn themselves from one shape into another at need. Instead of the tree of life, God gave Adam the Torah, which likewise is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and he was permitted to take up his abode in the vicinity of Paradise in the east. Sentence pronounced upon Adam and Eve and the serpent, the Lord commanded the angels to turn the man and the woman out of Paradise. They began to weep and supplicate bitterly, and the angels took pity upon them and left the Divine command unfulfilled, until they could petition God to mitigate His severe verdict. But the Lord was inexorable, saying, \"Was it I that committed a trespass, or did I pronounce a false judgment?\" Also Adam's prayer, to be given of the fruit of the tree of life, was turned aside, with the promise, however, that if he would lead a pious life, he would be given of the fruit on the day of resurrection, and he would then live forever. Seeing that God had resolved unalterably, Adam began to weep again and implore the angels to grant him at least permission to take sweet-scented spices with him out of Paradise, that outside, too, he might be able to bring offerings unto God, and his prayers be accepted before the Lord. Thereupon the angels came before God, and spake: \"King unto everlasting, command Thou us to give Adam sweet-scented spices of Paradise,\" and God heard their prayer. Thus Adam gathered saffron, nard, calamus, and cinnamon, and all sorts of seeds besides for his sustenance. Laden with these, Adam and Eve left Paradise, and came upon earth. They had enjoyed the splendors of Paradise but a brief span of time—but a few hours. It was in the first hour of the sixth day of creation that God conceived the idea of creating man; in the second hour, He took counsel with the angels; in the third, He gathered the dust for the body of man; in the fourth, He formed Adam; in the fifth, He clothed him with skin; in the sixth, the soulless shape was complete, so that it could stand upright; in the seventh, a soul was breathed into it; in the eighth, man was led into Paradise; in the ninth, the Divine command prohibiting the fruit of the tree in the midst of the garden was issued to him; in the tenth, he transgressed the command; in the eleventh, he was judged; and in the twelfth hour of the day, he was cast out of Paradise, in atonement for his sin. This eventful day was the first of the month of Tishri. Therefore God spoke to Adam: \"Thou shalt be the prototype of thy children. As thou hast been judged by Me on this day and absolved, so thy children Israel shall be judged by Me on this New Year's Day, and they shall be absolved.\" Each day of creation brought forth three things: the first, heaven, earth, and light; the second, the firmament, Gehenna, and the angels; the third, trees, herbs, and Paradise; the fourth, sun, moon, and stars; and the fifth, fishes, birds, and leviathan. As God intended to rest on the seventh day, the Sabbath, the sixth day had to do double duty. It brought forth six creations: Adam, Eve, cattle, reptiles, the beasts of the field, and demons. The demons were made shortly before the Sabbath came in, and they are, therefore, incorporeal spirits—the Lord had no time to create bodies for them. In the twilight, between the sixth day and the Sabbath, ten creations were, brought forth: the rainbow, invisible until Noah's time; the manna; watersprings, whence Israel drew water for his thirst in the desert; the writing upon the two tables of stone given at Sinai; the pen with which the writing was written; the two tables themselves; the mouth of Balaam's she-ass; the grave of Moses; the cave in which Moses and Elijah dwelt; and the rod of Aaron, with its blossoms and its ripe almonds.",

      "content": "Before the world was created, there was none to praise God and know Him. Therefore He created the angels and the holy Hayyot, the heavens and their host, and Adam as well. They all were to praise and glorify their Creator. During the week of creation, however, there was no suitable time to proclaim the splendor and praise of the Lord. Only on the Sabbath, when all creation rested, the beings on earth and in heaven, all together, broke into song and adoration when God ascended His throne and sate upon it. It was the Throne of Joy upon which He sate, and He had all the angels pass before Him—the angel of the water, the angel of the rivers, the angel of the mountains, the angel of the hills, the angel of the abysses, the angel of the deserts, the angel of the sun, the angel of the moon, the angel of the Pleiades, the angel of Orion, the angel of the herbs, the angel of Paradise, the angel of Gehenna, the angel of the trees, the angel of the reptiles, the angel of the wild beasts, the angel of the domestic animals, the angel of the fishes, the angel of the locusts, the angel of the birds, the chief angel of the angels, the angel of each heaven, the chief angel of each division of the heavenly hosts, the chief angel of the holy Hayyot, the chief angel of the cherubim, the chief angel of the ofanim, and all the other splendid, terrible, and mighty angel chiefs. They all appeared before God with great joy, laved in a stream of joy, and they rejoiced and danced and sang, and extolled the Lord with many praises and many instruments. The ministering angels began, \"Let the glory of the Lord endure forever!\" And the rest of the angels took up the song with the words, \"Let the Lord rejoice in His works!\" 'Arabot, the seventh heaven, was filled with joy and glory, splendor and strength, power and might and pride and magnificence and grandeur, praise and jubilation, song and gladness, steadfastness and righteousness, honor and adoration. Then God bade the Angel of the Sabbath seat himself upon a throne of glory, and He brought before him the chiefs of the angels of all the heavens and all the abysses, and bade them dance and rejoice, saying, \"Sabbath it is unto the Lord!\" and the exalted princes of the heavens responded, \"Unto the Lord it is Sabbath!\" Even Adam was permitted to ascend to the highest heaven, to take part in the rejoicing over the Sabbath. By bestowing Sabbath joy upon all beings, not excepting Adam, thus did the Lord dedicate His creation. Seeing the majesty of the Sabbath, its honor and greatness, and the joy it conferred upon all, being the fount of all joy, Adam intoned a song of praise for the Sabbath day. Then God said to him, \"Thou singest a song of praise to the Sabbath day, and singest none to Me, the God of the Sabbath?\" Thereupon the Sabbath rose from his seat, and prostrated himself before God, saying, \"It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord,\" and the whole of creation added, \"And to sing praises unto Thy Name, O Most High!\" This was the first Sabbath, and this its celebration in heaven by God and the angels. The angels were informed at the same time that in days to come Israel would hallow the day in similar manner. God told them: \"I will set aside for Myself a people from among all the peoples. This people will observe the Sabbath, and I will sanctify it to be My people, and I will be God unto it. From all that I have seen, I have chosen the seed of Israel wholly, and I have inscribed him as My first-born son, and I sanctified him unto Myself unto all eternity, him and the Sabbath, that he keep the Sabbath and hallow it from all work.\" For Adam the Sabbath had a peculiar significance. When he was made to depart out of Paradise in the twilight of the Sabbath eve, the angels called after him, \"Adam did not abide in his glory overnight!\" Then the Sabbath appeared before God as Adam's defender, and he spoke: \"O Lord of the world! During the six working days no creature was slain. If Thou wilt begin now by slaying Adam, what will become of the sanctity and the blessing of the Sabbath?\" In this way Adam was rescued from the fires of hell, the meet punishment for his sins, and in gratitude he composed a psalm in honor of the Sabbath, which David later embodied in his Psalter. Still another opportunity was given to Adam to learn and appreciate the value of the Sabbath. The celestial light, whereby Adam could survey the world from end to end, should properly have been made to disappear immediately after his sin. But out of consideration for the Sabbath, God had let this light continue to shine, and the angels, at sundown on the sixth day, intoned a song of praise and thanksgiving to God, for the radiant light shining through the night. Only with the going out of the Sabbath day the celestial light ceased, to the consternation of Adam, who feared that the serpent would attack him in the dark. But God illumined his understanding, and he learned to rub two stones against each other and produce light for his needs. The celestial light was but one of the seven precious gifts enjoyed by Adam before the fall and to be granted to man again only in the Messianic time. The others are the resplendence of his countenance; life eternal; his tall stature; the fruits of the soil; the fruits of the tree; and the luminaries of the sky, the sun and the moon, for in the world to come the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold.",

      "content": "Cast out of Paradise, Adam and Eve built a hut for themselves, and for seven days they sat in it in great distress, mourning and lamenting. At the end of the seven days, tormented by hunger, they came forth and sought food. For seven other days, Adam journeyed up and down in the land, looking for such dainties as he had enjoyed in Paradise. In vain; he found nothing. Then Eve spoke to her husband: \"My lord, if it please thee, slay me. Mayhap God will then take thee back into Paradise, for the Lord God became wroth with thee only on account of me.\" But Adam rejected her plan with abhorrence, and both went forth again on the search for food. Nine days passed, and still they found naught resembling what they had had in Paradise. They saw only food fit for cattle and beasts. Then Adam proposed: \"Let us do penance, mayhap the Lord God will forgive us and have pity on us, and give us something to sustain our life.\" Knowing that Eve was not vigorous enough to undergo the mortification of the flesh which he purposed to inflict upon himself, he prescribed a penance for her different from his own. He said to her: \"Arise, and go to the Tigris, take a stone and stand upon it in the deepest part of the river, where the water will reach as high as thy neck. And let no speech issue forth from thy mouth, for we are unworthy to supplicate God, our lips are unclean by reason of the forbidden fruit of the tree. Remain in the water for thirty-seven days.\" For himself Adam ordained forty days of fasting, while he stood in the river Jordan in the same way as Eve was to take up her stand in the waters of the Tigris. After he had adjusted the stone in the middle of the Jordan, and mounted it, with the waters surging up to his neck, he said: \"I adjure thee, O thou water of the Jordan! Afflict thyself with me, and gather unto me all swimming creatures that live in thee. Let them surround me and sorrow with me, and let them not beat their own breasts with grief, but let them beat me. Not they have sinned, only I alone!\" Very soon they all came, the dwellers in the Jordan, and they encompassed him, and from that moment the water of the Jordan stood still and ceased from flowing. The penance which Adam and Eve laid upon themselves awakened misgivings in Satan. He feared God might forgive their sin, and therefore essayed to hinder Eve in her purpose. After a lapse of eighteen days he appeared unto her in the guise of an angel. As though in distress on account of her, he began to cry, saying: \"Step up out of the river, and weep no longer. The Lord God hath heard your mourning, and your penitence hath been accepted by Him. All the angels supplicated the Lord in your behalf, and He hath sent me to fetch you out of the water and give you the sustenance that you enjoyed in Paradise, and for which you have been mourning.\" Enfeebled as she was by her penances and mortifications, Eve yielded to the solicitations of Satan, and he led her to where her husband was. Adam recognized him at once, and amid tears he cried out: \"O Eve, Eve, where now is thy penitence? How couldst thou let our adversary seduce thee again—him who robbed us of our sojourn in Paradise and all spiritual joy?\" Thereupon Eve, too, began to weep and cry out: \"Woe unto thee, O Satan! Why strivest thou against us without any reason? What have we done unto thee that thou shouldst pursue us so craftily?\" With a deep-fetched sigh, Satan told them how that Adam, of whom he had been jealous, had been the real reason of his fall. Having lost his glory through him, he had intrigued to have him driven from Paradise. When Adam heard the confession of Satan, he prayed to God: \"O Lord my God! In Thy hands is my life. Remove from me this adversary, who seeks to deliver my soul to destruction, and grant me the glory he has forfeited.\" Satan disappeared forthwith, but Adam continued his penance, standing in the waters of the Jordan for forty days. While Adam stood in the river, he noticed that the days were growing shorter, and he feared the world might be darkened on account of his sin, and go under soon. To avert the doom, he spent eight days in prayer and fasting. But after the winter solstice, when he saw that the days grew longer again, he spent eight days in rejoicing, and in the following year he celebrated both periods, the one before and the one after the solstice. This is why the heathen celebrate the calends and the saturnalia in honor of their gods, though Adam had consecrated those days to the honor of God. The first time Adam witnessed the sinking of the sun be was also seized with anxious fears. It happened at the conclusion of the Sabbath, and Adam said, \"Woe is me! For my sake, because I sinned, the world is darkened, and it will again become void and without form. Thus will be executed the punishment of death which God has pronounced against me!\" All the night he spent in tears, and Eve, too, wept as she sat opposite to him. When day began to dawn, he understood that what he had deplored was but the course of nature, and he brought an offering unto God, a unicorn whose horn was created before his hoofs, and he sacrificed it on the spot on which later the altar was to stand in Jerusalem.",

      "content": "After Adam's expulsion from Paradise, he prayed to God in these words: \"O God, Lord of the world! Thou didst create the whole world unto the honor and glory of the Mighty One, and Thou didst as was pleasing unto Thee. Thy kingdom is unto all eternity, and Thy reign unto all generations. Naught is hidden from Thee, and naught is concealed from Thine eyes. Thou didst create me as Thy handiwork, and didst make me the ruler over Thy creatures, that I might be the chief of Thy works. But the cunning, accursed serpent seduced me with the tree of desire and lusts, yea, he seduced the wife of my bosom. But Thou didst not make known unto me what shall befall my children and the generations after me. I know well that no human being can be righteous in Thine eyes, and what is my strength that I should step before Thee with an impudent face? I have no mouth wherewith to speak and no eye wherewith to see, for I did sin and commit a trespass, and, by reason of my sins, I was driven forth from Paradise. I must plough the earth whence I was taken, and the other inhabitants of the earth, the beasts, no longer, as once, stand in awe and fear of me. From the time I ate of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, wisdom departed from me, and I am a fool that knoweth naught, an ignorant man that understandeth not. Now, O merciful and gracious God, I pray to Thee to turn again Thy compassion to the head of Thy works, to the spirit which Thou didst instil into him, and the soul Thou didst breathe into him. Meet me with Thy grace, for Thou art gracious, slow to anger, and full of love. O that my prayer would reach unto the throne of Thy glory, and my supplication unto the throne of Thy mercy, and Thou wouldst incline to me with lovingkindness. May the words of my mouth be acceptable, that Thou turn not away from my petition. Thou wert from everlasting, and Thou wilt be unto everlasting; Thou wert king, and Thou wilt ever be king. Now, have Thou mercy upon the work of Thy hands. Grant me knowledge and understanding, that I may know what shall befall me, and my posterity, and all the generations that come after me, and what shall befall me on every day and in every month, and mayest Thou not withhold from me the help of Thy servants and of Thy angels.\" On the third day after he had offered up this prayer, while he was sitting on the banks of the river that flows forth out of Paradise, there appeared to him, in the heat of the day, the angel Raziel, bearing a book in his hand. The angel addressed Adam thus: \"O Adam, why art thou so fainthearted? Why art thou distressed and anxious? Thy words were heard at the moment when thou didst utter thy supplication and entreaties, and I have received the charge to teach thee pure words and deep understanding, to make thee wise through the contents of the sacred book in my hand, to know what will happen to thee until the day of thy death. And all thy descendants and all the later generations, if they will but read this book in purity, with a devout heart and an humble mind, and obey its precepts, will become like unto thee. They, too, will foreknow what things shall happen, and in what month and on what day or in what night. All will be manifest to them—they will know and understand whether a calamity will come, a famine or wild beasts, floods or drought; whether there will be abundance of grain or dearth; whether the wicked will rule the world; whether locusts will devastate the land; whether the fruits will drop from the trees unripe; whether boils will afflict men; whether wars will prevail, or diseases or plagues among men and cattle; whether good is resolved upon in heaven, or evil; whether blood will flow, and the death-rattle of the slain be heard in the city. And now, Adam, come and give heed unto what I shall tell thee regarding the manner of this book and its holiness.\" Raziel, the angel, then read from the book, and when Adam heard the words of the holy volume as they issued from the mouth of the angel, he fell down affrighted. But the angel encouraged him. \"Arise, Adam,\" he said, \"be of good courage, be not afraid, take the book from me and keep it, for thou wilt draw knowledge from it thyself and become wise, and thou wilt also teach its contents to all those who shall be found worthy of knowing what it contains.\" In the moment when Adam took the book, a flame of fire shot up from near the river, and the angel rose heavenward with it. Then Adam knew that he who had spoken to him was an angel of God, and it was from the Holy King Himself that the book had come, and he used it in holiness and purity. It is the book out of which all things worth knowing can be learnt, and all mysteries, and it teaches also how to call upon the angels and make them appear before men, and answer all their questions. But not all alike can use the book, only he who is wise and God-fearing, and resorts to it in holiness. Such an one is secure against all wicked counsels, his life is serene, and when death takes him from this world, he finds repose in a place where there are neither demons nor evil spirits, and out of the hands of the wicked he is quickly rescued.",

He summoned all his descendants, and assembled them before the door of the house of worship in which he had always offered his prayers to God, to give them his last blessing. His family were astonished to find him stretched out on the bed of sickness, for they did not know what pain and suffering were. They thought he was overcome with longing after the fruits of Paradise, and for lack of them was depressed. Seth announced his willingness to go to the gates of Paradise and beg God to let one of His angels give him of its fruits. But Adam explained to them what sickness and pain are, and that God had inflicted them upon him as a punishment for his sin. Adam suffered violently; tears and groans were wrung from him. Eve sobbed, and said, \"Adam, my lord, give me the half of thy sickness, I will gladly bear it. Is it not on account of me that this hath come upon thee? On account of me thou undergoest pain and anguish.\" Adam bade Eve go with Seth to the gates of Paradise and entreat God to have mercy upon him, and send His angel to catch up some of the oil of life flowing from the tree of His mercy and give it to his messengers. The ointment would bring him rest, and banish the pain consuming him. On his way to Paradise, Seth was attacked by a wild beast. Eve called out to the assailant, \"How durst thou lay hand on the image of God?\" The ready answer came: \"It is thine own fault. Hadst thou not opened thy mouth to eat of the forbidden fruit, my mouth would not be opened now to destroy a human being.\" But Seth remonstrated: \"Hold thy tongue! Desist from the image of God until the day of judgment.\" And the beast gave way, saying, \"See, I refrain myself from the image of God,\" and it slunk away to its covert. Arrived at the gates of Paradise, Eve and Seth began to cry bitterly, and they besought God with many lamentations to give them oil from the tree of His mercy. For hours they prayed thus. At last the archangel Michael appeared, and informed them that he came as the messenger of God to tell them that their petition could not be granted. Adam would die in a few days, and as he was subject to death, so would be all his descendants. Only at the time of the resurrection, and then only to the pious, the oil of life would be dispensed, together with all the bliss and all the delights of Paradise. Returned to Adam, they reported what had happened, and he said to Eve: \"What misfortune didst thou bring upon us when thou didst arouse great wrath! See, death is the portion of all our race! Call hither our children and our children's children, and tell them the manner of our sinning.\" And while Adam lay prostrate upon the bed of pain, Eve told them the story of their fall.",

      "content": "After I was created, God divided Paradise and all the animals therein between Adam and me. The east and the north were assigned to Adam, together with the male animals. I was mistress of the west and the south and all the female animals. Satan, smarting under the disgrace of having been dismissed from the heavenly host, resolved to bring about our ruin and avenge himself upon the cause of his discomfiture. He won the serpent over to his side, and pointed out to him that before the creation of Adam the animals could enjoy all that grew in Paradise, and now they were restricted to the weeds. To drive Adam from Paradise would therefore be for the good of all. The serpent demurred, for he stood in awe of the wrath of God. But Satan calmed his fears, and said, \"Do thou but become my vessel, and I shall speak a word through thy mouth wherewith thou wilt succeed in seducing man.\" The serpent thereupon suspended himself from the wall surrounding Paradise, to carry on his conversation with me from without. And this happened at the very moment when my two guardian angels had betaken themselves to heaven to supplicate the Lord. I was quite alone therefore, and when Satan assumed the appearance of an angel, bent over the wall of Paradise, and intoned seraphic songs of praise, I was deceived, and thought him an angel. A conversation was held between us, Satan speaking through the mouth of the serpent: \"Art thou Eve?\" \"Yes, it is I.\" \"What art thou doing in Paradise?\" \"The Lord has put us here to cultivate it and eat of its fruits.\" \"That is good. Yet you eat not of all the trees.\" \"That we do, excepting a single one, the tree that stands in the midst of Paradise. Concerning it alone, God has forbidden us to eat of it, else, the Lord said, ye will die.\" The serpent made every effort to persuade me that I had naught to fear—that God knew that in the day that Adam and I ate of the fruit of the tree, we should be as He Himself. It was jealousy that had made Him say, \"Ye shall not eat of it.\" In spite of all his urging, I remained steadfast and refused to touch the tree. Then the serpent engaged to pluck the fruit for me. Thereupon I opened the gate of Paradise, and he slipped in. Scarcely was he within, when he said to me, \"I repent of my words, I would rather not give thee of the fruit of the forbidden tree.\" It was but a cunning device to tempt me more. He consented to give me of the fruit only after I swore to make my husband eat of it, too. This is the oath he made me take: \"By the throne of God, by the cherubim, and by the tree of life, I shall give my husband of this fruit, that he may eat, too.\" Thereupon the serpent ascended the tree and injected his poison, the poison of the evil inclination, into the fruit, and bent the branch on which it grew to the ground. I took hold of it, but I knew at once that I was stripped of the righteousness in which I had been clothed. I began to weep, because of it and because of the oath the serpent had forced from me. The serpent disappeared from the tree, while I sought leaves wherewith to cover my nakedness, but all the trees within my reach had cast off their leaves at the moment when I ate of the forbidden fruit. There was only one that retained its leaves, the fig-tree, the very tree the fruit of which had been forbidden to me. I summoned Adam, and by means of blasphemous words I prevailed upon him to eat of the fruit. As soon as it had passed his lips, he knew his true condition, and he exclaimed against me: \"Thou wicked woman, what bast thou brought down upon me? Thou hast removed me from the glory of God.\" At the same time Adam and I heard the archangel Michael blow his trumpet, and all the angels cried out: \"Thus saith the Lord, Come ye with Me to Paradise and hearken unto the sentence which I will pronounce upon Adam.\" We hid ourselves because we feared the judgment of God. Sitting in his chariot drawn by cherubim, the Lord, accompanied by angels uttering His praise, appeared in Paradise. At His coming the bare trees again put forth leaves. His throne was erected by the tree of life, and God addressed Adam: \"Adam, where dost thou keep thyself in hiding? Thinkest thou I cannot find thee? Can a house conceal itself from its architect?\" Adam tried to put the blame on me, who had promised to hold him harmless before God. And I in turn accused the serpent. But God dealt out justice to all three of us. To Adam He said: \"Because thou didst not obey My commands, but didst hearken unto the voice of thy wife, cursed is the ground in spite of thy work. When thou dost cultivate it, it will not yield thee its strength. Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread. Thou wilt suffer many a hardship, thou wilt grow weary, and yet find no rest. Bitterly oppressed, thou shalt never taste of any sweetness. Thou shalt be scourged by heat, and yet pinched by cold. Thou shalt toil greatly, and yet not gain wealth. Thou shalt grow fat, and yet cease to live. And the animals over which thou art the master will rise up against thee, because thou didst not keep my command.\" Upon me God pronounced this sentence: \"Thou shalt suffer anguish in childbirth and grievous torture. In sorrow shalt thou bring forth children, and in the hour of travail, when thou art near to lose thy life, thou wilt confess and cry, 'Lord, Lord, save me this time, and I will never again indulge in carnal pleasure,' and yet thy desire shall ever and ever be unto thy husband.\" At the same time all sorts of diseases were decreed upon us. God said to Adam: \"Because thou didst turn aside from My covenant, I will inflict seventy plagues upon thy flesh. The pain of the first plague shall lay hold on thy eyes; the pain of the second plague upon thy hearing, and one after the other all the plagues shall come upon thee.\" The serpent God addressed thus: \"Because thou becamest the vessel of the Evil One, deceiving the innocent, cursed art thou above all cattle and above every beast of the field. Thou shalt be robbed of the food thou wast wont to eat, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. Upon thy breast and thy belly shalt thou go, and of thy hands and thy feet thou shalt be deprived. Thou shalt not remain in possession of thy ears, nor of thy wings, nor of any of thy limbs wherewith thou didst seduce the woman and her husband, bringing them to such a pass that they must be driven forth from Paradise. And I will put enmity between thee and the seed of man. It shall bruise thy head, and, thou shalt bruise his heel until the day of judgment.\"",

      "content": "On the last day of Adam's life, Eve said to him, \"Why should I go on living, when thou art no more? How long shall I have to linger on after thy death? Tell me this!\" Adam assured her she would not tarry long. They would die together, and be buried together in the same place. He commanded her not to touch his corpse until an angel from God had made provision regarding it, and she was to begin at once to pray to God until his soul escaped from his body. While Eve was on her knees in prayer, an angel came, and bade her rise. \"Eve, arise from thy penance,\" he commanded. \"Behold, thy husband hath left his mortal coil. Arise, and see his spirit go up to his Creator, to appear before Him.\" And, lo, she beheld a chariot of light, drawn by four shining eagles, and preceded by angels. In this chariot lay the soul of Adam, which the angels were taking to heaven. Arrived there, they burnt incense until the clouds of smoke enveloped the heavens. Then they prayed to God to have mercy upon His image and the work of His holy hands. In her awe and fright, Eve summoned Seth, and she bade him look upon the vision and explain the celestial sights beyond her understanding. She asked, \"Who may the two Ethiopians be, who are adding their prayers to thy father's?\" Seth told her, they were the sun and the moon, turned so black because they could not shine in the face of the Father of light. Scarcely had he spoken, when an angel blew a trumpet, and all the angels cried out with awful voices, \"Blessed be the glory of the Lord by His creatures, for He has shown mercy unto Adam, the work of His hands!\" A seraph then seized Adam, and carried him off to the river Acheron, washed him three times, and brought him before the presence of God, who sat upon His throne, and, stretching out His hand, lifted Adam up and gave him over to the archangel Michael, with the words, \"Raise him to the Paradise of the third heaven, and there thou shalt leave him until the great and fearful day ordained by Me.\" Michael executed the Divine behest, and all the angels sang a song of praise, extolling God for the pardon He had accorded Adam. Michael now entreated God to let him attend to the preparation of Adam's body for the grave. Permission being given, Michael repaired to earth, accompanied by all the angels. When they entered the terrestrial Paradise, all the trees blossomed forth, and the perfume wafted thence lulled all men into slumber except Seth alone. Then God said to Adam, as his body lay on the ground: \"If thou hadst kept My commandment, they would not rejoice who brought thee hither. But I tell thee, I will turn the joy of Satan and his consorts into sorrow, and thy sorrow shall be turned into joy. I will restore thee to thy dominion, and thou shalt sit upon the throne of thy seducer, while he shall be damned, with those who hearken unto him.\" Thereupon, at the bidding of God, the three great archangels covered the body of Adam with linen, and poured sweet-smelling oil upon it. With it they interred also the body of Abel, which had lain unburied since Cain had slain him, for all the murderer's efforts to hide it had been in vain. The corpse again and again sprang forth from the earth, and a voice issued thence, proclaiming, \"No creature shall rest in the earth until the first one of all has returned the dust to me of which it was formed.\" The angels carried the two bodies to Paradise, Adam's and Abel's—the latter had all this time been lying on a stone on which angels had placed it—and they buried them both on the spot whence God had taken the dust wherewith to make Adam. God called unto the body of Adam, \"Adam! Adam!\" and it answered, \"Lord, here am I!\" Then God said: \"I told thee once, Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. Now I promise thee resurrection. I will awaken thee on the day of judgment, when all the generations of men that spring from thy loins, shall arise from the grave.\" God then sealed up the grave, that none might do him harm during the six days to elapse until his rib should be restored to him through the death of Eve.",

      "content": "The interval between Adam's death and her own Eve spent in weeping. She was distressed in particular that she knew not what had become of Adam's body, for none except Seth had been awake while the angel interred it. When the hour of her death drew nigh, Eve supplicated to be buried in the selfsame spot in which the remains of her husband rested. She prayed to God: \"Lord of all powers! Remove not Thy maid-servant from the body of Adam, from which Thou didst take me, from whose limbs Thou didst form me. Permit me, who am an unworthy and sinning woman, to enter into his habitation. As we were together in Paradise, neither separated from the other; as together we were tempted to transgress Thy law, neither separated from the other, so, O Lord, separate us not now.\" To the end of her prayer she added the petition, raising her eyes heavenward, \"Lord of the world! Receive my spirit!\" and she gave up her soul to God. The archangel Michael came and taught Seth how to prepare Eve for burial, and three angels descended and interred her body in the grave with Adam and Abel. Then Michael spoke to Seth, \"Thus shalt thou bury all men that die until the resurrection day.\" And again, having given him this command, he spoke: \"Longer than six days ye shall not mourn. The repose of the seventh day is the token of the resurrection in the latter day, for on the seventh day the Lord rested from all the work which He had created and made.\" Though death was brought into the world through Adam, yet he cannot be held responsible for the death of men. Once on a time he said to God: \"I am not concerned about the death of the wicked, but I should not like the pious to reproach me and lay the blame for their death upon me. I pray Thee, make no mention of my guilt.\" And God promised to fulfil his wish. Therefore, when a man is about to die, God appears to him, and bids him set down in writing all he has done during his life, for, He tells him, \"Thou art dying by reason of thy evil deeds.\" The record finished, God orders him to seal it with his seal. This is the writing God will bring out on the judgment day, and to each will be made known his deeds. As soon as life is extinct in a man, he is presented to Adam, whom he accuses of having caused his death. But Adam repudiates the charge: \"I committed but one trespass. Is there any among you, and be he the most pious, who has not been guilty of more than one?\"",

      "content": "There were ten generations from Adam to Noah, to show how long-suffering is the Lord, for all the generations provoked Him unto wrath, until He brought the deluge upon them. By reason of their impiousness God changed His plan of calling one thousand generations into being between the creation of the world and the revelation of the law at Mount Sinai; nine hundred and seventy-four He suppressed before the flood. Wickedness came into the world with the first being born of woman, Cain, the oldest son of Adam. When God bestowed Paradise upon the first pair of mankind, He warned them particularly against carnal intercourse with each other. But after the fall of Eve, Satan, in the guise of the serpent, approached her, and the fruit of their union was Cain, the ancestor of all the impious generations that were rebellious toward God, and rose up against Him. Cain's descent from Satan, who is the angel Samael, was revealed in his seraphic appearance. At his birth, the exclamation was wrung from Eve, \"I have gotten a man through an angel of the Lord.\" Adam was not in the company of Eve during the time of her pregnancy with Cain. After she had succumbed a second time to the temptations of Satan, and permitted herself to be interrupted in her penance, she left her husband and journeyed westward, because she feared her presence might continue to bring him misery. Adam remained in the east. When the days of Eve to be delivered were fulfilled, and she began to feel the pangs of travailing, she prayed to God for help. But He hearkened not unto her supplications. \"Who will carry the report to my lord Adam?\" she asked herself. \"Ye luminaries in the sky, I beg you, tell it to my master Adam when ye return to the east!\" In that self same hour, Adam cried out: \"The lamentation of Eve has pierced to my ear! Mayhap the serpent has again assaulted her,\" and he hastened to his wife. Finding her in grievous pain, he besought God in her behalf, and twelve angels appeared, together with two heavenly powers. All these took up their post to right of her and to left of her, while Michael, also standing on her right side, passed his hand over her, from her face downward to her breast, and said to her, \"Be thou blessed, Eve, for the sake of Adam. Because of his solicitations and his prayers I was sent to grant thee our assistance. Make ready to give birth to thy child!\" Immediately her son was born, a radiant figure. A little while and the babe stood upon his feet, ran off, and returned holding in his hands a stalk of straw, which he gave to his mother. For this reason he was named Cain, the Hebrew word for stalk of straw. Now Adam took Eve and the boy to his home in the east. God sent him various kinds of seeds by the hand of the angel Michael, and he was taught how to cultivate the ground and make it yield produce and fruits, to sustain himself and his family and his posterity. After a while, Eve bore her second son, whom she named Hebel, because, she said, he was born but to die.",

      "content": "The slaying of Abel by Cain did not come as a wholly unexpected event to his parents. In a dream Eve had seen the blood of Abel flow into the mouth of Cain, who drank it with avidity, though his brother entreated him not to take all. When she told her dream to Adam, he said, lamenting, \"O that this may not portend the death of Abel at the hand of Cain!\" He separated the two lads, assigning to each an abode of his own, and to each he taught a different occupation. Cain became a tiller of the ground, and Abel a keeper of sheep. It was all in vain. In spite of these precautions, Cain slew his brother. His hostility toward Abel had more than one reason. It began when God had respect unto the offering of Abel, and accepted it by sending heavenly fire down to consume it, while the offering of Cain was rejected. They brought their sacrifices on the fourteenth day of Nisan, at the instance of their father, who had spoken thus to his sons: \"This is the day on which, in times to come, Israel will offer sacrifices. Therefore, do ye, too, bring sacrifices to your Creator on this day, that He may take pleasure in you.\" The place of offering which they chose was the spot whereon the altar of the Temple at Jerusalem stood later. Abel selected the best of his flocks for his sacrifice, but Cain ate his meal first, and after he had satisfied his appetite, he offered unto God what was left over, a few grains of flax seed. As though his offense had not been great enough in offering unto God fruit of the ground which had been cursed by God! What wonder that his sacrifice was not received with favor! Besides, a chastisement was inflicted upon him. His face turned black as smoke. Nevertheless, his disposition underwent no change, even when God spoke to him thus: \"If thou wilt amend thy ways, thy guilt will be forgiven thee; if not, thou wilt be delivered into the power of the evil inclination. It coucheth at the door of thy heart, yet it depends upon thee whether thou shalt be master over it, or it shall be master over thee.\" Cain thought he had been wronged, and a dispute followed between him and Abel. \"I believed,\" he said, \"that the world was created through goodness, but I see that good deeds bear no fruit. God rules the world with arbitrary power, else why had He respect unto thy offering, and not unto mine also?\" Abel opposed him; he maintained that God rewards good deeds, without having respect unto persons. If his sacrifice had been accepted graciously by God, and Cain's not, it was because his deeds were good, and his brother's wicked. But this was not the only cause of Cain's hatred toward Abel. Partly love for a woman brought about the crime. To ensure the propagation of the human race, a girl, destined to be his wife, was born together with each of the sons of Adam. Abel's twin sister was of exquisite beauty, and Cain desired her. Therefore he was constantly brooding over ways and means of ridding himself of his brother. The opportunity presented itself ere long. One day a sheep belonging to Abel tramped over a field that had been planted by Cain. In a rage, the latter called out, \"What right hast thou to live upon my land and let thy sheep pasture yonder?\" Abel retorted: \"What right hast thou to use the products of my sheep, to make garments for thyself from their wool? If thou wilt take off the wool of my sheep wherein thou art arrayed, and wilt pay me for the flesh of the flocks which thou hast eaten, then I will quit thy land as thou desirest, and fly into the air, if I can do it.\" Cain thereupon said, \"And if I were to kill thee, who is there to demand thy blood of me?\" Abel replied: \"God, who brought us into the world, will avenge me. He will require my blood at thine hand, if thou shouldst slay me. God is the Judge, who will visit their wicked deeds upon the wicked, and their evil deeds upon the evil. Shouldst thou slay me, God will know thy secret, and He will deal out punishment unto thee.\" These words but added to the anger of Cain, and he threw himself upon his brother. Abel was stronger than he, and he would have got the worst of it, but at the last moment he begged for mercy, and the gentle Abel released his hold upon him. Scarcely did he feel himself free, when he turned against Abel once more, and slew him. So true is the saying, \"Do the evil no good, lest evil fall upon thee.\"",

      "content": "The manner of Abel's death was the most cruel conceivable. Not knowing what injury was fatal, Cain pelted all parts of his body with stones, until one struck him on the neck and inflicted death. After committing the murder, Cain resolved to flee, saying, \"My parents will demand account of me concerning Abel, for there is no other human being on earth.\" This thought had but passed through his mind when God appeared unto him, and addressed him in these words: \"Before thy parents thou canst flee, but canst thou go out from My presence, too? 'Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him?' Alas for Abel that he showed thee mercy, and refrained from killing thee, when he had thee in his power! Alas that he granted thee the opportunity of slaying him!\" Questioned by God, \"Where is Abel thy brother?\" Cain answered: \"Am I my brother's keeper? Thou art He who holdest watch over all creatures, and yet Thou demandest account of me! True, I slew him, but Thou didst create the evil inclination in me. Thou guardest all things; why, then, didst Thou permit me to slay him? Thou didst Thyself slay him, for hadst Thou looked with a favorable countenance toward my offering as toward his, I had had no reason for envying him, and I had not slain him.\" But God said, \"The voice of thy brother's blood issuing from his many wounds crieth out against thee, and likewise the blood of all the pious who might have sprung from the loins of Abel.\" Also the soul of Abel denounced the murderer, for she could find rest nowhere. She could neither soar heavenward, nor abide in the grave with her body, for no human soul had done either before. But Cain still refused to confess his guilt. He insisted that he had never seen a man killed, and how was he to suppose that the stones which he threw at Abel would take his life? Then, on account of Cain, God cursed the ground, that it might not yield fruit unto him. With a single punishment both Cain and the earth were chastised, the earth because it retained the corpse of Abel, and did not cast it above ground. In the obduracy of his heart, Cain spake: \"O Lord of the world! Are there informers who denounce men before Thee? My parents are the only living human beings, and they know naught of my deed. Thou abidest in the heavens, and how shouldst Thou know what things happen on earth?\" God said in reply: \"Thou fool! I carry the whole world. I have made it, and I will bear it\"—a reply that gave Cain the opportunity of feigning repentance. \"Thou bearest the whole world,\" he said, \"and my sin Thou canst not bear? Verily, mine iniquity is too great to be borne! Yet, yesterday Thou didst banish my father from Thy presence, to-day Thou dost banish me. In sooth, it will be said, it is Thy way to banish.\" Although this was but dissimulation, and not true repentance, yet God granted Cain pardon, and removed the half of his chastisement from him. Originally, the decree had condemned him to be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth. Now he was no longer to roam about forever, but a fugitive he was to remain. And so much was hard enough to have to suffer, for the earth quaked under Cain, and all the animals, the wild and the tame, among them the accursed serpent, gathered together and essayed to devour him in order to avenge the innocent blood of Abel. Finally Cain could bear it no longer, and, breaking out in tears, he cried: \"Whither shall I go from Thy spirit? Or whither shall I flee from Thy presence?\" To protect him from the onslaught of the beasts, God inscribed one letter of His Holy Name upon his forehead, and furthermore He addressed the animals: \"Cain's punishment shall not be like unto the punishment of future murderers. He has shed blood, but there was none to give him instruction. Henceforth, however, he who slays another shall himself be slain.\" Then God gave him the dog as a protection against the wild beasts, and to mark him as a sinner, He afflicted him with leprosy. Cain's repentance, insincere though it was, bore a good result. When Adam met him, and inquired what doom had been decreed against him, Cain told how his repentance had propitiated God, and Adam exclaimed, \"So potent is repentance, and I knew it not!\" Thereupon he composed a hymn of praise to God, beginning with the words, \"It is a good thing to confess thy sins unto the Lord!\" The crime committed by Cain had baneful consequences, not for himself alone, but for the whole of nature also. Before, the fruits which the earth bore unto him when he tilled the ground had tasted like the fruits of Paradise. Now his labor produced naught but thorns and thistles. The ground changed and deteriorated at the very moment of Abel's violent end. The trees and the plants in the part of the earth whereon the victim lived refused to yield their fruits, on account of their grief over him, and only at the birth of Seth those that grew in the portion belonging to Abel began to flourish and bear again. But never did they resume their former powers. While, before, the vine had borne nine hundred and twenty-six different varieties of fruit, it now brought forth but one kind. And so it was with all other species. They will regain their pristine powers only in the world to come. Nature was modified also by the burial of the corpse of Abel. For a long time it lay there exposed, above ground, because Adam and Eve knew not what to do with it. They sat beside it and wept, while the faithful dog of Abel kept guard that birds and beasts did it no harm. On a sudden, the mourning parents observed how a raven scratched the earth away in one spot, and then hid a dead bird of his own kind in the ground. Adam, following the example of the raven, buried the body of Abel, and the raven was rewarded by God. His young are born with white feathers, wherefore the old birds desert them, not recognizing them as their offspring. They take them for serpents. God feeds them until their plumage turns black, and the parent birds return to them. As an additional reward, God grants their petition when the ravens pray for rain.",

      "content": "When Adam was cast out of Paradise, he first reached the lowest of the seven earths, the Erez, which is dark, without a ray of light, and utterly void. Adam was terrified, particularly by the flames of the ever-turning sword, which is on this earth. After he had done penance, God led him to the second earth, the Adamah, where there is light reflected from its own sky and from its phantom-like stars and constellations. Here dwell the phantom-like beings that issued from the union of Adam with the spirits. They are always sad; the emotion of joy is not known to them. They leave their own earth and repair to the one inhabited by men, where they are changed into evil spirits. Then they return to their abode for good, repent of their wicked deeds, and till the ground, which, however, bears neither wheat nor any other of the seven species. In this Adamah, Cain, Abel, and Seth were born. After the murder of Abel, Cain was sent back to the Erez, where he was frightened into repentance by its darkness and by the flames of the ever-turning sword. Accepting his penitence, God permitted him to ascend to the third earth, the Arka, which receives some light from the sun. The Arka was surrendered to the Cainites forever, as their perpetual domain. They till the ground, and plant trees, but they have neither wheat nor any other of the seven species. Some of the Cainites are giants, some of them are dwarfs. They have two heads, wherefore they can never arrive at a decision; they are always at loggerheads with themselves. It may happen that they are pious now, only to be inclined to do evil the next moment. In the Ge, the fourth earth, live the generation of the Tower of Babel and their descendants. God banished them thither because the fourth earth is not far from Gehenna, and therefore close to the flaming fire. The inhabitants of the Ge are skilful in all arts, and accomplished in all departments of science and knowledge, and their abode overflows with wealth. When an inhabitant of our earth visits them, they give him the most precious thing in their possession, but then they lead him to the Neshiah, the fifth earth, where he becomes oblivious of his origin and his home. The Neshiah is inhabited by dwarfs without noses; they breathe through two holes instead. They have no memory; once a thing has happened, they forget it completely, whence their earth is called Neshiah, \"forgetting.\" The fourth and fifth earths are like the Arka; they have trees, but neither wheat nor any other of the seven species. The sixth earth, the Ziah, is inhabited by handsome men, who are the owners of abundant wealth, and live in palatial residences, but they lack water, as the name of their territory, Ziah, \"drought,\" indicates. Hence vegetation is sparse with them, and their tree culture meets with indifferent success. They hasten to any waterspring that is discovered, and sometimes they succeed in slipping through it up to our earth, where they satisfy their sharp appetite for the food eaten by the inhabitants of our earth. For the rest, they are men of steadfast faith, more than any other class of mankind. Adam remained in the Adamah until after the birth of Seth. Then, passing the third earth, the Arka, the abiding place of the Cainites, and the next three earths as well, the Ge, the Neshiah, and the Ziah, God transported him to the Tebel, the seventh earth, the earth inhabited by men.",

      "content": "Cain knew only too well that his blood-guiltiness would be visited upon him in the seventh generation. Thus had God decreed against him. He endeavored, therefore, to immortalize his name by means of monuments, and he became a builder of cities. The first of them he called Enoch, after his son, because it was at the birth of Enoch that he began to enjoy a measure of rest and peace. Besides, he founded six other cities. This building of cities was a godless deed, for he surrounded them with a wall, forcing his family to remain within. All his other doings were equally impious. The punishment God had ordained for him did not effect any improvement. He sinned in order to secure his own pleasure, though his neighbors suffered injury thereby. He augmented his household substance by rapine and violence; he excited his acquaintances to procure pleasures and spoils by robbery, and he became a great leader of men into wicked courses. He also introduced a change in the ways of simplicity wherein men had lived before, and he was the author of measures and weights. And whereas men lived innocently and generously while they knew nothing of such arts, he changed the world into cunning craftiness. Like unto Cain were all his descendants, impious and godless, wherefore God resolved to destroy them. The end of Cain overtook him in the seventh generation of men, and it was inflicted upon him by the hand of his great-grandson Lamech. This Lamech was blind, and when he went a-hunting, he was led by his young son, who would apprise his father when game came in sight, and Lamech would then shoot at it with his bow and arrow. Once upon a time he and his son went on the chase, and the lad discerned something horned in the distance. He naturally took it to be a beast of one kind or another, and he told the blind Lamech to let his arrow fly. The aim was good, and the quarry dropped to the ground. When they came close to the victim, the lad exclaimed: \"Father, thou hast killed something that resembles a human being in all respects, except it carries a horn on its forehead!\" Lamech knew at once what had happened—he had killed his ancestor Cain, who had been marked by God with a horn. In despair he smote his hands together, inadvertently killing his son as he clasped them. Misfortune still followed upon misfortune. The earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the four generations sprung from Cain—Enoch, Irad, Mehujael, and Methushael. Lamech, sightless as he was, could not go home; he had to remain by the side of Cain's corpse and his son's. Toward evening, his wives, seeking him, found him there. When they heard what he had done, they wanted to separate from him, all the more as they knew that whoever was descended from Cain was doomed to annihilation. But Lamech argued, \"If Cain, who committed murder of malice aforethought, was punished only in the seventh generation, then I, who had no intention of killing a human being, may hope that retribution will be averted for seventy and seven generations.\" With his wives, Lamech repaired to Adam, who heard both parties, and decided the case in favor of Lamech. The corruptness of the times, and especially the depravity of Cain's stock, appears in the fact that Lamech, as well as all the men in the generation of the deluge, married two wives, one with the purpose of rearing children, the other in order to pursue carnal indulgences, for which reason the latter was rendered sterile by artificial means. As the men of the time were intent upon pleasure rather than desirous of doing their duty to the human race, they gave all their love and attention to the barren women, while their other wives spent their days like widows, joyless and in gloom. The two wives of Lamech, Adah and Zillah, bore him each two children, Adah two sons, Jabal and Jubal, and Zillah a son, Tubal-cain, and a daughter, Naamah. Jabal was the first among men to erect temples to idols, and Jubal invented the music sung and played therein. Tubal-cain was rightly named, for he completed the work of his ancestor Cain. Cain committed murder, and Tubal-cain, the first who knew how to sharpen iron and copper, furnished the instruments used in wars and combats. Naamah, \"the lovely,\" earned her name from the sweet sounds which she drew from her cymbals when she called the worshippers to pay homage to idols.",

      "content": "When the wives of Lamech heard the decision of Adam, that they were to continue to live with their husband, they turned upon him, saying, \"O physician, heal thine own lameness!\" They were alluding to the fact that he himself had been living apart from his wife since the death of Abel, for he had said, \"Why should I beget children, if it is but to expose them to death?\" Though he avoided intercourse with Eve, he was visited in his sleep by female spirits, and from his union with them sprang shades and demons of various kinds, and they were endowed with peculiar gifts. Once upon a time there lived in Palestine a very rich and pious man, who had a son named Rabbi Hanina. He knew the whole of the Torah by heart. When he was at the point of death, he sent for his son, Rabbi Hanina, and bade him, as his last request, to study the Torah day and night, fulfil the commands of the law, and be a faithful friend to the poor. He also told him that he and his wife, the mother of Rabbi Hanina, would die on the selfsame day, and the seven days of mourning for the two would end on the eve of the Passover. He enjoined him not to grieve excessively, but to go to market on that day, and buy the first article offered to him, no matter how costly it might be. If it happened to be an edible, he was to prepare it and serve it with much ceremony. His expense and trouble would receive their recompense. All happened as foretold: the man and his wife died upon the same day, and the end of the week of mourning coincided with the eve of the Passover. The son in turn carried out his father's behest: he repaired to market, and there he met an old man who offered a silver dish for sale. Although the price asked was exorbitant, yet he bought it, as his father had bidden. The dish was set upon the Seder table, and when Rabbi Hanina opened it, he found a second dish within, and inside of this a live frog, jumping and hopping around gleefully. He gave the frog food and drink, and by the end of the festival he was grown so big that Rabbi Hanina made a cabinet for him, in which he ate and lived. In the course of time, the cabinet became too small, and the Rabbi built a chamber, put the frog within, and gave him abundant food and drink. All this he did that he might not violate his father's last wish. But the frog waxed and grew; he consumed all his host owned, until, finally, Rabbi Hanina was stripped bare of all his possessions. Then the frog opened his mouth and began to speak. \"My dear Rabbi Hanina,\" he said, \"do not worry! Seeing thou didst raise me and care for me, thou mayest ask of me whatever thy heart desireth, and it shall be granted thee.\" Rabbi Hanina made reply, \"I desire naught but that thou shouldst teach me the whole of the Torah.\" The frog assented, and he did, indeed, teach him the whole of the Torah, and the seventy languages of men besides. His method was to write a few words upon a scrap of paper, which he had his pupil swallow. Thus he acquired not alone the Torah and the seventy tongues, but also the language of beasts and birds. Thereupon the frog spoke to the wife of Rabbi Hanina: \"Thou didst tend me well, and I have given thee no recompense. But thy reward will be paid thee before I depart from you, only you must both accompany me to the woods. There you shall see what I shall do for you.\" Accordingly, they went to the woods with him. Arrived there, the frog began to cry aloud, and at the sound all sorts of beasts and birds assembled. These he commanded to produce precious stones, as many as they could carry. Also they were to bring herbs and roots for the wife of Rabbi Hanina, and he taught her how to use them as remedies for all varieties of disease. All this they were bidden to take home with them. When they were about to return, the frog addressed them thus: \"May the Holy One, blessed be He, have mercy upon you, and requite you for all the trouble you took on my account, without so much as inquiring who I am. Now I shall make my origin known to you. I am the son of Adam, a son whom he begot during the hundred and thirty years of his separation from Eve. God has endowed me with the power of assuming any form or guise I desire.\" Rabbi Hanina and his wife departed for their home, and they became very rich, and enjoyed the respect and confidence of the king.",

      "content": "The exhortations of the wives of Lamech took effect upon Adam. After a separation of one hundred and thirty years, he returned to Eve, and the love he now bore her was stronger by far than in the former time. She was in his thoughts even when she was not present to him bodily. The fruit of their reunion was Seth, who was destined to be the ancestor of the Messiah. Seth was so formed from birth that the rite of circumcision could be dispensed with. He was thus one of the thirteen men born perfect in a way. Adam begot him in his likeness and image, different from Cain, who had not been in his likeness and image. Thus Seth became, in a genuine sense, the father of the human race, especially the father of the pious, while the depraved and godless are descended from Cain. Even during the lifetime of Adam the descendants of Cain became exceedingly wicked, dying successively, one after another, each more wicked than the former. They were intolerable in war, and vehement in robberies, and if any one were slow to murder people, yet was he bold in his profligate behavior in acting unjustly and doing injury for gain. Now as to Seth. When he was brought up, and came to those years in which he could discern what was good, he became a virtuous man, and as he was himself of excellent character, so he left children behind him who imitated his virtues. All these proved to be of good disposition. They also inhabited one and the same country without dissensions, and in a happy condition, without any misfortune's falling upon them, until they died. They also were the inventors of that peculiar sort of wisdom which is concerned with the heavenly bodies and their order. And that their inventions might not be lost before they were sufficiently known, they made two pillars, upon Adam's prediction that the world was to be destroyed at one time by the force of fire and at another time by the violence and quantity of water. The one was of brick, the other of stone, and they inscribed their discoveries on both, that in case the pillar of brick should be destroyed by the flood, the pillar of stone might remain, and exhibit these discoveries to mankind, and also inform them that there was another pillar, of brick, erected by them. ENOSH Enosh was asked who his father was, and he named Seth. The questioners, the people of his time, continued: \"Who was the father of Seth?\" Enosh: \"Adam.\"—\"And who was the father of Adam?\"—\"He had neither father nor mother, God formed him from the dust of the earth.\"—\"But man has not the appearance of dust!\"—\"After death man returns to dust, as God said, 'And man shall turn again unto dust;' but on the day of his creation, man was made in the image of God.\"—\"How was the woman created?\"—\"Male and female He created them.\"—\"But how?\"—\"God took water and earth, and moulded them together in the form of man.\"—\"But how?\" pursued the questioners. Enosh took six clods of earth, mixed them, and moulded them, and formed an image of dust and clay. \"But,\" said the people, \"this image does not walk, nor does it possess any breath of life.\" He then essayed to show them how God breathed the breath of life into the nostrils of Adam, but when he began to blow his breath into the image he had formed, Satan entered it, and the figure walked, and the people of his time who had been inquiring these matters of Enosh went astray after it, saying, \"What is the difference between bowing down before this image and paying homage to a man?\" The generation of Enosh were thus the first idol worshippers, and the punishment for their folly was not delayed long. God caused the sea to transgress its bounds, and a portion of the earth was flooded. This was the time also when the mountains became rocks, and the dead bodies of men began to decay. And still another consequence of the sin of idolatry was that the countenances of the men of the following generations were no longer in the likeness and image of God, as the countenances of Adam, Seth, and Enosh had been. They resembled centaurs and apes, and the demons lost their fear of men. But there was a still more serious consequence from the idolatrous practices introduced in the time of Enosh. When God drove Adam forth from Paradise, the Shekinah remained behind, enthroned above a cherub under the tree of life. The angels descended from heaven and repaired thither in hosts, to receive their instructions, and Adam and his descendants sat by the gate to bask in the splendor of the Shekinah, sixty-five thousand times more radiant than the splendor of the sun. This brightness of the Shekinah makes all upon whom it falls exempt from disease, and neither insects nor demons can come nigh unto them to do them harm. Thus it was until the time of Enosh, when men began to gather gold, silver, gems, and pearls from all parts of the earth, and made idols thereof a thousand parasangs high. What was worse, by means of the magic arts taught them by the angels Uzza and Azzael, they set themselves as masters over the heavenly spheres, and forced the sun, the moon, and the stars to be subservient to themselves instead of the Lord. This impelled the angels to ask God: \"'What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?' Why didst Thou abandon the highest of the heavens, the seat of Thy glory and Thy exalted Throne in 'Arabot, and descend to men, who pay worship to idols, putting Thee upon a level with them?\" The Shekinah was induced to leave the earth and ascend to heaven, amid the blare and flourish of the trumpets of the myriads of angel hosts.",

      "content": "The depravity of mankind, which began to show itself in the time of Enosh, had increased monstrously in the time of his grandson Jared, by reason of the fallen angels. When the angels saw the beautiful, attractive daughters of men, they lusted after them, and spoke: \"We will choose wives for ourselves only from among the daughters of men, and beget children with them.\" Their chief Shemhazai said, \"I fear me, ye will not put this plan of yours into execution, and I alone shall have to suffer the consequences of a great sin.\" Then they answered him, and said: \"We will all swear an oath, and we will bind ourselves, separately and together, not to abandon the plan, but to carry it through to the end.\" Two hundred angels descended to the summit of Mount Hermon, which owes its name to this very occurrence, because they bound themselves there to fulfil their purpose, on the penalty of Herem, anathema. Under the leadership of twenty captains they defiled themselves with the daughters of men, unto whom they taught charms, conjuring formulas, how to cut roots, and the efficacy of plants. The issue from these mixed marriages was a race of giants, three thousand ells tall, who consumed the possessions of men. When all had vanished, and they could obtain nothing more from them, the giants turned against men and devoured many of them, and the remnant of men began to trespass against the birds, beasts, reptiles, and fishes, eating their flesh and drinking their blood. Then the earth complained about the impious evil-doers. But the fallen angels continued to corrupt mankind. Azazel taught men how to make slaughtering knives, arms, shields, and coats of mail. He showed them metals and how to work them, and armlets and all sorts of trinkets, and the use of rouge for the eyes, and how to beautify the eyelids, and how to ornament themselves with the rarest and most precious jewels and all sorts of paints. The chief of the fallen angels, Shemhazai, instructed them in exorcisms and how to cut roots; Armaros taught them how to raise spells; Barakel, divination from the stars; Kawkabel, astrology; Ezekeel, augury from the clouds; Arakiel, the signs of the earth; Samsaweel, the signs of the sun; and Seriel, the signs of the moon. While all these abominations defiled the earth, the pious Enoch lived in a secret place. None among men knew his abode, or what had become of him, for he was sojourning with the angel watchers and holy ones. Once he heard the call addressed to him: \"Enoch, thou scribe of justice, go unto the watchers of the heavens, who have left the high heavens, the eternal place of holiness, defiling themselves with women, doing as men do, taking wives unto themselves, and casting themselves into the arms of destruction upon earth. Go and proclaim unto them that they shall find neither peace nor pardon. For every time they take joy in their offspring, they shall see the violent death of their sons, and sigh over the ruin of their children. They will pray and supplicate evermore, but never shall they attain to mercy or peace.\" Enoch repaired to Azazel and the other fallen angels, to announce the doom uttered against them. They all were filled with fear. Trembling seized upon them, and they implored Enoch to set up a petition for them and read it to the Lord of heaven, for they could not speak with God as aforetime, nor even raise their eyes heavenward, for shame on account of their sins. Enoch granted their request, and in a vision he was vouchsafed the answer which he was to carry back to the angels. It appeared to Enoch that he was wafted into heaven upon clouds, and was set down before the throne of God. God spake: \"Go forth and say to the watchers of heaven who have sent thee hither to intercede for them: Verily, it is you who ought to plead in behalf of men, not men in behalf of you I Why did ye forsake the high, holy, and eternal heavens, to pollute yourselves with the daughters of men, taking wives unto yourselves, doing like the races of the earth, and begetting giant sons? Giants begotten by flesh and spirits will be called evil spirits on earth, and on the earth will be their dwelling-place. Evil spirits proceed from their bodies, because they are created from above, and from the holy watchers is their beginning and primal origin; they will be evil spirits on earth, and evil spirits they will be named. And the spirits of heaven have their dwelling in heaven, but the spirits of the earth, which were born upon the earth, have their dwelling on the earth. And the spirits of the giants will devour, oppress, destroy, attack, do battle, and cause destruction on the earth, and work affliction. They will take no kind of food, nor will they thirst, and they will be invisible. And these spirits will rise up against the children of men and against the women, because they have proceeded from them. Since the days of murder and destruction and the death of the giants, when the spirits went forth from the soul of their flesh, in order to destroy without incurring judgment—thus will they destroy until the day when the great consummation of the great world be consummated. And now as to the watchers who have sent thee to intercede for them, who had been aforetime in heaven, say to them: You have been in heaven, and though the hidden things had not yet been revealed to you, you know worthless mysteries, and in the hardness of your hearts you have recounted these to the women, and through these mysteries women and men work much evil on earth. Say to them therefore: You have no peace!\"",

      "content": "After Enoch had lived a long time secluded from men, he once heard the voice of an angel calling to him: \"Enoch, Enoch, make thyself ready and leave the house and the secret place wherein thou hast kept thyself hidden, and assume dominion over men, to teach them the ways in which they shall walk, and the deeds which they shall do, in order that they may walk in the ways of God.\" Enoch left his retreat and betook himself to the haunts of men. He gathered them about him, and instructed them in the conduct pleasing to God. He sent messengers all over to announce, \"Ye who desire to know the ways of God and righteous conduct, come ye to Enoch!\" Thereupon a vast concourse of people thronged about him, to hear the wisdom he would teach and learn from his mouth what is good and right. Even kings and princes, no less than one hundred and thirty in number, assembled about him, and submitted themselves to his dominion, to be taught and guided by him, as he taught and guided all the others. Peace reigned thus over the whole world all the two hundred and forty-three years during which the influence of Enoch prevailed. At the expiration of this period, in the year in which Adam died, and was buried with great honors by Seth, Enosh, Enoch, and Methuselah, Enoch resolved to retire again from intercourse with men, and devote himself wholly to the service of God. But he withdrew gradually. First he would spend three days in prayer and praise of God, and on the fourth day he would return to his disciples and grant them instruction. Many years passed thus, then he appeared among them but once a week, later, once a month, and, finally, once a year. The kings, princes, and all others who were desirous of seeing Enoch and hearkening to his words did not venture to come close to him during the times of his retirement. Such awful majesty sat upon his countenance, they feared for their very life if they but looked at him. They therefore resolved that all men should prefer their requests before Enoch on the day he showed himself unto them. The impression made by the teachings of Enoch upon all who heard them was powerful. They prostrated themselves before him, and cried \"Long live the king! Long live the king!\" On a certain day, while Enoch was giving audience to his followers, an angel appeared and made known unto him that God had resolved to install him as king over the angels in heaven, as until then he had reigned over men. He called together all the inhabitants of the earth, and addressed them thus: \"I have been summoned to ascend into heaven, and I know not on what day I shall go thither. Therefore I will teach you wisdom and righteousness before I go hence.\" A few days yet Enoch spent among men, and all the time left to him he gave instruction in wisdom, knowledge, God-fearing conduct, and piety, and established law and order, for the regulation of the affairs of men. Then those gathered near him saw a gigantic steed descend from the skies, and they told Enoch of it, who said, \"The steed is for me, for the time has come and the day when I leave you, never to be seen again.\" So it was. The steed approached Enoch, and he mounted upon its back, all the time instructing the people, exhorting them, enjoining them to serve God and walk in His ways. Eight hundred thousand of the people followed a day's journey after him. But on the second day Enoch urged his retinue to turn back: \"Go ye home, lest death overtake you, if you follow me farther.\" Most of them heeded his words and went back, but a number remained with him for six days, though he admonished them daily to return and not bring death down upon themselves. On the sixth day of the journey, he said to those still accompanying him, \"Go ye home, for on the morrow I shall ascend to heaven, and whoever will then be near me, he will die.\" Nevertheless, some of his companions remained with him, saying: \"Whithersoever thou goest, we will go. By the living God, death alone shall part us.\" On the seventh day Enoch was carried into the heavens in a fiery chariot drawn by fiery chargers. The day thereafter, the kings who had turned back in good time sent messengers to inquire into the fate of the men who had refused to separate themselves from Enoch, for they had noted the number of them. They found snow and great hailstones upon the spot whence Enoch had risen, and, when they searched beneath, they discovered the bodies of all who had remained behind with Enoch. He alone was not among them; he was on high in heaven.",

      "content": "This was not the first time Enoch had been in heaven. Once before, while he sojourned among men, he had been permitted to see all there is on earth and in the heavens. On a time when he was sleeping, a great grief came upon his heart, and he wept in his dream, not knowing what the grief meant, nor what would happen to him. And there appeared to him two men, very tall. Their faces shone like the sun, and their eyes were like burning lamps, and fire came forth from their lips; their wings were brighter than gold, their hands whiter than snow. They stood at the head of Enoch's bed, and called him by his name. He awoke from his sleep, and hastened and made obeisance to them, and was terrified. And these men said to him: \"Be of good cheer, Enoch, be not afraid; the everlasting God hath sent us to thee, and lo! to-day thou shalt ascend with us into heaven. And tell thy sons and thy servants, and let none seek thee, till the Lord bring thee back to them.\" Enoch did as he was told, and after he had spoken to his sons, and instructed them not to turn aside from God, and to keep His judgment, these two men summoned him, and took him on their wings, and placed him on the clouds, which moved higher and higher, till they set him down in the first heaven. Here they showed him the two hundred angels who rule the stars, and their heavenly service. Here he saw also the treasuries of snow and ice, of clouds and dew. From there they took him to the second heaven, where he saw the fallen angels imprisoned, they who obeyed not the commandments of God, and took counsel of their own will. The fallen angels said to Enoch, \"O man of God! Pray for us to the Lord,\" and he answered: \"Who am I, a mortal man, that I should pray for angels? Who knows whither I go, or what awaits me?\" They took him from thence to the third heaven, where they showed him Paradise, with all the trees of beautiful colors, and their fruits, ripe and luscious, and all kinds of food which they produced, springing up with delightful fragrance. In the midst of Paradise he saw the tree of life, in that place in which God rests when He comes into Paradise. This tree cannot be described for its excellence and sweet fragrance, and it is beautiful, more than any created thing, and on all its sides it is like gold and crimson in appearance, and transparent as fire, and it covers everything. From its root in the garden there go forth four streams, which pour out honey, milk, oil, and wine, and they go down to the Paradise of Eden, that lies on the confines between the earthly region of corruptibility and the heavenly region of incorruptibility, and thence they go along the earth. He also saw the three hundred angels who keep the garden, and with never-ceasing voices and blessed singing they serve the Lord every day. The angels leading Enoch explained to him that this place is prepared for the righteous, while the terrible place prepared for the sinners is in the northern regions of the third heaven. He saw there all sorts of tortures, and impenetrable gloom, and there is no light there, but a gloomy fire is always burning. And all that place has fire on all sides, and on all sides cold and ice, thus it burns and freezes. And the angels, terrible and without pity, carry savage weapons, and their torture is unmerciful. The angels took him then to the fourth heaven, and showed him all the comings in and goings forth, and all the rays of the light of the sun and the moon. He saw the fifteen myriads of angels who go out with the sun, and attend him during the day, and the thousand angels who attend him by night. Each angel has six wings, and they go before the chariot of the sun, while one hundred angels keep the sun warm, and light it up. He saw also the wonderful and strange creatures named phoenixes and chalkidri, who attend the chariot of the sun, and go with him, bringing heat and dew. They showed him also the six gates in the east of the fourth heaven, by which the sun goes forth, and the six gates in the west where he sets, and also the gates by which the moon goes out, and those by which she enters. In the middle of the fourth heaven he saw an armed host, serving the Lord with cymbals and organs and unceasing voices. In the fifth heaven he saw many hosts of the angels called Grigori. Their appearance was like men, and their size was greater than the size of the giants, their countenances were withered, and their lips silent. On his question who they were, the angels leading him answered, \"These are the Grigori, who with their prince Salamiel rejected the holy Lord.\" Enoch then said to the Grigori, \"Why wait ye, brethren, and serve ye not before the face of the Lord, and why perform ye not your duties before the face of the Lord, and anger not your Lord to the end?\" The Grigori listened to the rebuke, and when the trumpets resounded together with a loud call, they also began to sing with one voice, and their voices went forth before the Lord with sadness and tenderness. In the seventh heaven he saw the seven bands of archangels who arrange and study the revolutions of the stars and the changes of the moon and the revolution of the sun, and superintend the good or evil conditions of the world. And they arrange teachings and instructions and sweet speaking and singing and all kinds of glorious praise. They hold in subjection all living things, both in heaven and on earth. In the midst of them are seven phoenixes, and seven cherubim, and seven six-winged creatures, singing with one voice. When Enoch reached the seventh heaven, and saw all the fiery hosts of great archangels and incorporeal powers and lordships and principalities and powers, he was afraid and trembled with a great terror. Those leading him took hold of him, and brought him into the midst of them, and said to him, \"Be of good cheer, Enoch, be not afraid,\" and they showed him the Lord from afar, sitting on His lofty throne, while all the heavenly hosts, divided in ten classes, having approached, stood on the ten steps according to their rank, and made obeisance to the Lord. And so they proceeded to their places in joy and mirth and boundless light, singing songs with low and gentle voices, and gloriously serving Him. They leave not nor depart day or night, standing before the face of the Lord, working His will, cherubim and seraphim, standing around His throne. And the six-winged creatures overshadow all His throne, singing with a soft voice before the face of the Lord, \"Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts; heaven and earth are full of His glory.\" When he had seen all these, the angels leading him said to him, \"Enoch, up to this time we were ordered to accompany thee.\" They departed, and he saw them no more. Enoch remained at the extremity of the seventh heaven, in great terror, saying to himself, \"Woe is me! What has come upon me!\" But then Gabriel came and said unto him, \"Enoch, be not afraid, stand up and come with me, and stand up before the face of the Lord forever.\" And Enoch answered: \"O my lord, my spirit has departed from me with fear and trembling. Call the men to me who have brought me to the place! Upon them I have relied, and with them I would go before the face of the Lord.\" And Gabriel hurried him away like a leaf carried off by the wind, and set him before the face of the Lord. Enoch fell down and worshipped the Lord, who said to him: \"Enoch, be not afraid! Rise up and stand before My face forever.\" And Michael lifted him up, and at the command of the Lord took his earthly robe from him, and anointed him with the holy oil, and clothed him, and when he gazed upon himself, he looked like one of God's glorious ones, and fear and trembling departed from him. God called then one of His archangels who was more wise than all the others, and wrote down all the doings of the Lord, and He said to him, \"Bring forth the books from My store-place, and give a reed to Enoch, and interpret the books to him.\" The angel did as he was commanded, and he instructed Enoch thirty days and thirty nights, and his lips never ceased speaking, while Enoch was writing down all the things about heaven and earth, angels and men, and all that is suitable to be instructed in. He also wrote down all about the souls of men, those of them which are not born, and the places prepared for them forever. He copied all accurately, and he wrote three hundred and sixty-six books. After he had received all the instructions from the archangel, God revealed unto him great secrets, which even the angels do not know. He told him how, out of the lowest darkness, the visible and the invisible were created, how He formed heaven, light, water, and earth, and also the fall of Satan and the creation and sin of Adam He narrated to him, and further revealed to him that the duration of the world will be seven thousand years, and the eighth millennium will be a time when there is no computation, no end, neither years, nor months, nor weeks, nor days, nor hours. The Lord finished this revelation to Enoch with the words: \"And now I give thee Samuil and Raguil, who brought thee to Me. Go with them upon the earth, and tell thy sons what things I have said to thee, and what thou hast seen from the lowest heaven up to My throne. Give them the works written out by thee, and they shall read them, and shall distribute the books to their children's children and from generation to generation and from nation to nation. And I will give thee My messenger Michael for thy writings and for the writings of thy fathers, Adam, Seth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel, and Jared thy father. And I shall not require them till the last age, for I have instructed My two angels, Ariuk and Mariuk, whom I have put upon the earth as their guardians, and I have ordered them in time to guard them, that the account of what I shall do in thy family may not be lost in the deluge to come. For on account of the wickedness and iniquity of men, I will bring a deluge upon the earth, and I will destroy all, but I will leave a righteous man of thy race with all his house, who shall act according to My will. From their seed will be raised up a numerous generation, and on the extinction of that family, I will show them the books of thy writings and of thy father, and the guardians of them on earth will show them to the men who are true and please Me. And they shall tell to another generation, and they, having read them, shall be glorified at last more than before.\" Enoch was then sent to earth to remain there for thirty days to instruct his sons, but before he left heaven, God sent an angel to him whose appearance was like snow, and his hands were like ice. Enoch looked at him, and his face was chilled, that men might be able to endure the sight of him. The angels who took him to heaven put him upon his bed, in the place where his son Methuselah was expecting him by day and by night. Enoch assembled his sons and all his household, and instructed them faithfully about all things he had seen, heard, and written down, and he gave his books to his sons, to keep them and read them, admonishing them not to conceal the books, but tell them to all desiring to know. When the thirty days had been completed, the Lord sent darkness upon the earth, and there was gloom, and it hid the men standing with Enoch. And the angels hasted and took Enoch, and carried him to the highest heaven, where the Lord received him and set him before His face, and the darkness departed from the earth, and there was light. And the people saw, and did not understand how Enoch was taken, and they glorified God. Enoch was born on the sixth day of the month of Siwan, and he was taken to heaven in the same month, Siwan, on the same day and in the same hour when he was born. And Methuselah hasted and all his brethren, the sons of Enoch, and built an altar in the place called Achuzan, whence Enoch was taken up to heaven. The elders and all the people came to the festivity and brought their gifts to the sons of Enoch, and made a great festivity, rejoicing and being merry for three days, praising God, who had given such a sign by means of Enoch, who had found favor with them.",

      "content": "The sinfulness of men was the reason why Enoch was translated to heaven. Thus Enoch himself told Rabbi Ishmael. When the generation of the deluge transgressed, and spoke to God, saying, \"Depart from us, for we do not desire to know Thy ways,\" Enoch was carried to heaven, to serve there as a witness that God was not a cruel God in spite of the destruction decreed upon all living beings on earth. When Enoch, under the guidance of the angel 'Anpiel, was carried from earth to heaven, the holy beings, the ofanim, the seraphim, the cherubim, all those who move the throne of God, and the ministering spirits whose substance is of consuming fire, they all, at a distance of six hundred and fifty million and three hundred parasangs, noticed the presence of a human being, and they exclaimed: \"Whence the odor of one born of woman? How comes he into the highest heaven of the fire-coruscating angels?\" But God replied: \"O My servants and hosts, ye, My cherubim, ofanim, and seraphim, let this not be an offense unto you, for all the children of men denied Me and My mighty dominion, and they paid homage to the idols, so that I transferred the Shekinah from earth to heaven. But this man Enoch is the elect of men. He has more faith, justice, and righteousness than all the rest, and he is the only reward I have derived from the terrestrial world.\" Before Enoch could be admitted to service near the Divine throne, the gates of wisdom were opened unto him, and the gates of understanding, and of discernment, of life, peace, and the Shekinah, of strength and power, of might, loveliness, and grace, of humility and fear of sin. Equipped by God with extraordinary wisdom, sagacity, judgment, knowledge, learning, compassionateness, love, kindness, grace, humility, strength, power, might, splendor, beauty, shapeliness, and all other excellent qualities, beyond the endowment of any of the celestial beings, Enoch received, besides, many thousand blessings from God, and his height and his breadth became equal to the height and the breadth of the world, and thirty-six wings were attached to his body, to the right and to the left, each as large as the world, and three hundred and sixty-five thousand eyes were bestowed upon him, each brilliant as the sun. A magnificent throne was erected for him beside the gates of the seventh celestial palace, and a herald proclaimed throughout the heavens concerning him, who was henceforth to be called Metatron in the celestial regions: \"I have appointed My servant Metatron as prince and chief over all the princes in My realm, with the exception only of the eight august and exalted princes that bear My name. Whatever angel has a request to prefer to Me, shall appear before Metatron, and what he will command at My bidding, ye must observe and do, for the prince of wisdom and the prince of understanding are at his service, and they will reveal unto him the sciences of the celestials and the terrestrials, the knowledge of the present order of the world and the knowledge of the future order of the world. Furthermore, I have made him the guardian of the treasures of the palaces in the heaven 'Arabot, and of the treasures of life that are in the highest heaven.\" Out of the love He bore Enoch, God arrayed him in a magnificent garment, to which every kind of luminary in existence was attached, and a crown gleaming with forty-nine jewels, the splendor of which pierced to all parts of the seven heavens and to the four corners of the earth. In the presence of the heavenly family, He set this crown upon the head of Enoch, and called him \"the little Lord.\" It bears also the letters by means of which heaven and earth were created, and seas and rivers, mountains and valleys, planets and constellations, lightning and thunder, snow and hail, storm and whirlwind—these and also all things needed in the world, and the mysteries of creation. Even the princes of the heavens, when they see Metatron, tremble before him, and prostrate themselves; his magnificence and majesty, the splendor and beauty radiating from him overwhelm them, even the wicked Samael, the greatest of them, even Gabriel the angel of the fire, Bardiel the angel of the hail, Ruhiel the angel of the wind, Barkiel the angel of the lightning, Za'miel the angel of the hurricane, Zakkiel the angel of the storm, Sui'el the angel of the earthquake, Za'fiel the angel of the showers, Ra'miel the angel of the thunder, Ra'shiel the angel of the whirlwind, Shalgiel the angel of the snow, Matriel the angel of the rain, Shamshiel the angel of the day, Leliel the angel of the night, Galgliel the angel of the solar system, Ofaniel the angel of the wheel of the moon, Kokabiel the angel of the stars, and Rahtiel the angel of the constellations. When Enoch was transformed into Metatron, his body was turned into celestial fire—his flesh became flame, his veins fire, his bones glimmering coals, the light of his eyes heavenly brightness, his eyeballs torches of fire, his hair a flaring blaze, all his limbs and organs burning sparks, and his frame a consuming fire. To right of him sparkled flames of fire, to left of him burnt torches of fire, and on all sides he was engirdled by storm and whirlwind, hurricane and thundering.",

He walked in the footsteps of his father, teaching truth, knowledge, and fear of God to the children of men all his life, and deviating from the path of rectitude neither to the right nor the left. He delivered the world from thousands of demons, the posterity of Adam which he had begotten with Lilith, that she-devil of she-devils. These demons and evil spirits, as often as they encountered a man, had sought to injure and even slay him, until Methuselah appeared, and supplicated the mercy of God. He spent three days in fasting, and then God gave him permission to write the Ineffable Name upon his sword, wherewith he slew ninety-four myriads of the demons in a minute, until Agrimus, the first-born of them, came to him and entreated him to desist, at the same time handing the names of the demons and imps over to him. And so Methuselah placed their kings in iron fetters, while the remainder fled away and hid themselves in the innermost chambers and recesses of the ocean. And it is on account of the wonderful sword by means of which the demons were killed that he was called Methuselah. He was so pious a man that he composed two hundred and thirty parables in praise of God for every word he uttered. When he died, the people heard a great commotion in the heavens, and they saw nine hundred rows of mourners corresponding to the nine hundred orders of the Mishnah which he had studied, and tears flowed from the eyes of the holy beings down upon the spot where he died. Seeing the grief of the celestials, the people on earth also mourned over the demise of Methuselah, and God rewarded them therefor. He added seven days to the time of grace which He had ordained before bringing destruction upon the earth by a flood of waters.",

      "content": "Methuselah took a wife for his son Lamech, and she bore him a man child. The body of the babe was white as snow and red as a blooming rose, and the hair of his head and his long locks were white as wool, and his eyes like the rays of the sun. When he opened his eyes, he lighted up the whole house, like the sun, and the whole house was very full of light. And when he was taken from the hand of the midwife, he opened his mouth and praised the Lord of righteousness. His father Lamech was afraid of him, and fled, and came to his own father Methuselah. And he said to him: \"I have begotten a strange son; he is not like a human being, but resembles the children of the angels of heaven, and his nature is different, and he is not like us, and his eyes are as the rays of the sun, and his countenance is glorious. And it seems to me that he is not sprung from me, but from the angels, and I fear that in his days a wonder may be wrought on the earth. And now, my father, I am here to petition thee and implore thee, that thou mayest go to Enoch, our father, and learn from him the truth, for his dwelling place is among the angels.\" And when Methuselah heard the words of his son, he went to Enoch, to the ends of the earth, and he cried aloud, and Enoch heard his voice, and appeared before him, and asked him the reason of his coming. Methuselah told him the cause of his anxiety, and requested him to make the truth known to him. Enoch answered, and said: \"The Lord will do a new thing in the earth. There will come a great destruction on the earth, and a deluge for one year. This son who is born unto thee will be left on the earth, and his three children will be saved with him, when all mankind that are on the earth shall die. And there will be a great punishment on the earth, and the earth will be cleansed from all impurity. And now make known to thy son Lamech that he who was born is in truth his son, and call his name Noah, for he will be left to you, and he and his children will be saved from the destruction which will come upon the earth.\" When Methuselah had heard the words of his father, who showed him all the secret things, he returned home, and he called the child Noah, for he would cause the earth to rejoice in compensation for all destruction. By the name Noah he was called only by his grandfather Methuselah; his father and all others called him Menahem. His generation was addicted to sorcery, and Methuselah apprehended that his grandson might be bewitched if his true name were known, wherefore he kept it a secret. Menahem, Comforter, suited him as well as Noah; it indicated that he would be a consoler, if but the evil-doers of his time would repent of their misdeeds. At his very birth it was felt that he would bring consolation and deliverance. When the Lord said to Adam, \"Cursed is the ground for thy sake,\" he asked, \"For how long a time?\" and the answer made by God was, \"Until a man child shall be born whose conformation is such that the rite of circumcision need not be practiced upon him.\" This was fulfilled in Noah, he was circumcised from his mother's womb. Noah had scarcely come into the world when a marked change was noticeable. Since the curse brought upon the earth by the sin of Adam, it happened that wheat being sown, yet oats would sprout and grow. This ceased with the appearance of Noah: the earth bore the products planted in it. And it was Noah who, when he was grown to manhood, invented the plough, the scythe, the hoe, and other implements for cultivating the ground. Before him men had worked the land with their bare hands. There was another token to indicate that the child born unto Lamech was appointed for an extraordinary destiny. When God created Adam, He gave him dominion over all things: the cow obeyed the ploughman, and the furrow was willing to be drawn. But after the fall of Adam all things rebelled against him: the cow refused obedience to the ploughman, and also the furrow was refractory. Noah was born, and all returned to its state preceding the fall of man. Before the birth of Noah, the sea was in the habit of transgressing its bounds twice daily, morning and evening, and flooding the land up to the graves. After his birth it kept within its confines. And the famine that afflicted the world in the time of Lamech, the second of the ten great famines appointed to come upon it, ceased its ravages with the birth of Noah.",

      "content": "Grown to manhood, Noah followed in the ways of his grandfather Methuselah, while all other men of the time rose up against this pious king. So far from observing his precepts, they pursued the evil inclination of their hearts, and perpetrated all sorts of abominable deeds. Chiefly the fallen angels and their giant posterity caused the depravity of mankind. The blood spilled by the giants cried unto heaven from the ground, and the four archangels accused the fallen angels and their sons before God, whereupon He gave the following orders to them: Uriel was sent to Noah to announce to him that the earth would be destroyed by a flood, and to teach him how to save his own life. Raphael was told to put the fallen angel Azazel into chains, cast him into a pit of sharp and pointed stones in the desert Dudael, and cover him with darkness, and so was he to remain until the great day of judgment, when he would be thrown into the fiery pit of hell, and the earth would be healed of the corruption he had contrived upon it. Gabriel was charged to proceed against the bastards and the reprobates, the sons of the angels begotten with the daughters of men, and plunge them into deadly conflicts with one another. Shemhazai's ilk were handed over to Michael, who first caused them to witness the death of their children in their bloody combat with each other, and then he bound them and pinned them under the hills of the earth, where they will remain for seventy generations, until the day of judgment, to be carried thence to the fiery pit of hell. The fall of Azazel and Shemhazai came about in this way. When the generation of the deluge began to practice idolatry, God was deeply grieved. The two angels Shemhazai and Azazel arose, and said: \"O Lord of the world! It has happened, that which we foretold at the creation of the world and of man, saying, 'What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?'\" And God said, \"And what will become of the world now without man?\" Whereupon the angels: \"We will occupy ourselves with it.\" Then said God: \"I am well aware of it, and I know that if you inhabit the earth, the evil inclination will overpower you, and you will be more iniquitous than ever men.\" The angels pleaded, \"Grant us but permission to dwell among men, and Thou shalt see how we will sanctify Thy Name.\" God yielded to their wish, saying, \"Descend and sojourn among men!\" When the angels came to earth, and beheld the daughters of men in all their grace and beauty, they could not restrain their passion. Shemhazai saw a maiden named Istehar, and he lost his heart to her. She promised to surrender herself to him, if first he taught her the Ineffable Name, by means of which he raised himself to heaven. He assented to her condition. But once she knew it, she pronounced the Name, and herself ascended to heaven, without fulfilling her promise to the angel. God said, \"Because she kept herself aloof from sin, we will place her among the seven stars, that men may never forget her,\" and she was put in the constellation of the Pleiades. Shemhazai and Azazel, however, were not deterred from entering into alliances with the daughters of men, and to the first two sons were born. Azazel began to devise the finery and the ornaments by means of which women allure men. Thereupon God sent Metatron to tell Shemhazai that He had resolved to destroy the world and bring on a deluge. The fallen angel began to weep and grieve over the fate of the world and the fate of his two sons. If the world went under, what would they have to eat, they who needed daily a thousand camels, a thousand horses, and a thousand steers? These two sons of Shemhazai, Hiwwa and Hiyya by name, dreamed dreams. The one saw a great stone which covered the earth, and the earth was marked all over with lines upon lines of writing. An angel came, and with a knife obliterated all the lines, leaving but four letters upon the stone. The other son saw a large pleasure grove planted with all sorts of trees. But angels approached bearing axes, and they felled the trees, sparing a single one with three of its branches. When Hiwwa and Hiyya awoke, they repaired to their father, who interpreted the dreams for them, saying, \"God will bring a deluge, and none will escape with his life, excepting only Noah and his sons.\" When they heard this, the two began to cry and scream, but their father consoled them: \"Soft, soft! Do not grieve. As often as men cut or haul stones, or launch vessels, they shall invoke your names, Hiwwa! Hiyya!\" This prophecy soothed them. Shemhazai then did penance. He suspended himself between heaven and earth, and in this position of a penitent sinner he hangs to this day. But Azazel persisted obdurately in his sin of leading mankind astray by means of sensual allurements. For this reason two he-goats were sacrificed in the Temple on the Day of Atonement, the one for God, that He pardon the sins of Israel, the other for Azazel, that he bear the sins of Israel. Unlike Istehar, the pious maiden, Naamah, the lovely sister of Tubal-cain, led the angels astray with her beauty, and from her union with Shamdon sprang the devil Asmodeus. She was as shameless as all the other descendants of Cain, and as prone to bestial indulgences. Cainite women and Cainite men alike were in the habit of walking abroad naked, and they gave themselves up to every conceivable manner of lewd practices. Of such were the women whose beauty and sensual charms tempted the angels from the path of virtue. The angels, on the other hand, no sooner had they rebelled against God and descended to earth than they lost their transcendental qualities, and were invested with sublunary bodies, so that a union with the daughters of men became possible. The offspring of these alliances between the angels and the Cainite women were the giants, known for their strength and their sinfulness; as their very name, the Emim, indicates, they inspired fear. They have many other names. Sometimes they go by the name Rephaim, because one glance at them made one's heart grow weak; or by the name Gibborim, simply giants, because their size was so enormous that their thigh measured eighteen ells; or by the name Zamzummim, because they were great masters in war; or by the name Anakim, because they touched the sun with their neck; or by the name Ivvim, because, like the snake, they could judge of the qualities of the soil; or finally, by the name Nephilim, because, bringing the world to its fall, they themselves fell.",

      "content": "While the descendants of Cain resembled their father in his sinfulness and depravity, the descendants of Seth led a pious, well-regulated life, and the difference between the conduct of the two stocks was reflected in their habitations. The family of Seth was settled upon the mountains in the vicinity of Paradise, while the family of Cain resided in the field of Damascus, the spot whereon Abel was slain by Cain. Unfortunately, at the time of Methuselah, following the death of Adam, the family of Seth became corrupted after the manner of the Cainites. The two strains united with each other to execute all kinds of iniquitous deeds. The result of the marriages between them were the Nephilim, whose sins brought the deluge upon the world. In their arrogance they claimed the same pedigree as the posterity of Seth, and they compared themselves with princes and men of noble descent. The wantonness of this generation was in a measure due to the ideal conditions under which mankind lived before the flood. They knew neither toil nor care, and as a consequence of their extraordinary prosperity they grew insolent. In their arrogance they rose up against God. A single sowing bore a harvest sufficient for the needs of forty years, and by means of magic arts they could compel the very sun and moon to stand ready to do their service. The raising of children gave them no trouble. They were born after a few days' pregnancy, and immediately after birth they could walk and talk; they themselves aided the mother in severing the navel string. Not even demons could do them harm. Once a new-born babe, running to fetch a light whereby his mother might cut the navel string, met the chief of the demons, and a combat ensued between the two. Suddenly the crowing of a cock was heard, and the demon made off, crying out to the child, \"Go and report unto thy mother, if it had not been for the crowing of the cock, I had killed thee!\" Whereupon the child retorted, \"Go and report unto thy mother, if it had not been for my uncut navel string, I had killed thee!\" It was their care-free life that gave them space and leisure for their infamies. For a time God, in His long-suffering kindness, passed by the iniquities of men, but His forbearance ceased when once they began to lead unchaste lives, for \"God is patient with all sins save only an immoral life.\" The other sin that hastened the end of the iniquitous generation was their rapacity. So cunningly were their depredations planned that the law could not touch them. If a countryman brought a basket of vegetables to market, they would edge up to it, one after the other, and abstract a bit, each in itself of petty value, but in a little while the dealer would have none left to sell. Even after God had resolved upon the destruction of the sinners, He still permitted His mercy to prevail, in that He sent Noah unto them, who exhorted them for one hundred and twenty years to amend their ways, always holding the flood over them as a threat. As for them, they but derided him. When they saw him occupying himself with the building of the ark, they asked, \"Wherefore this ark?\" Noah: \"God will bring a flood upon you.\" The sinners: \"What sort of flood? If He sends a fire flood, against that we know how to protect ourselves. If it is a flood of waters, then, if the waters bubble up from the earth, we will cover them with iron rods, and if they descend from above, we know a remedy against that, too.\" Noah: \"The waters will ooze out from under your feet, and you will not be able to ward them off.\" Partly they persisted in their obduracy of heart because Noah had made known to them that the flood would not descend so long as the pious Methuselah sojourned among them. The period of one hundred and twenty years which God had appointed as the term of their probation having expired, Methuselah died, but out of regard for the memory of this pious man God gave them another week's respite, the week of mourning for him. During this time of grace, the laws of nature were suspended, the sun rose in the west and set in the east. To the sinners God gave the dainties that await man in the future world, for the purpose of showing them what they were forfeiting. But all this proved unavailing, and, Methuselah and the other pious men of the generation having departed this life, God brought the deluge upon the earth.",

      "content": "Great wisdom was needed for building the ark, which was to have space for all beings on earth, even the spirits. Only the fishes did not have to be provided for. Noah acquired the necessary wisdom from the book given to Adam by the angel Raziel, in which all celestial and all earthly knowledge is recorded. While the first human pair were still in Paradise, it once happened that Samael, accompanied by a lad, approached Eve and requested her to keep a watchful eye upon his little son until he should return. Eve gave him the promise. When Adam came back from a walk in Paradise, he found a howling, screaming child with Eve, who, in reply to his question, told him it was Samael's. Adam was annoyed, and his annoyance grew as the boy cried and screamed more and more violently. In his vexation he dealt the little one a blow that killed him. But the corpse did not cease to wail and weep, nor did it cease when Adam cut it up into bits. To rid himself of the plague, Adam cooked the remains, and he and Eve ate them. Scarcely had they finished, when Samael appeared and demanded his son. The two malefactors tried to deny everything; they pretended they had no knowledge of his son. But Samael said to them: \"What! You dare tell lies, and God in times to come will give Israel the Torah in which it is said, 'Keep thee far from a false word'?\" While they were speaking thus, suddenly the voice of the slain lad was heard proceeding from the heart of Adam and Eve, and it addressed these words to Samael: \"Go hence! I have penetrated to the heart of Adam and the heart of Eve, and never again shall I quit their hearts, nor the hearts of their children, or their children's children, unto the end of all generations.\" Samael departed, but Adam was sore grieved, and he put on sackcloth and ashes, and he fasted many, many days, until God appeared unto him, and said: \"My son, have no fear of Samael. I will give thee a remedy that will help thee against him, for it was at My instance that he went to thee.\" Adam asked, \"And what is this remedy?\" God: \"The Torah.\" Adam: \"And where is the Torah?\" God then gave him the book of the angel Raziel, which he studied day and night. After some time had passed, the angels visited Adam, and, envious of the wisdom he had drawn from the book, they sought to destroy him cunningly by calling him a god and prostrating themselves before him, in spite of his remonstrance, \"Do not prostrate yourselves before me, but magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His Name together.\" However, the envy of the angels was so great that they stole the book God had given Adam from him, and threw it in the sea. Adam searched for it everywhere in vain, and the loss distressed him sorely. Again he fasted many days, until God appeared unto him, and said: \"Fear not! I will give the book back to thee,\" and He called Rahab, the Angel of the Sea, and ordered him to recover the book from the sea and restore it to Adam. And so he did. Upon the death of Adam, the holy book disappeared, but later the cave in which it was hidden was revealed to Enoch in a dream. It was from this book that Enoch drew his knowledge of nature, of the earth and of the heavens, and he became so wise through it that his wisdom exceeded the wisdom of Adam. Once he had committed it to memory, Enoch hid the book again. Now, when God resolved upon bringing the flood on the earth, He sent the archangel Raphael to Noah, as the bearer of the following message: \"I give thee herewith the holy book, that all the secrets and mysteries written therein may be made manifest unto thee, and that thou mayest know how to fulfil its injunction in holiness, purity, modesty, and humbleness. Thou wilt learn from it how to build an ark of the wood of the gopher tree, wherein thou, and thy sons, and thy wife shall find protection.\" Noah took the book, and when he studied it, the holy spirit came upon him, and he knew all things needful for the building of the ark and the gathering together of the animals. The book, which was made of sapphires, he took with him into the ark, having first enclosed it in a golden casket. All the time he spent in the ark it served him as a time-piece, to distinguish night from day. Before his death, he entrusted it to Shem, and he in turn to Abraham. From Abraham it descended through Jacob, Levi, Moses, and Joshua to Solomon, who learnt all his wisdom from it, and his skill in the healing art, and also his mastery over the demons.",

      "content": "The ark was completed according to the instructions laid down in the Book of Raziel. Noah's next task was gathering in the animals. No less than thirty-two species of birds and three hundred and sixty-five of reptiles he had to take along with him. But God ordered the animals to repair to the ark, and they trooped thither, and Noah did not have to do so much as stretch out a finger. Indeed, more appeared than were required to come, and God instructed him to sit at the door of the ark and note which of the animals lay down as they reached the entrance and which stood. The former belonged in the ark, but not the latter. Taking up his post as he had been commanded, Noah observed a lioness with her two cubs. All three beasts crouched. But the two young ones began to struggle with the mother, and she arose and stood up next to them. Then Noah led the two cubs into the ark. The wild beasts, and the cattle, and the birds which were not accepted remained standing about the ark all of seven days, for the assembling of the animals happened one week before the flood began to descend. On the day whereon they came to the ark, the sun was darkened, and the foundations of the earth trembled, and lightning flashed, and the thunder boomed, as never before. And yet the sinners remained impenitent. In naught did they change their wicked doings during those last seven days. When finally the flood broke loose, seven hundred thousand of the children of men gathered around the ark, and implored Noah to grant them protection. With a loud voice he replied, and said: \"Are ye not those who were rebellious toward God, saying, 'There is no God'? Therefore He has brought ruin upon you, to annihilate you and destroy you from the face of the earth. Have I not been prophesying this unto you these hundred and twenty years, and you would not give heed unto the voice of God? Yet now you desire to be kept alive!\" Then the sinners cried out: \"So be it! We all are ready now to turn back to God, if only thou wilt open the door of thy ark to receive us, that we may live and not die.\" Noah made answer, and said: \"That ye do now, when your need presses hard upon you. Why did you not turn to God during all the hundred and twenty years which the Lord appointed unto you as the term of repentance? Now do ye come, and ye speak thus, because distress besets your lives. Therefore God will not hearken unto you and give you ear; naught will you accomplish!\" The crowd of sinners tried to take the entrance to the ark by storm, but the wild beasts keeping watch around the ark set upon them, and many were slain, while the rest escaped, only to meet death in the waters of the flood. The water alone could not have made an end of them, for they were giants in stature and strength. When Noah threatened them with the scourge of God, they would make reply: \"If the waters of the flood come from above, they will never reach up to our necks; and if they come from below, the soles of our feet are large enough to dam up the springs.\" But God bade each drop pass through Gehenna before it fell to earth, and the hot rain scalded the skin of the sinners. The punishment that overtook them was befitting their crime. As their sensual desires had made them hot, and inflamed them to immoral excesses, so they were chastised by means of heated water. Not even in the hour of the death struggle could the sinners suppress their vile instincts. When the water began to stream up out of the springs, they threw their little children into them, to choke the flood. It was by the grace of God, not on account of his merits, that Noah found shelter in the ark before the overwhelming force of the waters. Although he was better than his contemporaries, he was yet not worthy of having wonders done for his sake. He had so little faith that he did not enter the ark until the waters had risen to his knees. With him his pious wife Naamah, the daughter of Enosh, escaped the peril, and his three sons, and the wives of his three sons. Noah had not married until he was four hundred and ninety-eight years old. Then the Lord had bidden him to take a wife unto himself. He had not desired to bring children into the world, seeing that they would all have to perish in the flood, and he had only three sons, born unto him shortly before the deluge came. God had given him so small a number of offspring that he might be spared the necessity of building the ark on an overlarge scale in case they turned out to be pious. And if not, if they, too, were depraved like the rest of their generation, sorrow over their destruction would but be increased in proportion to their number. As Noah and his family were the only ones not to have a share in the corruptness of the age, so the animals received into the ark were such as had led a natural life. For the animals of the time were as immoral as the men: the dog united with the wolf, the cock with the pea-fowl, and many others paid no heed to sexual purity. Those that were saved were such as had kept themselves untainted. Before the flood the number of unclean animals had been greater than the number of the clean. Afterward the ratio was reversed, because while seven pairs of clean animals were preserved in the ark, but two pairs of the unclean were preserved. One animal, the reem, Noah could not take into the ark. On account of its huge size it could not find room therein. Noah therefore tied it to the ark, and it ran on behind. Also, he could not make space for the giant Og, the king of Bashan. He sat on top of the ark securely, and in this way escaped the flood of waters. Noah doled out his food to him daily, through a hole, because Og had promised that he and his descendants would serve him as slaves in perpetuity. Two creatures of a most peculiar kind also found refuge in the ark. Among the beings that came to Noah there was Falsehood asking for shelter. He was denied admission, because he had no companion, and Noah was taking in the animals only by pairs. Falsehood went off to seek a partner, and he met Misfortune, whom he associated with himself on the condition that she might appropriate what Falsehood earned. The pair were then accepted in the ark. When they left it, Falsehood noticed that whatever he gathered together disappeared at once, and he betook himself to his companion to seek an explanation, which she gave him in the following words, \"Did we not agree to the condition that I might take what you earn?\" and Falsehood had to depart empty-handed.",

      "content": "The assembling of the animals in the ark was but the smaller part of the task imposed upon Noah. His chief difficulty was to provide food for a year and accommodations for them. Long afterward Shem, the son of Noah, related to Eliezer, the servant of Abraham, the tale of their experiences with the animals in the ark. This is what he said: \"We had sore troubles in the ark. The day animals had to be fed by day, and the night animals by night. My father knew not what food to give to the little zikta. Once he cut a pomegranate in half, and a worm dropped out of the fruit, and was devoured by the zikta. Thenceforth my father would knead bran, and let it stand until it bred worms, which were fed to the animal. The lion suffered with a fever all the time, and therefore he did not annoy the others, because he did not relish dry food. The animal urshana my father found sleeping in a corner of the vessel, and he asked him whether he needed nothing to eat. He answered, and said: 'I saw thou wast very busy, and I did not wish to add to thy cares.' Whereupon my father said, 'May it be the will of the Lord to keep thee alive forever,' and the blessing was realized.\" The difficulties were increased when the flood began to toss the ark from side to side. All inside of it were shaken up like lentils in a pot. The lions began to roar, the oxen lowed, the wolves howled, and all the animals gave vent to their agony, each through the sounds it had the power to utter. Also Noah and his sons, thinking that death was nigh, broke into tears. Noah prayed to God: \"O Lord, help us, for we are not able to bear the evil that encompasses us. The billows surge about us, the streams of destruction make us afraid, and death stares us in the face. O hear our prayer, deliver us, incline Thyself unto us, and be gracious unto us! Redeem us and save us!\" The flood was produced by a union of the male waters, which are above the firmament, and the female waters issuing from the earth. The upper waters rushed through the space left when God removed two stars out of the constellation Pleiades. Afterward, to put a stop to the flood, God had to transfer two stars from the constellation of the Bear to the constellation of the Pleiades. That is why the Bear runs after the Pleiades. She wants her two children back, but they will be restored to her only in the future world. There were other changes among the celestial spheres during the year of the flood. All the time it lasted, the sun and the moon shed no light, whence Noah was called by his name, \"the resting one,\" for in his life the sun and the moon rested. The ark was illuminated by a precious stone, the light of which was more brilliant by night than by day, so enabling Noah to distinguish between day and night. The duration of the flood was a whole year. It began on the seventeenth day of Heshwan, and the rain continued for forty days, until the twenty-seventh of Kislew. The punishment corresponded to the crime of the sinful generation. They had led immoral lives, and begotten bastard children, whose embryonic state lasts forty days. From the twenty seventh of Kislew until the first of Siwan, a period of one hundred and fifty days, the water stood at one and the same height, fifteen ells above the earth. During that time all the wicked were destroyed, each one receiving the punishment due to him. Cain was among those that perished, and thus the death of Abel was avenged. So powerful were the waters in working havoc that the corpse of Adam was not spared in its grave. On the first of Siwan the waters began to abate, a quarter of an ell a day, and at the end of sixty days, on the tenth day of Ab, the summits of the mountains showed themselves. But many days before, on the tenth of Tammuz, Noah had sent forth the raven, and a week later the dove, on the first of her three sallies, repeated at intervals of a week. It took from the first of Ab until the first of Tishri for the waters to subside wholly from the face of the earth. Even then the soil was so miry that the dwellers in the ark had to remain within until the twenty-seventh day of Heshwan, completing a full sun year, consisting of twelve moons and eleven days. Noah had experienced difficulty all along in ascertaining the state of the waters. When he desired to dispatch the raven, the bird said: \"The Lord, thy Master, hates me, and thou dost hate me, too. Thy Master hates me, for He bade thee take seven pairs of the clean animals into the ark, and but two pairs of the unclean animals, to which I belong. Thou hatest me, for thou dost not choose, as a messenger, a bird of one of the kinds of which there are seven pairs in the ark, but thou sendest me, and of my kind there is but one pair. Suppose, now, I should perish by reason of heat or cold, would not the world be the poorer by a whole species of animals? Or can it be that thou hast cast a lustful eye upon my mate, and desirest to rid thyself of me?\" Where unto Noah made answer, and said: \"Wretch! I must live apart from my own wife in the ark. How much less would such thoughts occur to my mind as thou imputest to me!\" The raven's errand had no success, for when he saw the body of a dead man, he set to work to devour it, and did not execute the orders given to him by Noah. Thereupon the dove was sent out. Toward evening she returned with an olive leaf in her bill, plucked upon the Mount of Olives at Jerusalem, for the Holy Land had not been ravaged by the deluge. As she plucked it, she said to God: \"O Lord of the world, let my food be as bitter as the olive, but do Thou give it to me from Thy hand, rather than it should be sweet, and I be delivered into the power of men.\"",

      "title": "Noah Leaves The Ark",
      "content": "Though the earth assumed its old form at the end of the year of punishment, Noah did not abandon the ark until he received the command of God to leave it. He said to himself, \"As I entered the ark at the bidding of God, so I will leave it only at His bidding.\" Yet, when God bade Noah go out of the ark, he refused, because he feared that after he had lived upon the dry land for some time, and begotten children, God would bring another flood. He therefore would not leave the ark until God swore He would never visit the earth with a flood again. When he stepped out from the ark into the open, he began to weep bitterly at sight of the enormous ravages wrought by the flood, and he said to God: \"O Lord of the world! Thou art called the Merciful, and Thou shouldst have had mercy upon Thy creatures.\" God answered, and said: \"O thou foolish shepherd, now thou speakest to Me. Thou didst not so when I addressed kind words to thee, saying: 'I saw thee as a righteous man and perfect in thy generation, and I will bring the flood upon the earth to destroy all flesh. Make an ark for thyself of gopher wood.' Thus spake I to thee, telling thee all these circumstances, that thou mightest entreat mercy for the earth. But thou, as soon as thou didst hear that thou wouldst be rescued in the ark, thou didst not concern thyself about the ruin that would strike the earth. Thou didst but build an ark for thyself, in which thou wast saved. Now that the earth is wasted, thou openest thy mouth to supplicate and pray.\" Noah realized that he had been guilty of folly. To propitiate God and acknowledge his sin, he brought a sacrifice. God accepted the offering with favor, whence he is called by his name Noah. The sacrifice was not offered by Noah with his own hands; the priestly services connected with it were performed by his son Shem. There was a reason for this. One day in the ark Noah forgot to give his ration to the lion, and the hungry beast struck him so violent a blow with his paw that he was lame forever after, and, having a bodily defect, he was not permitted to do the offices of a priest. The sacrifices consisted of an ox, a sheep, a goat, two turtle doves, and two young pigeons. Noah had chosen these kinds because he supposed they were appointed for sacrifices, seeing that God had commanded him to take seven pairs of them into the ark with him. The altar was erected in the same place on which Adam and Cain and Abel had brought their sacrifices, and on which later the altar was to be in the sanctuary at Jerusalem. After the sacrifice was completed, God blessed Noah and his sons. He made them to be rulers of the world as Adam had been, and He gave them a command, saying, \"Be fruitful and multiply upon the earth,\" for during their sojourn in the ark, the two sexes, of men and animals alike, had lived apart from each other, because while a public calamity rages continence is becoming even to those who are left unscathed. This law of conduct had been violated by none in the ark except by Ham, by the dog, and by the raven. They all received a punishment. Ham's was that his descendants were men of dark-hued skin. As a token that He would destroy the earth no more, God set His bow in the cloud. Even if men should be steeped in sin again, the bow proclaims to them that their sins will cause no harm to the world. Times came in the course of the ages when men were pious enough not to have to live in dread of punishment. In such times the bow was not visible. God accorded permission to Noah and his descendants to use the flesh of animals for food, which had been forbidden from the time of Adam until then. But they were to abstain from the use of blood. He ordained the seven Noachian laws, the observance of which is incumbent upon all men, not upon Israel alone. God enjoined particularly the command against the shedding of human blood. Whoso would shed man's blood, his blood would be shed. Even if human judges let the guilty man go free, his punishment would overtake him. He would die an unnatural death, such as he had inflicted upon his fellow-man. Yea, even beasts that slew men, even of them would the life of men be required.",

      "content": "Noah lost his epithet \"the pious\" when he began to occupy himself with the growing of the vine. He became a \"man of the ground,\" and this first attempt to produce wine at the same time produced the first to drink to excess, the first to utter curses upon his associates, and the first to introduce slavery. This is the way it all came about. Noah found the vine which Adam had taken with him from Paradise, when he was driven forth. He tasted the grapes upon it, and, finding them palatable, he resolved to plant the vine and tend it. On the selfsame day on which he planted it, it bore fruit, he put it in the wine-press, drew off the juice, drank it, became drunken, and was dishonored—all on one day. His assistant in the work of cultivating the vine was Satan, who had happened along at the very moment when he was engaged in planting the slip he had found. Satan asked him: \"What is it thou art planting here?\" Noah: \"A vineyard.\" Satan: \"And what may be the qualities of what it produces?\" Noah: \"The fruit it bears is sweet, be it dry or moist. It yields wine that rejoiceth the heart of man.\" Satan: \"Let us go into partnership in this business of planting a vineyard.\" Noah: \"Agreed!\" Satan thereupon slaughtered a lamb, and then, in succession, a lion, a pig, and a monkey. The blood of each as it was killed he made to flow under the vine. Thus he conveyed to Noah what the qualities of wine are: before man drinks of it, he is innocent as a lamb; if he drinks of it moderately, he feels as strong as a lion; if he drinks more of it than he can bear, he resembles the pig; and if he drinks to the point of intoxication, then he behaves like a monkey, he dances around, sings, talks obscenely, and knows not what he is doing. This deterred Noah no more than did the example of Adam, whose fall had also been due to wine, for the forbidden fruit had been the grape, with which he had made himself drunk. In his drunken condition Noah betook himself to the tent of his wife. His son Ham saw him there, and he told his brothers what he had noticed, and said: \"The first man had but two sons, and one slew the other; this man Noah has three sons, yet he desires to beget a fourth besides.\" Nor did Ham rest satisfied with these disrespectful words against his father. He added to this sin of irreverence the still greater outrage of attempting to perform an operation upon his father designed to prevent procreation. When Noah awoke from his wine and became sober, he pronounced a curse upon Ham in the person of his youngest son Canaan. To Ham himself he could do no harm, for God had conferred a blessing upon Noah and his three sons as they departed from the ark. Therefore he put the curse upon the last-born son of the son that had prevented him from begetting a younger son than the three he had. The descendants of Ham through Canaan therefore have red eyes, because Ham looked upon the nakedness of his father; they have misshapen lips, because Ham spoke with his lips to his brothers about the unseemly condition of his father; they have twisted curly hair, because Ham turned and twisted his head round to see the nakedness of his father; and they go about naked, because Ham did not cover the nakedness of his father. Thus he was requited, for it is the way of God to mete out punishment measure for measure. Canaan had to suffer vicariously for his father's sin. Yet some of the punishment was inflicted upon him on his own account, for it had been Canaan who had drawn the attention of Ham to Noah's revolting condition. Ham, it appears, was but the worthy father of such a son. The last will and testament of Canaan addressed to his children read as follows: \"Speak not the truth; hold not yourselves aloof from theft; lead a dissolute life; hate your master with an exceeding great hate; and love one another.\" As Ham was made to suffer requital for his irreverence, so Shem and Japheth received a reward for the filial, deferential way in which they took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders, and walking backward, with averted faces, covered the nakedness of their father. Naked the descendants of Ham, the Egyptians and Ethiopians, were led away captive and into exile by the king of Assyria, while the descendants of Shem, the Assyrians, even when the angel of the Lord burnt them in the camp, were not exposed, their garments remained upon their corpses unsinged. And in time to come, when Gog shall suffer his defeat, God will provide both shrouds and a place of burial for him and all his multitude, the posterity of Japheth. Though Shem and Japheth both showed themselves to be dutiful and deferential, yet it was Shem who deserved the larger meed of praise. He was the first to set about covering his father. Japheth joined him after the good deed had been begun. Therefore the descendants of Shem received as their special reward the tallit, the garment worn by them, while the Japhethites have only the toga. A further distinction accorded to Shem was the mention of his name in connection with God's in the blessing of Noah. \"Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem,\" he said, though as a rule the name of God is not joined to the name of a living person, only to the name of one who has departed this life. The relation of Shem to Japheth was expressed in the blessing their father pronounced upon them: God will grant a land of beauty to Japheth, and his sons will be proselytes dwelling in the academies of Shem. At the same time Noah conveyed by his words that the Shekinah would dwell only in the first Temple, erected by Solomon, a son of Shem, and not in the second Temple, the builder of which would be Cyrus, a descendant of Japheth.",

      "content": "When it became known to Ham that his father had cursed him, he fled ashamed, and with his family he settled in the city built by him, and named Neelatamauk for his wife. Jealous of his brother, Japheth followed his example. He likewise built a city which he named for his wife, Adataneses. Shem was the only one of the sons of Noah who did not abandon him. In the vicinity of his father's home, by the mountain, he built his city, to which he also gave his wife's name, Zedeketelbab. The three cities are all near Mount Lubar, the eminence upon which the ark rested. The first lies to the south of it, the second to the west, and the third to the east. Noah endeavored to inculcate the ordinances and the commands known to him upon his children and his children's children. In particular he admonished them against the fornication, the uncleanness, and all the iniquity which had brought the flood down upon the earth. He reproached them with living apart from one another, and with their jealousies, for he feared that, after his death, they might go so far as to shed human blood. Against this he warned them impressively, that they be not annihilated from the earth like those that went before. Another law which he enjoined upon them, to observe it, was the law ordaining that the fruit of a tree shall not be used the first three years it bears, and even in the fourth year it shall be the portion of the priests alone, after a part thereof has been offered upon the altar of God. And having made an end of giving his teachings and injunctions, Noah said: \"For thus did Enoch, your ancestor, exhort his son Methuselah, and Methuselah his son Lamech, and Lamech delivered all unto me as his father had bidden him, and now I do exhort you, my children, as Enoch exhorted his son. When he lived, in his generation, which was the seventh generation of man, he commanded it and testified it unto his children and his children's children, until the day of his death.\" In the year 1569 after the creation of the world, Noah divided the earth by lot among his three sons, in the presence of an angel. Each one stretched forth his hand and took a slip from the bosom of Noah. Shem's slip was inscribed with the middle of the earth, and this portion became the inheritance of his descendants unto all eternity. Noah rejoiced that the lot had assigned it to Shem. Thus was fulfilled his blessing upon him, \"And God in the habitation of Shem,\" for three holy places fell within his precincts—the Holy of Holies in the Temple, Mount Sinai, the middle point of the desert, and Mount Zion, the middle point of the navel of the earth. The south fell to the lot of Ham, and the north became the inheritance of Japheth. The land of Ham is hot, Japheth's cold, but Shem's is neither hot nor cold, its temperature is hot and cold mixed. This division of the earth took place toward the end of the life of Peleg, the name given to him by his father Eber, who, being a prophet, knew that the division of the earth would take place in the time of his son. The brother of Peleg was called Joktan, because the duration of the life of man was shortened in his time. In turn, the three sons of Noah, while they were still standing in the presence of their father, divided each his portion among his children, Noah threatening with his curse any who should stretch out his hand to take a portion not assigned to him by lot. And they all cried, \"So be it! So be it!\" Thus were divided one hundred and four lands and ninety-nine islands among seventy-two nations, each with a language of its own, using sixteen different sets of characters for writing. To Japheth were allotted forty-four lands, thirty-three islands, twenty-two languages, and five kinds of writing; Ham received thirty-four lands, thirty-three islands, twenty-four languages, and five kinds of writing; and Shem twenty-six lands, thirty-three islands, twenty-six languages, and six kinds of writing—one set of written characters more to Shem than to either of his brothers, the extra set being the Hebrew. The land appointed as the inheritance of the twelve sons of Jacob was provisionally granted to Canaan, Zidon, Heth, the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. It was the duty of these nations to take care of the land until the rightful owners should come. No sooner had the children of Noah and their children's children taken possession of the habitations apportioned to them, than the unclean spirits began to seduce men and torment them with pain and all sorts of suffering leading to spiritual and physical death. Upon the entreaties of Noah God sent down the angel Raphael, who banished nine-tenths of the unclean spirits from the earth, leaving but one-tenth for Mastema, to punish sinners through them. Raphael, supported by the chief of the unclean spirits, at that time revealed to Noah all the remedies residing in plants, that he might resort to them at need. Noah recorded them in a book, which he transmitted to his son Shem. This is the source to which go back all the medical books whence the wise men of India, Aram, Macedonia, and Egypt draw their knowledge. The sages of India devoted themselves particularly to the study of curative trees and spices; the Arameans were well versed in the knowledge of the properties of grains and seeds, and they translated the old medical books into their language. The wise men of Macedonia were the first to apply medical knowledge practically, while the Egyptians sought to effect cures by means of magic arts and by means of astrology, and they taught the Midrash of the Chaldees, composed by Kangar, the son of Ur, the son of Kesed. Medical skill spread further and further until the time of aesculapius. This Macedonian sage, accompanied by forty learned magicians, journeyed from country to country, until they came to the land beyond India, in the direction of Paradise. They hoped there to find some wood of the tree of life, and thus spread their fame abroad over the whole world. Their hope was frustrated. When they arrived at the spot, they found healing trees and wood of the tree of life, but when they were in the act of stretching forth their hands to gather what they desired, lightning darted out of the ever-turning sword, smote them to the ground, and they were all burnt. With them disappeared all knowledge of medicine, and it did not revive until the time of the first Artaxerxes, under the Macedonian sage Hippocrates, Dioscorides of Baala, Galen of Caphtor, and the Hebrew Asaph.",

      "content": "With the spread of mankind corruption increased. While Noah was still alive, the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth appointed princes over each of the three groups—Nimrod for the descendants of Ham, Joktan for the descendants of Shem, and Phenech for the descendants of Japheth. Ten years before Noah's death, the number of those subject to the three princes amounted to millions. When this great concourse of men came to Babylonia upon their journeyings, they said to one another: \"Behold, the time is coming when, at the end of days, neighbor will be separated from neighbor, and brother from brother, and one will carry on war against the other. Go to, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven, and let us make us a great name upon the earth. And now let us make bricks, and each one write his name upon his brick.\" All agreed to this proposal, with the exception of twelve pious men, Abraham among them. They refused to join the others. They were seized by the people, and brought before the three princes, to whom they gave the following reason for their refusal: \"We will not make bricks, nor remain with you, for we know but one God, and Him we serve; even if you burn us in the fire together with the bricks, we will not walk in your ways.\" Nimrod and Phenech flew into such a passion over the twelve men that they resolved to throw them into the fire. Joktan, however, besides being a God-fearing man, was of close kin to the men on trial, and he essayed to save them. He proposed to his two colleagues to grant them a seven days' respite. His plan was accepted, such deference being paid him as the primate among the three. The twelve were incarcerated in the house of Joktan. In the night he charged fifty of his attendants to mount the prisoners upon mules and take them to the mountains. Thus they would escape the threatened punishment. Joktan provided them with food for a month. He was sure that in the meantime either a change of sentiment would come about, and the people desist from their purpose, or God would help the fugitives. Eleven of the prisoners assented to the plan with gratitude. Abraham alone rejected it, saying: \"Behold, to-day we flee to the mountains to escape from the fire, but if wild beasts rush out from the mountains and devour us, or if food is lacking, so that we die by famine, we shall be found fleeing before the people of the land and dying in our sins. Now, as the Lord liveth, in whom I trust, I will not depart from this place wherein they have imprisoned me, and if I am to die through my sins, then will I die by the will of God, according to His desire.\" In vain Joktan endeavored to persuade Abraham to flee. He persisted in his refusal. He remained behind alone in the prison house, while the other eleven made their escape. At the expiration of the set term, when the people returned and demanded the death of the twelve captives, Joktan could produce only Abraham. His excuse was that the rest had broken loose during the night. The people were about to throw themselves upon Abraham and cast him into the lime kiln. Suddenly an earthquake was felt, the fire darted from the furnace, and all who were standing round about, eighty four thousand of the people, were consumed, while Abraham remained untouched. Thereupon he repaired to his eleven friends in the mountains, and told them of the miracle that had befallen for his sake. They all returned with him, and, unmolested by the people, they gave praise and thanks to God.",

      "content": "The first among the leaders of the corrupt men was Nimrod. His father Cush had married his mother at an advanced age, and Nimrod, the offspring of this belated union, was particularly dear to him as the son of his old age. He gave him the clothes made of skins with which God had furnished Adam and Eve at the time of their leaving Paradise. Cush himself had gained possession of them through Ham. From Adam and Eve they had descended to Enoch, and from him to Methuselah, and to Noah, and the last had taken them with him into the ark. When the inmates of the ark were about to leave their refuge, Ham stole the garments and kept them concealed, finally passing them on to his first-born son Cush. Cush in turn hid them for many years. When his son Nimrod reached his twentieth year, he gave them to him. These garments had a wonderful property. He who wore them was both invincible and irresistible. The beasts and birds of the woods fell down before Nimrod as soon as they caught sight of him arrayed in them, and he was equally victorious in his combats with men. The source of his unconquerable strength was not known to them. They attributed it to his personal prowess, and therefore they appointed him king over themselves. This was done after a conflict between the descendants of Cush and the descendants of Japheth, from which Nimrod emerged triumphant, having routed the enemy utterly with the assistance of a handful of warriors. He chose Shinar as his capital. Thence he extended his dominion farther and farther, until he rose by cunning and force to be the sole ruler of the whole world, the first mortal to hold universal sway, as the ninth ruler to possess the same power will be the Messiah. His impiousness kept pace with his growing power. Since the flood there had been no such sinner as Nimrod. He fashioned idols of wood and stone, and paid worship to them. But not satisfied to lead a godless life himself, he did all he could to tempt his subjects into evil ways, wherein he was aided and abetted by his son Mardon. This son of his outstripped his father in iniquity. It was their time and their life that gave rise to the proverb, \"Out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness.\" The great success that attended all of Nimrod's undertakings produced a sinister effect. Men no longer trusted in God, but rather in their own prowess and ability, an attitude to which Nimrod tried to convert the whole world. Therefore people said, \"Since the creation of the world there has been none like Nimrod, a mighty hunter of men and beasts, and a sinner before God.\" And not all this sufficed unto Nimrod's evil desire. Not enough that he turned men away from God, he did all he could to make them pay Divine honors unto himself. He set himself up as a god, and made a seat for himself in imitation of the seat of God. It was a tower built out of a round rock, and on it he placed a throne of cedar wood, upon which arose, one above the other, four thrones, of iron, copper, silver, and gold. Crowning all, upon the golden throne, lay a precious stone, round in shape and gigantic in size. This served him as a seat, and as he sate upon it, all nations came and paid him Divine homage.",

      "content": "The iniquity and godlessness of Nimrod reached their climax in the building of the Tower of Babel. His counsellors had proposed the plan of erecting such a tower, Nimrod had agreed to it, and it was executed in Shinar by a mob of six hundred thousand men. The enterprise was neither more nor less than rebellion against God, and there were three sorts of rebels among the builders. The first party spoke, Let us ascend into the heavens and wage warfare with Him; the second party spoke, Let us ascend into the heavens, set up our idols, and pay worship unto them there; and the third party spoke, Let us ascend into the heavens, and ruin them with our bows and spears. Many, many years were passed in building the tower. It reached so great a height that it took a year to mount to the top. A brick was, therefore, more precious in the sight of the builders than a human being. If a man fell down, and met his death, none took notice of it, but if a brick dropped, they wept, because it would take a year to replace it. So intent were they upon accomplishing their purpose that they would not permit a woman to interrupt herself in her work of brick-making when the hour of travail came upon her. Moulding bricks she gave birth to her child, and, tying it round her body in a sheet, she went on moulding bricks. They never slackened in their work, and from their dizzy height they constantly shot arrows toward heaven, which, returning, were seen to be covered with blood. They were thus fortified in their delusion, and they cried, \"We have slain all who are in heaven.\" Thereupon God turned to the seventy angels who encompass His throne, and He spake: \"Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.\" Thus it happened. Thenceforth none knew what the other spoke. One would ask for the mortar, and the other handed him a brick; in a rage, he would throw the brick at his partner and kill him. Many perished in this manner, and the rest were punished according to the nature of their rebellious conduct. Those who had spoken, \"Let us ascend into the heavens, set up our idols, and pay worship unto them there,\" God transformed into apes and phantoms; those who had proposed to assault the heavens with their arms, God set against each other so that they fell in the combat; and those who had resolved to carry on a combat with God in heaven were scattered broadcast over the earth. As for the unfinished tower, a part sank into the earth, and another part was consumed by fire; only one-third of it remained standing. The place of the tower has never lost its peculiar quality. Whoever passes it forgets all he knows. The punishment inflicted upon the sinful generation of the tower is comparatively lenient. On account of rapine the generation of the flood were utterly destroyed, while the generation of the tower were preserved in spite of their blasphemies and all their other acts offensive to God. The reason is that God sets a high value upon peace and harmony. Therefore the generation of the deluge, who gave themselves up to depredation, and bore hatred to one another, were extirpated, root and branch, while the generation of the Tower of Babel dwelling amicably together, and loving one another, were spared alive, at least a remnant of them. Beside the chastisement of sin and sinners by the confounding of speech, another notable circumstance was connected with the descent of God upon earth—one of only ten such descents to occur between the creation of the world and the day of judgment. It was on this occasion that God and the seventy angels that surround His throne cast lots concerning the various nations. Each angel received a nation, and Israel fell to the lot of God. To every nation a peculiar language was assigned, Hebrew being reserved for Israel—the language made use of by God at the creation of the world.",

For the sake of Abraham God had shown himself long-suffering and patient during the lives of these ten generations. Yea, more, the world itself had been created for the sake of his merits. His advent had been made manifest to his ancestor Reu, who uttered the following prophecy at the birth of his son Serug: \"From this child he shall be born in the fourth generation that shall set his dwelling over the highest, and he shall be called perfect and spotless, and shall be the father of nations, and his covenant shall not be dissolved, and his seed shall be multiplied forever.\" It was, indeed, high time that the \"friend of God\" should make his appearance upon earth. The descendants of Noah were sinking from depravity to lower and lower depths of depravity. They were beginning to quarrel and slay, eat blood, build fortified cities and walls and towers, and set one man over the whole nation as king, and wage wars, people against people, and nations against nations, and cities against cities, and do all manner of evil, and acquire weapons, and teach warfare unto their children. And they began also to take captives and sell them as slaves. And they made unto themselves molten images, which they worshipped, each one the idol he had molten for himself, for the evil spirits under their leader Mastema led them astray into sin and uncleanness. For this reason Reu called his son Serug, because all mankind had turned aside unto sin and transgression. When he grew to manhood, the name was seen to have been chosen fittingly, for he, too, worshipped idols, and when he himself had a son, Nahor by name, he taught him the arts of the Chaldees, how to be a soothsayer and practice magic according to signs in the heavens. When, in time, a son was born to Nahor, Mastema sent ravens and other birds to despoil the earth and rob men of the proceeds of their work. As soon as they had dropped the seed in the furrows, and before they could cover it over with earth, the birds picked it up from the surface of the ground, and Nahor called his son Terah, because the ravens and the other birds plagued men, devoured their seed, and reduced them to destitution.",

His birth had been read in the stars by Nimrod, for this impious king was a cunning astrologer, and it was manifest to him that a man would be born in his day who would rise up against him and triumphantly give the lie to his religion. In his terror at the fate foretold him in the stars, he sent for his princes and governors, and asked them to advise him in the matter. They answered, and said: \"Our unanimous advice is that thou shouldst build a great house, station a guard at the entrance thereof, and make known in the whole of thy realm that all pregnant women shall repair thither together with their midwives, who are to remain with them when they are delivered. When the days of a woman to be delivered are fulfilled, and the child is born, it shall be the duty of the midwife to kill it, if it be a boy. But if the child be a girl, it shall be kept alive, and the mother shall receive gifts and costly garments, and a herald shall proclaim, 'Thus is done unto the woman who bears a daughter!'\" The king was pleased with this counsel, and he had a proclamation published throughout his whole kingdom, summoning all the architects to build a great house for him, sixty ells high and eighty wide. After it was completed, he issued a second proclamation, summoning all pregnant women thither, and there they were to remain until their confinement. Officers were appointed to take the women to the house, and guards were stationed in it and about it, to prevent the women from escaping thence. He furthermore sent midwives to the house, and commanded them to slay the men children at their mothers' breasts. But if a woman bore a girl, she was to be arrayed in byssus, silk, and embroidered garments, and led forth from the house of detention amid great honors. No less than seventy thousand children were slaughtered thus. Then the angels appeared before God, and spoke, \"Seest Thou not what he doth, yon sinner and blasphemer, Nimrod son of Canaarl, who slays so many innocent babes that have done no harm?\" God answered, and said: \"Ye holy angels, I know it and I see it, for I neither slumber nor sleep. I behold and I know the secret things and the things that are revealed, and ye shall witness what I will do unto this sinner and blasphemer, for I will turn My hand against him to chastise him.\" It was about this time that Terah espoused the mother of Abraham, and she was with child. When her body grew large at the end of three months of pregnancy, and her countenance became pale, Terah said unto her, \"What ails thee, my wife, that thy countenance is so pale and thy body so swollen?\" She answered, and said, \"Every year I suffer with this malady.\" But Terah would not be put off thus. He insisted: \"Show me thy body. It seems to me thou art big with child. If that be so, it behooves us not to violate the command of our god Nimrod.\" When he passed his hand over her body, there happened a miracle. The child rose until it lay beneath her breasts, and Terah could feel nothing with his hands. He said to his wife, \"Thou didst speak truly,\" and naught became visible until the day of her delivery. When her time approached, she left the city in great terror and wandered toward the desert, walking along the edge of a valley, until she happened across a cave. She entered this refuge, and on the next day she was seized with throes, and she gave birth to a son. The whole cave was filled with the light of the child's countenance as with the splendor of the sun, and the mother rejoiced exceedingly. The babe she bore was our father Abraham. His mother lamented, and said to her son: \"Alas that I bore thee at a time when Nimrod is king. For thy sake seventy thousand men children were slaughtered, and I am seized with terror on account of thee, that he hear of thy existence, and slay thee. Better thou shouldst perish here in this cave than my eye should behold thee dead at my breast.\" She took the garment in which she was clothed, and wrapped it about the boy. Then she abandoned him in the cave, saying, \"May the Lord be with thee, may He not fail thee nor forsake thee.\"",

      "content": "Thus Abraham was deserted in the cave, without a nurse, and he began to wail. God sent Gabriel down to give him milk to drink, and the angel made it to flow from the little finger of the baby's right hand, and he sucked at it until he was ten days old. Then he arose and walked about, and he left the cave, and went along the edge of the valley. When the sun sank, and the stars came forth, he said, \"These are the gods!\" But the dawn came, and the stars could be seen no longer, and then he said, \"I will not pay worship to these, for they are no gods.\" Thereupon the sun came forth, and he spoke, \"This is my god, him will I extol.\" But again the sun set, and he said, \"He is no god,\" and beholding the moon, he called her his god to whom he would pay Divine homage. Then the moon was obscured, and he cried out: \"This, too, is no god! There is One who sets them all in motion.\" He was still communing with himself when the angel Gabriel approached him and met him with the greeting, \"Peace be with thee,\" and Abraham returned, \"With thee be peace,\" and asked, \"Who art thou?\" And Gabriel answered, and said, \"I am the angel Gabriel, the messenger of God,\" and he led Abraham to a spring of water near by, and Abraham washed his face and his hands and feet, and he prayed to God, bowing down and prostrating himself. Meantime the mother of Abraham thought of him in sorrow and tears, and she went forth from the city to seek him in the cave in which she had abandoned him. Not finding her son, she wept bitterly, and said, \"Woe unto me that I bore thee but to become a prey of wild beasts, the bears and the lions and the wolves!\" She went to the edge of the valley, and there she found her son. But she did not recognize him, for he had grown very large. She addressed the lad, \"Peace be with thee!\" and he returned, \"With thee be peace!\" and he continued, \"Unto what purpose didst thou come to the desert?\" She replied, \"I went forth from the city to seek my son.\" Abraham questioned further, \"Who brought thy son hither?\" and the mother replied thereto: \"I had become pregnant from my husband Terah, and when the days of my delivery were fulfilled, I was in anxiety about my son in my womb, lest our king come, the son of Canaan, and slay him as he had slain the seventy thousand other men children. Scarcely had I reached the cave in this valley when the throes of travailing seized me, and I bore a son, whom I left behind in the cave, and I went home again. Now am I come to seek him, but I find him not.\" Abraham then spoke, \"As to this child thou tellest of, how old was it?\" The mother: \"It was about twenty days old.\" Abraham: \"Is there a woman in the world who would forsake her new-born son in the desert, and come to seek him after twenty days?\" The mother: \"Peradventure God will show Himself a merciful God!\" Abraham: \"I am the son whom thou hast come to seek in this valley!\" The mother: \"My son, how thou art grown! But twenty days old, and thou canst already walk, and talk with thy mouth!\" Abraham: \"So it is, and thus, O my mother, it is made known unto thee that there is in the world a great, terrible, living, and ever-existing God, who doth see, but who cannot be seen. He is in the heavens above, and the whole earth is full of His glory.\" The mother: \"My son, is there a God beside Nimrod?\" Abraham: \"Yes, mother, the God of the heavens and the God of the earth, He is also the God of Nimrod son of Canaan. Go, therefore, and carry this message unto Nimrod.\" The mother of Abraham returned to the city and told her husband Terah how she had found their son. Terah, who was a prince and a magnate in the house of the king, betook himself to the royal palace, and cast himself down before the king upon his face. It was the rule that one who prostrated himself before the king was not permitted to lift up his head until the king bade him lift it up. Nimrod gave permission to Terah to rise and state his request. Thereupon Terah related all that had happened with his wife and his son. When Nimrod heard his tale, abject fear seized upon him, and he asked his counsellors and princes what to do with the lad. They answered, and said: \"Our king and our god! Wherefore art thou in fear by reason of a little child? There are myriads upon myriads of princes in thy realm, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens, and overseers without number. Let the pettiest of the princes go and fetch the boy and put him in prison.\" But the king interposed, \"Have ye ever seen a baby of twenty days walking with his feet, speaking with his mouth, and proclaiming with his tongue that there is a God in heaven, who is One, and none beside Him, who sees and is not seen?\" All the assembled princes were horror struck at these words. At this time Satan in human form appeared, clad in black silk garb, and he cast himself down before the king. Nimrod said, \"Raise thy head and state thy request.\" Satan asked the king: \"Why art thou terrified, and why are ye all in fear on account of a little lad? I will counsel thee what thou shalt do: Open thy arsenal and give weapons unto all the princes, chiefs, and governors, and unto all the warriors, and send them to fetch him unto thy service and to be under thy dominion.\" This advice given by Satan the king accepted and followed. He sent a great armed host to bring Abraham to him. When the boy saw the army approach him, he was sore afraid, and amid tears he implored God for help. In answer to his prayer, God sent the angel Gabriel to him, and he said: \"Be not afraid and disquieted, for God is with thee. He will rescue thee out of the hands of all thine adversaries.\" God commanded Gabriel to put thick, dark clouds between Abraham and his assailants. Dismayed by the heavy clouds, they fled, returning to Nimrod, their king, and they said to him, \"Let us depart and leave this realm,\" and the king gave money unto all his princes and his servants, and together with the king they departed and journeyed to Babylon.",

      "content": "Now Abraham, at the command of God, was ordered by the angel Gabriel to follow Nimrod to Babylon. He objected that he was in no wise equipped to undertake a campaign against the king, but Gabriel calmed him with the words: \"Thou needest no provision for the way, no horse to ride upon, no warriors to carry on war with Nimrod, no chariots, nor riders. Do thou but sit thyself upon my shoulder, and I shall bear thee to Babylon.\" Abraham did as he was bidden, and in the twinkling of an eye he found himself before the gates of the city of Babylon. At the behest of the angel, he entered the city, and he called unto the dwellers therein with a loud voice: \"The Eternal, He is the One Only God, and there is none beside. He is the God of the heavens, and the God of the gods, and the God of Nimrod. Acknowledge this as the truth, all ye men, women, and children. Acknowledge also that I am Abraham His servant, the trusted steward of His house.\" Abraham met his parents in Babylon, and also he saw the angel Gabriel, who bade him proclaim the true faith to his father and his mother. Therefore Abraham spake to them, and said: \"Ye serve a man of your own kind, and you pay worship to an image of Nimrod. Know ye not that it has a mouth, but it speaks not; an eye, but it sees not; an ear, but it hears not; nor does it walk upon its feet, and there is no profit in it, either unto itself or unto others?\" When Terah heard these words, he persuaded Abraham to follow him into the house, where his son told him all that had happened—how in one day he had completed a forty days' journey. Terah thereupon went to Nimrod and reported to him that his son Abraham had suddenly appeared in Babylon. The king sent for Abraham, and he came before him with his father. Abraham passed the magnates and the dignitaries until he reached the royal throne, upon which he seized hold, shaking it and crying out with a loud voice: \"O Nimrod, thou contemptible wretch, that deniest the essence of faith, that deniest the living and immutable God, and Abraham His servant, the trusted steward of His house. Acknowledge Him, and repeat after me the words: The Eternal is God, the Only One, and there is none beside; He is incorporeal, living, ever-existing; He slumbers not and sleeps not, who hath created the world that men might believe in Him. And confess also concerning me, and say that I am the servant of God and the trusted steward of His house.\" While Abraham proclaimed this with a loud voice, the idols fell upon their faces, and with them also King Nimrod. For a space of two hours and a half the king lay lifeless, and when his soul returned upon him, he spoke and said, \"Is it thy voice, O Abraham, or the voice of thy God?\" And Abraham answered, and said, \"This voice is the voice of the least of all creatures called into existence by God.\" Thereupon Nimrod said, \"Verily, the God of Abraham is a great and powerful God, the King of all kings,\" and he commanded Terah to take his son and remove him, and return again unto his own city, and father and son did as the king had ordered.",

      "content": "When Abraham attained the age of twenty years, his father Terah fell ill. He spoke as follows to his sons Haran and Abraham, \"I adjure you by your lives, my sons, sell these two idols for me, for I have not enough money to meet our expenses.\" Haran executed the wish of his father, but if any one accosted Abraham, to buy an idol from him, and asked him the price, he would answer, \"Three manehs,\" and then question in turn, \"How old art thou?\" \"Thirty years,\" the reply would be. \"Thou art thirty years of age, and yet thou wouldst worship this idol which I made but to-day?\" The man would depart and go his way, and another would approach Abraham, and ask, \"How much is this idol?\" and \"Five manehs\" would be the reply, and again Abraham would put the question, \"How old art thou?\"—\"Fifty years.\"—\"And dost thou who art fifty years of age bow down before this idol which was made but to-day?\" Thereupon the man would depart and go his way. Abraham then took two idols, put a rope about their necks, and, with their faces turned downward, he dragged them along the ground, crying aloud all the time: \"Who will buy an idol wherein there is no profit, either unto itself or unto him that buys it in order to worship it? It has a mouth, but it speaketh not; eyes, but it seeth not; feet, but it walketh not; ears, but it heareth not.\" The people who heard Abraham were amazed exceedingly at his words. As he went through the streets, he met an old woman who approached him with the purpose of buying an idol, good and big, to be worshipped and loved. \"Old woman, old woman,\" said Abraham, \"I know no profit therein, either in the big ones or in the little ones, either unto themselves or unto others. And,\" he continued to speak to her, \"what has become of the big image thou didst buy from my brother Haran, to worship it?\" \"Thieves,\" she replied, \"came in the night and stole it, while I was still at the bath.\" \"If it be thus,\" Abraham went on questioning her, \"how canst thou pay homage to an idol that cannot save itself from thieves, let alone save others, like thyself, thou silly old woman, out of misfortune? How is it possible for thee to say that the image thou worshippest is a god? If it be a god, why did it not save itself out of the hands of those thieves? Nay, in the idol there is no profit, either unto itself or unto him that adores it.\" The old woman rejoined, \"If what thou sayest be true, whom shall I serve?\" \"Serve the God of all gods,\" returned Abraham, \"the Lord of lords, who hath created heaven and earth, the sea and all therein—the God of Nimrod and the God of Terah, the God of the east, the west, the south, and the north. Who is Nimrod, the dog, who calleth himself a god, that worship be offered unto him?\" Abraham succeeded in opening the eyes of the old woman, and she became a zealous missionary for the true God. When she discovered the thieves who had carried off her idol, and they restored it to her, she broke it in pieces with a stone, and as she wended her way through the streets, she cried aloud, \"Who would save his soul from destruction, and be prosperous in all his doings, let him serve the God of Abraham.\" Thus she converted many men and women to the true belief. Rumors of the words and deeds of the old woman reached the king, and he sent for her. When she appeared before him, he rebuked her harshly, asking her how she dared serve any god but himself. The old woman replied: \"Thou art a liar, thou deniest the essence of faith, the One Only God, beside whom there is no other god. Thou livest upon His bounty, but thou payest worship to another, and thou dost repudiate Him, and His teachings, and Abraham His servant.\" The old woman had to pay for her zeal for the faith with her life. Nevertheless great fear and terror took possession of Nimrod, because the people became more and more attached to the teachings of Abraham, and he knew not how to deal with the man who was undermining the old faith. At the advice of his princes, he arranged a seven days' festival, at which all the people were bidden to appear in their robes of state, their gold and silver apparel. By such display of wealth and power he expected to intimidate Abraham and bring him back to the faith of the king. Through his father Terah, Nimrod invited Abraham to come before him, that he might have the opportunity of seeing his greatness and wealth, and the glory of his dominion, and the multitude of his princes and attendants. But Abraham refused to appear before the king. On the other hand, he granted his father's request that in his absence he sit by his idols and the king's, and take care of them. Alone with the idols, and while he repeated the words, \"The Eternal He is God, the Eternal He is God!\" he struck the king's idols from their thrones, and began to belabor them with an axe. With the biggest he started, and with the smallest he ended. He hacked off the feet of one, and the other he beheaded. This one had his eyes struck out, the other had his hands crushed. After all were mutilated, he went away, having first put the axe into the hand of the largest idol. The feast ended, the king returned, and when he saw all his idols shivered in pieces, he inquired who had perpetrated the mischief. Abraham was named as the one who had been guilty of the outrage, and the king summoned him and questioned him as to his motive for the deed. Abraham replied: \"I did not do it; it was the largest of the idols who shattered all the rest. Seest thou not that he still has the axe in his hand? And if thou wilt not believe my words, ask him and he will tell thee.\"",

      "content": "Now the king was exceedingly wroth at Abraham, and ordered him to be cast into prison, where he commanded the warden not to give him bread or water. But God hearkened unto the prayer of Abraham, and sent Gabriel to him in his dungeon. For a year the angel dwelt with him, and provided him with all sorts of food, and a spring of fresh water welled up before him, and he drank of it. At the end of a year, the magnates of the realm presented themselves before the king, and advised him to cast Abraham into the fire, that the people might believe in Nimrod forever. Thereupon the king issued a decree that all the subjects of the king in all his provinces, men and women, young and old, should bring wood within forty days, and he caused it to be thrown into a great furnace and set afire. The flames shot up to the skies, and the people were sore afraid of the fire. Now the warden of the prison was ordered to bring Abraham forth and cast him in the flames. The warden reminded the king that Abraham had not had food or drink a whole year, and therefore must be dead, but Nimrod nevertheless desired him to step in front of the prison and call his name. If he made reply, he was to be hauled out to the pyre. If he had perished, his remains were to receive burial, and his memory was to be wiped out henceforth. Greatly amazed the warden was when his cry, \"Abraham, art thou alive?\" was answered with \"I am living.\" He questioned further, \"Who has been bringing thee food and drink all these many days?\" and Abraham replied: \"Food and drink have been bestowed upon me by Him who is over all things, the God of all gods and the Lord of all lords, who alone doeth wonders, He who is the God of Nimrod and the God of Terah and the God of the whole world. He dispenseth food and drink unto all beings. He sees, but He cannot be seen, He is in the heavens above, and He is present in all places, for He Himself superviseth all things and provideth for all.\" The miraculous rescue of Abraham from death by starvation and thirst convinced the prison-keeper of the truth of God and His prophet Abraham, and he acknowledged his belief in both publicly. The king's threat of death unless he recanted could not turn him away from his new and true faith. When the hangman raised his sword and set it at his throat to kill him, he exclaimed, \"The Eternal He is God, the God of the whole world as well as of the blasphemer Nimrod.\" But the sword could not cut his flesh. The harder it was pressed against his throat, the more it broke into pieces. Nimrod, however, was not to be turned aside from his purpose, to make Abraham suffer death by fire. One of the princes was dispatched to fetch him forth. But scarcely did the messenger set about the task of throwing him into the fire, when the flame leapt forth from the furnace and consumed him. Many more attempts were made to cast Abraham into the furnace, but always with the same success—whoever seized him to pitch him in was himself burnt, and a large number lost their lives. Satan appeared in human shape, and advised the king to place Abraham in a catapult and sling him into the fire. Thus no one would be required to come near the flame. Satan himself constructed the catapult. Having proved it fit three times by means of stones put in the machine, they bound Abraham, hand and foot, and were about to consign him to the flames. At that moment Satan, still disguised in human shape, approached Abraham, and said, \"If thou desirest to deliver thyself from the fire of Nimrod, bow down before him and believe in him.\" But Abraham rejected the tempter with the words, \"May the Eternal rebuke thee, thou vile, contemptible, accursed blasphemer!\" and Satan departed from him. Then the mother of Abraham came to him and implored him to pay homage to Nimrod and escape the impending misfortune. But he said to her: \"O mother, water can extinguish Nimrod's fire, but the fire of God will not die out for evermore. Water cannot quench it.\" When his mother heard these words, she spake, \"May the God whom thou servest rescue thee from the fire of Nimrod!\" Abraham was finally placed in the catapult, and he raised his eyes heavenward, and spoke, \"O Lord my God, Thou seest what this sinner purposes to do unto me!\" His confidence in God was unshakable. When the angels received the Divine permission to save him, and Gabriel approached him, and asked, \"Abraham, shall I save thee from the fire?\" he replied, \"God in whom I trust, the God of heaven and earth, will rescue me,\" and God, seeing the submissive spirit of Abraham, commanded the fire, \"Cool off and bring tranquillity to my servant Abraham.\" No water was needed to extinguish the fire. The logs burst into buds, and all the different kinds of wood put forth fruit, each tree bearing its own kind. The furnace was transformed into a royal pleasance, and the angels sat therein with Abraham. When the king saw the miracle, he said: \"Great witchcraft! Thou makest it known that fire hath no power over thee, and at the same time thou showest thyself unto the people sitting in a pleasure garden.\" But the princes of Nimrod interposed all with one voice, \"Nay, our lord, this is not witchcraft, it is the power of the great God, the God of Abraham, beside whom there is no other god, and we acknowledge that He is God, and Abraham is His servant.\" All the princes and all the people believed in God at this hour, in the Eternal, the God of Abraham, and they all cried out, \"The Lord He is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath; there is none else.\" Abraham was the superior, not only of the impious king Nimrod and his attendants, but also of the pious men of his time, Noah, Shem, Eber, and Asshur. Noah gave himself no concern whatsoever in the matter of spreading the pure faith in God. He took an interest in planting his vineyard, and was immersed in material pleasures. Shem and Eber kept in hiding, and as for Asshur, he said, \"How can I live among such sinners?\" and departed out of the land. The only one who remained unshaken was Abraham. \"I will not forsake God,\" he said, and therefore God did not forsake him, who had hearkened neither unto his father nor unto his mother. The miraculous deliverance of Abraham from the fiery furnace, together with his later fortunes, was the fulfilment and explanation of what his father Terah had read in the stars. He had seen the star of Haran consumed by fire, and at the same time fill and rule the whole world. The meaning was plain now. Haran was irresolute in his faith, he could not decide whether to adhere to Abraham or the idolaters. When it befell that those who would not serve idols were cast into the fiery furnace, Haran reasoned in this manner: \"Abraham, being my elder, will be called upon before me. If he comes forth out of the fiery trial triumphant, I will declare my allegiance to him; otherwise I will take sides against him.\" After God Himself had rescued Abraham from death, and Haran's turn came to make his confession of faith, he announced his adherence to Abraham. But scarcely had he come near the furnace, when he was seized by the flames and consumed, because he was lacking in firm faith in God. Terah had read the stars well, it now appeared: Haran was burnt, and his daughter Sarah became the wife of Abraham, whose descendants fill the earth. In another way the death of Haran was noteworthy. It was the first instance, since the creation of the world, of a son's dying while his father was still alive. The king, the princes, and all the people, who had been witnesses of the wonders done for Abraham, came to him, and prostrated themselves before him. But Abraham said: \"Do not bow down before me, but before God, the Master of the universe, who hath created you. Serve Him and walk in His ways, for He it was who delivered me from the flames, and He it is who hath created the soul and the spirit of every human being, who formeth man in the womb of his mother, and bringeth him into the world. He saveth from all sickness those who put their trust in Him.\" The king then dismissed Abraham, after loading him down with an abundance of precious gifts, among them two slaves who had been raised in the royal palace. 'Ogi was the name of the one, Eliezer the name of the other. The princes followed the example of the king, and they gave him silver, and gold, and gems. But all these gifts did not rejoice the heart of Abraham so much as the three hundred followers that joined him and became adherents of his religion.",

      "content": "For a period of two years Abraham could devote himself undisturbed to his chosen task of turning the hearts of men to God and His teachings. In his pious undertaking he was aided by his wife Sarah, whom he had married in the meantime. While he exhorted the men and sought to convert them, Sarah addressed herself to the women. She was a helpmeet worthy of Abraham. Indeed, in prophetical powers she ranked higher than her husband. She was sometimes called Iscah, \"the seer,\" on that account. At the expiration of two years it happened that Nimrod dreamed a dream. In his dream he found himself with his army near the fiery furnace in the valley into which Abraham had been cast. A man resembling Abraham stepped out of the furnace, and he ran after the king with drawn sword, the king fleeing before him in terror. While running, the pursuer threw an egg at Nimrod's head, and a mighty stream issued therefrom, wherein the king's whole host was drowned. The king alone survived, with three men. When Nimrod examined his companions, he observed that they wore royal attire, and in form and stature they resembled himself. The stream changed back into an egg again, and a little chick broke forth from it, and it flew up, settled upon the head of the king, and put out one of his eyes. The king was confounded in his sleep, and when he awoke, his heart beat like a trip-hammer, and his fear was exceeding great. In the morning, when he arose, he sent and called for his wise men and his magicians, and told them his dream. One of his wise men, Anoko by name, stood up, and said: \"Know, O king, this dream points to the misfortune which Abraham and his descendants will bring upon thee. A time will come when he and his followers will make war upon thy army, and they will annihilate it. Thou and the three kings, thy allies, will be the only ones to escape death. But later thou wilt lose thy life at the hands of one of the descendants of Abraham. Consider, O king, that thy wise men read this fate of thine in the stars, fifty-two years ago, at the birth of Abraham. As long as Abraham liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be stablished, nor thy kingdom.\" Nimrod took Anoko's words to heart, and dispatched some of his servants to seize Abraham and kill him. It happened that Eliezer, the slave whom Abraham had received as a present from Nimrod, was at that time at the royal court. With great haste he sped to Abraham to induce him to flee before the king's bailiffs. His master accepted his advice, and took refuge in the house of Noah and Shem, where he lay in hiding a whole month. The king's officers reported that despite zealous efforts Abraham was nowhere to be found. Thenceforth the king did not concern himself about Abraham. When Terah visited his son in his hiding-place, Abraham proposed that they leave the land and take up their abode in Canaan, in order to escape the pursuit of Nimrod. He said: \"Consider that it was not for thy sake that Nimrod overloaded thee with honors, but for his own profit. Though he continue to confer the greatest of benefactions upon thee, what are they but earthly vanity? for riches and possessions profit not in the day of wrath and fury. Hearken unto my voice, O my father, let us depart for the land of Canaan, and serve the God that hath created thee, that it may be well with thee.\" Noah and Shem aided and abetted the efforts of Abraham to persuade Terah, whereupon Terah consented to leave his country, and he, and Abraham, and Lot, the son of Haran, departed for Haran with their households. They found the land pleasant, and also the inhabitants thereof, who readily yielded to the influence of Abraham's humane spirit and his piety. Many of them obeyed his precepts and became God-fearing and good. Terah's resolve to quit his native land for the sake of Abraham and take up his abode in strange parts, and his impulse to do it before even the Divine call visited Abraham himself—this the Lord accounted a great merit unto Terah, and he was permitted to see his son Abraham rule as king over the whole world. For when the miracle happened, and Isaac was born unto his aged parents, the whole world repaired to Abraham and Sarah, and demanded to know what they had done that so great a thing should be accomplished for them. Abraham told them all that had happened between Nimrod and himself, how he had been ready to be burnt for the glory of God, and how the Lord had rescued him from the flames. In token of their admiration for Abraham and his teachings, they appointed him to be their king, and in commemoration of Isaac's wondrous birth, the money coined by Abraham bore the figures of an aged husband and wife on the obverse side, and of a young man and his wife on the reverse side, for Abraham and Sarah both were rejuvenated at the birth of Isaac, Abraham's white hair turned black, and the lines in Sarah's face were smoothed out. For many years Terah continued to live a witness of his son's glory, for his death did not occur until Isaac was a youth of thirty-five. And a still greater reward waited upon his good deed. God accepted his repentance, and when he departed this life, he entered into Paradise, and not into hell, though he had passed the larger number of his days in sin. Indeed, it had been his fault that Abraham came near losing his life at the hands of Nimrod.",

      "content": "Terah had been a high official at the court of Nimrod, and he was held in great consideration by the king and his suite. A son was born unto him whom he called Abram, because the king had raised him to an exalted place. In the night of Abraham's birth, the astrologers and the wise men of Nimrod came to the house of Terah, and ate and drank, and rejoiced with him that night. When they left the house, they lifted up their eyes toward heaven to look at the stars, and they saw, and, behold, one great star came from the east and ran athwart the heavens and swallowed up the four stars at the four corners. They all were astonished at the sight, but they understood this matter, and knew its import. They said to one another: \"This only betokens that the child that hath been born unto Terah this night will grow up and be fruitful, and he will multiply and possess all the earth, he and his children forever, and he and his seed will slay great kings and inherit their lands.\" They went home that night, and in the morning they rose up early, and assembled in their meeting-house. They spake, and said to one another: \"Lo, the sight that we saw last night is hidden from the king, it has not been made known to him, and should this thing become known to him in the latter days, he will say to us, Why did you conceal this matter from me? and then we shall all suffer death. Now, let us go and tell the king the sight which we saw, and the interpretation thereof, and we shall be clear from this thing.\" And they went to the king and told him the sight they had seen, and their interpretation thereof, and they added the advice that he pay the value of the child to Terah, and slay the babe. Accordingly, the king sent for Terah, and when he came, he spake to him: \"It hath been told unto me that a son was born to thee yesternight, and a wondrous sign was observed in the heavens at his birth. Now give me the boy, that we may slay him before evil comes upon us from him, and I will give thee thy house full of silver and gold in exchange for him.\" Terah answered: \"This thing which thou promisest unto me is like the words which a man spoke to a mule, saying, 'I will give thee a great heap of barley, a houseful thereof, on condition that I cut off thy head!' The mule replied, 'Of what use will all the barley be to me, if thou cuttest off my head? Who will eat it when thou givest it to me?' Thus also do I say: What shall I do with silver and gold after the death of my son? Who shall inherit me?\" But when Terah saw how the king's anger burned within him at these words, he added, \"Whatever the king desireth to do unto his servant, that let him do, even my son is at the king's disposal, without value or exchange, he and his two older brethren.\" The king spake, however, saying, \"I will purchase thy youngest son for a price.\" And Terah made answer, \"Let my king give me three days' time to consider the matter and consult about it with my family.\" The king agreed to this condition, and on the third day he sent to Terah, saying, \"Give me thy son for a price, as I spoke unto thee, and if thou wilt not do this, I will send and slay all thou hast in thy house, there shall not be a dog left unto thee.\" Then Terah took a child which his handmaid had borne unto him that day, and he brought the babe to the king, and received value for him, and the king took the child and dashed his head against the ground, for he thought it was Abraham. But Terah took his son Abraham, together with the child's mother and his nurse, and concealed them in a cave, and thither he carried provisions to them once a month, and the Lord was with Abraham in the cave, and he grew up, but the king and all his servants thought that Abraham was dead. And when Abraham was ten years old, he and his mother and his nurse went out from the cave, for the king and his servants had forgotten the affair of Abraham. In that time all the inhabitants of the earth, with the exception of Noah and his household, transgressed against the Lord, and they made unto themselves every man his god, gods of wood and stone, which could neither speak, nor hear, nor deliver from distress. The king and all his servants, and Terah with his household, were the first to worship images of wood and stone. Terah made twelve gods of large size, of wood and of stone, corresponding to the twelve months of the year, and he paid homage to them monthly in turn.",

      "content": "Once Abraham went into the temple of the idols in his father's house, to bring sacrifices to them, and he found one of them, Marumath by name, hewn out of stone, lying prostrate on his face before the iron god of Nahor. The idol was too heavy for him to raise it alone, and he called his father to help him put Marumath back in his place. While they were handling the image, its head dropped off, and Terah took a stone, and chiselled another Marumath, setting the head of the first upon the new body. Then Terah continued and made five more gods, and all these he delivered to Abraham, and bade him sell them in the streets of the city. Abraham saddled his mule, and went to the inn where merchants from Fandana in Syria put up on their way to Egypt. He hoped to dispose of his wares there. When he reached the inn, one of the camels belonging to the merchants belched, and the sound frightened his mule so that it ran off pell-mell and broke three of the idols. The merchants not only bought the two sound idols from him, they also gave him the price of the broken ones, for Abraham had told them how distressed he was to appear before his father with less money than he had expected to receive for his handiwork. This incident made Abraham reflect upon the worthlessness of idols, and he said to himself: \"What are these evil things done by my father? Is not he the god of his gods, for do they not come into being by reason of his carving and chiselling and contriving? Were it not more seemly that they should pay worship to him than he to them, seeing they are the work of his hands?\" Meditating thus, he reached his father's house, and he entered and handed his father the money for the five images, and Terah rejoiced, and said, \"Blessed art thou unto my gods, because thou didst bring me the price of the idols, and my labor was not in vain.\" But Abraham made reply: \"Hear, my father Terah, blessed are thy gods through thee, for thou art their god, since thou didst fashion them, and their blessing is destruction and their help is vanity. They that help not themselves, how can they help thee or bless me?\" Terah grew very wrathful at Abraham, that he uttered such speech against his gods, and Abraham, thinking upon his father's anger, left him and went from the house. But Terah called him back, and said, \"Gather together the chips of the oak wood from which I made images before thou didst return, and prepare my dinner for me.\" Abraham made ready to do his father's bidding, and as he took up the chips he found a little god among them, whose forehead bore the inscription \"God Barisat.\" He threw the chips upon the fire, and set Barisat up next to it, saying: \"Attention! Take care, Barisat, that the fire go not out until I come back. If it burns low, blow into it, and make it flame up again.\" Speaking thus, he went out. When he came in again, he found Barisat lying prone upon his back, badly burnt. Smiling, he said to himself, \"In truth, Barisat, thou canst keep the fire alive and prepare food,\" and while he spoke, the idol was consumed to ashes. Then he took the dishes to his father, and he ate and drank and was glad and blessed his god Marumath. But Abraham said to his father, \"Bless not thy god Marumath, but rather thy god Barisat, for he it was who, out of his great love for thee, threw himself into the fire that thy meal might be cooked.\" \"Where is he now?\" exclaimed Terah, and Abraham answered, \"He hath become ashes in the fierceness of the fire.\" Terah said, \"Great is the power of Barisat! I will make me another this day, and to-morrow he will prepare my food for me.\" These words of his father made Abraham laugh in his mind, but his soul was grieved at his obduracy, and he proceeded to make clear his views upon the idols, saying: \"Father, no matter which of the two idols thou blessest, thy behavior is senseless, for the images that stand in the holy temple are more to be worshipped than thine. Zucheus, the god of my brother Nahor, is more venerable than Marumath, because he is made cunningly of gold, and when he grows old, he will be worked over again. But when thy Marumath becomes dim, or is shivered in pieces, he will not be renewed, for he is of stone. And the god Joauv, who stands above the other gods with Zucheus, is more venerable than Barisat, made of wood, because he is hammered out of silver, and ornamented by men, to show his magnificence. But thy Barisat, before thou didst fashion him into a god with thy axe, was rooted in the earth, standing there great and wonderful, with the glory of branches and blossoms. Now he is dry, and gone is his sap. From his height he has fallen to the earth, from grandeur he came to pettiness, and the appearance of his face has paled away, and he himself was burnt in the fire, and he was consumed unto ashes, and he is no more. And thou didst then say, 'I will make me another this day, and to-morrow he will prepare my food for me.' Father,\" Abraham continued, and said, \"the fire is more to be worshipped than thy gods of gold and silver and wood and stone, because it consumes them. But also the fire I call not god, because it is subject to the water, which quenches it. But also the water I call not god, because it is sucked up by the earth, and I call the earth more venerable, because it conquers the water. But also the earth I call not god, because it is dried out by the sun, and I call the sun more venerable than the earth, because he illumines the whole world with his rays. But also the sun I call not god, because his light is obscured when darkness cometh up. Nor do I call the moon and the stars gods, because their light, too, is extinguished when their time to shine is past. But hearken unto this, my father Terah, which I will declare unto thee, The God who hath created all things, He is the true God, He hath empurpled the heavens, and gilded the sun, and given radiance to the moon and also the stars, and He drieth out the earth in the midst of many waters, and also thee hath He put upon the earth, and me hath He sought out in the confusion of my thoughts.\"",

      "content": "But Terah could not be convinced, and in reply to Abraham's question, who the God was that had created heaven and earth and the children of men, he took him to the hall wherein stood twelve great idols and a large number of little idols, and pointing to them he said, \"Here are they who have made all thou seest on earth, they who have created also me and thee and all men on the earth,\" and he bowed down before his gods, and left the hall with his son. Abraham went thence to his mother, and he spoke to her, saying: \"Behold, my father has shown those unto me who made heaven and earth and all the sons of men. Now, therefore, hasten and fetch a kid from the flock, and make of it savory meat, that I may bring it to my father's gods, perhaps I may thereby become acceptable to them.\" His mother did according to his request, but when Abraham brought the offering to the gods, he saw that they had no voice, no hearing, no motion, and not one of them stretched forth his hand to eat. Abraham mocked them, and said, \"Surely, the savory meat that I prepared doth not please you, or perhaps it is too little for you! Therefore I will prepare fresh savory meat to-morrow, better and more plentiful than this, that I may see what cometh therefrom.\" But the gods remained mute and without motion before the second offering of excellent savory meat as before the first offering, and the spirit of God came over Abraham, and he cried out, and said: \"Woe unto my father and his wicked generation, whose hearts are all inclined to vanity, who serve these idols of wood and stone, which cannot eat, nor smell, nor hear, nor speak, which have mouths without speech, eyes without sight, ears without hearing, hands without feeling, and legs without motion!\" Abraham then took a hatchet in his hand, and broke all his father's gods, and when he had done breaking them he placed the hatchet in the hand of the biggest god among them all, and he went out. Terah, having heard the crash of the hatchet on the stone, ran to the room of the idols, and he reached it at the moment when Abraham was leaving it, and when he saw what had happened, he hastened after Abraham, and he said to him, \"What is this mischief thou hast done to my gods?\" Abraham answered: \"I set savory meat before them, and when I came nigh unto them, that they might eat, they all stretched out their hands to take of the meat, before the big one had put forth his hand to eat. This one, enraged against them on account of their behavior, took the hatchet and broke them all, and, behold, the hatchet is yet in his hands, as thou mayest see.\" Then Terah turned in wrath upon Abraham, and he said: \"Thou speakest lies unto me! Is there spirit, soul, or power in these gods to do all thou hast told me? Are they not wood and stone? and have I not myself made them? It is thou that didst place the hatchet in the hand of the big god, and thou sayest he smote them all.\" Abraham answered his father, and said: \"How, then, canst thou serve these idols in whom there is no power to do anything? Can these idols in which thou trustest deliver thee? Can they hear thy prayers when thou callest upon them?\" After having spoken these and similar words, admonishing his father to mend his ways and refrain from worshipping idols, he leapt up before Terah, took the hatchet from the big idol, broke it therewith, and ran away. Terah hastened to Nimrod, bowed down before him, and besought him to hear his story, about his son who had been born to him fifty years back, and how he had done to his gods, and how he had spoken. \"Now, therefore, my lord and king,\" he said, \"send for him that he may come before thee, and do thou judge him according to the law, that we may be delivered from his evil.\" When Abraham was brought before the king, he told him the same story as he had told Terah, about the big god who broke the smaller ones, but the king replied, \"Idols do neither speak, nor eat, nor move.\" Then Abraham reproached him for worshipping gods that can do nothing, and admonished him to serve the God of the universe. His last words were, \"If thy wicked heart will not hearken to my words, to cause thee to forsake thy evil ways and serve the Eternal God, then wilt thou die in shame in the latter days, thou, thy people, and all that are connected with thee, who hear thy words, and walk in thy evil ways.\" The king ordered Abraham to be put into prison, and at the end of ten days he caused all the princes and great men of the realm to appear before him, and to them he put the case of Abraham. Their verdict was that he should be burnt, and, accordingly, the king had a fire prepared for three days and three nights, in his furnace at Kasdim, and Abraham was to be carried thither from prison to be burnt. All the inhabitants of the land, about nine hundred thousand men, and the women and the children besides, came to see what would be done with Abraham. And when he was brought forth, the astrologers recognized him, and they said to the king, \"Surely, this is the man whom we knew as a child, at whose birth the great star swallowed the four stars. Behold, his father did transgress thy command, and he made a mockery of thee, for he did bring thee another child, and him didst thou kill.\" Terah was greatly terrified, for he was afraid of the king's wrath, and he admitted that he had deceived the king, and when the king said, \"Tell me who advised thee to do this. Hide naught, and thou shalt not die,\" he falsely accused Haran, who had been thirty-two years old at the time of Abraham's birth, of having advised him to deceive the king. At the command of the king, Abraham and Haran, stripped of all their clothes except their hosen, and their hands and feet bound with linen cords, were cast into the furnace. Haran, because his heart was not perfect with the Lord, perished in the fire, and also the men who cast them into the furnace were burnt by the flames which leapt out over them, and Abraham alone was saved by the Lord, and he was not burnt, though the cords with which he was bound were consumed. For three days and three nights Abraham walked in the midst of the fire, and all the servants of the king came and told him, \"Behold, we have seen Abraham walking about in the midst of the fire.\" At first the king would not believe them, but when some of his faithful princes corroborated the words of his servants, he rose up and went to see for himself. He then commanded his servants to take Abraham from the fire, but they could not, because the flames leapt toward them from the furnace, and when they tried again, at the king's command, to approach the furnace, the flames shot out and burnt their faces, so that eight of their number died. The king then called unto Abraham, and said: \"O servant of the God who is in heaven, go forth from the midst of the fire, and come hither and stand before me,\" and Abraham came and stood before the king. And the king spoke to Abraham, and said, \"How cometh it that thou wast not burnt in the fire?\" And Abraham made answer, \"The God of heaven and earth in whom I trust, and who hath all things in His power, He did deliver me from the fire into which thou didst cast me.\"",

      "content": "With ten temptations Abraham was tempted, and he withstood them all, showing how great was the love of Abraham. The first test to which he was subjected was the departure from his native land. The hardships were many and severe which he encountered, and he was loth to leave his home, besides. He spoke to God, and said, \"Will not the people talk about me, and say, 'He is endeavoring to bring the nations under the wings of the Shekinah, yet he leaves his old father in Haran, and he goes away.'\" But God answered him, and said: \"Dismiss all care concerning thy father and thy kinsmen from thy thoughts. Though they speak words of kindness to thee, yet are they all of one mind, to ruin thee.\" Then Abraham forsook his father in Haran, and journeyed to Canaan, accompanied by the blessing of God, who said unto him, \"I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great.\" These three blessings were to counteract the evil consequences which, he feared, would follow emigration, for travelling from place to place interferes with the growth of the family, it lessens one's substance, and it diminishes the consideration one enjoys. The greatest of all blessings, however, was the word of God, \"And be thou a blessing.\" The meaning of this was that whoever came in contact with Abraham was blessed. Even the mariners on the sea were indebted to him for prosperous voyages. Besides, God held out the promise to him that in time to come his name would be mentioned in the Benedictions, God would be praised as the Shield of Abraham, a distinction accorded to no other mortal except David. But the words, \"And be thou a blessing,\" will be fulfilled only in the future world, when the seed of Abraham shall be known among the nations and his offspring among the peoples as \"the seed which the Lord hath blessed.\" When Abraham first was bidden to leave his home, he was not told to what land he was to journey—all the greater would be his reward for executing the command of God. And Abraham showed his trust in God, for he said, \"I am ready to go whithersoever Thou sendest me.\" The Lord then bade him go to a land wherein He would reveal Himself, and when he went to Canaan later, God appeared to him, and he knew that it was the promised land. On entering Canaan, Abraham did not yet know that it was the land appointed as his inheritance. Nevertheless he rejoiced when he reached it. In Mesopotamia and in Aramnaharaim, the inhabitants of which he had seen eating, drinking, and acting wantonly, he had always wished, \"O that my portion may not be in this land,\" but when he came to Canaan, he observed that the people devoted themselves industriously to the cultivation of the land, and he said, \"O that my portion may be in this land!\" God then spoke to him, and said, \"Unto thy seed will I give this land.\" Happy in these joyous tidings, Abraham erected an altar to the Lord to give thanks unto Him for the promise, and then he journeyed on, southward, in the direction of the spot whereon the Temple was once to stand. In Hebron he again erected an altar, thus taking possession of the land in a measure. And likewise he raised an altar in Ai, because he foresaw that a misfortune would befall his offspring there, at the conquest of the land under Joshua. The altar, he hoped, would obviate the evil results that might follow. Each altar raised by him was a centre for his activities as a missionary. As soon as he came to a place in which he desired to sojourn, he would stretch a tent first for Sarah, and next for himself, and then he would proceed at once to make proselytes and bring them under the wings of the Shekinah. Thus he accomplished his purpose of inducing all men to proclaim the Name of God. For the present Abraham was but a stranger in his promised land. After the partition of the earth among the sons of Noah, when all had gone to their allotted portions, it happened that Canaan son of Ham saw that the land extending from the Lebanon to the River of Egypt was fair to look upon, and he refused to go to his own allotment, westward by the sea. He settled in the land upon Lebanon, eastward and westward from the border of the Jordan and the border of the sea. And Ham, his father, and his brothers Cush and Mizraim spoke to him, and said: \"Thou livest in a land that is not thine, for it was not assigned unto us when the lots were drawn. Do not thus! But if thou persistest, ye, thou and thy children, will fall, accursed, in the land, in a rebellion. Thy settling here was rebellion, and through rebellion thy children will be felled down, and thy seed will be destroyed unto all eternity. Sojourn not in the land of Shem, for unto Shem and unto the children of Shem was it apportioned by lot. Accursed art thou, and accursed wilt thou be before all the children of Noah on account of the curse, for we took an oath before the holy Judge and before our father Noah.\" But Canaan hearkened not unto the words of his father and his brothers. He dwelt in the land of the Lebanon from Hamath even unto the entrance of Egypt, he and his sons. Though the Canaanites had taken unlawful possession of the land, yet Abraham respected their rights; he provided his camels with muzzles, to prevent them from pasturing upon the property of others.",

      "content": "Scarcely had Abraham established himself in Canaan, when a devastating famine broke out—one of the ten God appointed famines for the chastisement of men. The first of them came in the time of Adam, when God cursed the ground for his sake; the second was this one in the time of Abraham; the third compelled Isaac to take up his abode among the Philistines; the ravages of the fourth drove the sons of Jacob into Egypt to buy grain for food; the fifth came in the time of the Judges, when Elimelech and his family had to seek refuge in the land of Moab; the sixth occurred during the reign of David, and it lasted three years; the seventh happened in the day of Elijah, who had sworn that neither rain nor dew should fall upon the earth; the eighth was the one in the time of Elisha, when an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver; the ninth is the famine that comes upon men piecemeal, from time to time; and the tenth will scourge men before the advent of Messiah, and this last will be \"not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.\" The famine in the time of Abraham prevailed only in Canaan, and it had been inflicted upon the land in order to test his faith. He stood this second temptation as he had the first. He murmured not, and he showed no sign of impatience toward God, who had bidden him shortly before to abandon his native land for a land of starvation. The famine compelled him to leave Canaan for a time, and he repaired to Egypt, to become acquainted there with the wisdom of the priests and, if necessary, give them instruction in the truth. On this journey from Canaan to Egypt, Abraham first observed the beauty of Sarah. Chaste as he was, he had never before looked at her, but now, when they were wading through a stream, he saw the reflection of her beauty in the water like the brilliance of the sun. Wherefore he spoke to her thus, \"The Egyptians are very sensual, and I will put thee in a casket that no harm befall me on account of thee.\" At the Egyptian boundary, the tax collectors asked him about the contents of the casket, and Abraham told them he had barley in it. \"No,\" they said, \"it contains wheat.\" \"Very well,\" replied Abraham, \"I am prepared to pay the tax on wheat.\" The officers then hazarded the guess, \"It contains pepper!\" Abraham agreed to pay the tax on pepper, and when they charged him with concealing gold in the casket, he did not refuse to pay the tax on gold, and finally on precious stones. Seeing that he demurred to no charge, however high, the tax collectors, made thoroughly suspicious, insisted upon his unfastening the casket and letting them examine the contents. When it was forced open, the whole of Egypt was resplendent with the beauty of Sarah. In comparison with her, all other beauties were like apes compared with men. She excelled Eve herself. The servants of Pharaoh outbid one another in seeking to obtain possession of her, though they were of opinion that so radiant a beauty ought not to remain the property of a private individual. They reported the matter to the king, and Pharaoh sent a powerful armed force to bring Sarah to the palace, and so bewitched was he by her charms that those who had brought him the news of her coming into Egypt were loaded down with bountiful gifts. Amid tears, Abraham offered up a prayer. He entreated God in these words: \"Is this the reward for my confidence in Thee? For the sake of Thy grace and Thy lovingkindness, let not my hope be put to shame.\" Sarah also implored God, saying: \"O God, Thou didst bid my lord Abraham leave his home, the land of his fathers, and journey to Canaan, and Thou didst promise him to do good unto him if he fulfilled Thy commands. And now we have done as Thou didst command us to do. We left our country and our kindred, and we journeyed to a strange land, unto a people which we knew not heretofore. We came hither to save our people from starvation, and now hath this terrible misfortune befallen. O Lord, help me and save me from the hand of this enemy, and for the sake of Thy grace show me good.\" An angel appeared unto Sarah while she was in the presence of the king, to whom he was not visible, and he bade her take courage, saying, \"Fear naught, Sarah, for God hath heard thy prayer.\" The king questioned Sarah as to the man in the company of whom she had come to Egypt, and Sarah called Abraham her brother. Pharaoh pledged himself to make Abraham great and powerful, to do for him whatever she wished. He sent much gold and silver to Abraham, and diamonds and pearls, sheep and oxen, and men slaves and women slaves, and he assigned a residence to him within the precincts of the royal palace. In the love he bore Sarah, he wrote out a marriage contract, deeding to her all he owned in the way of gold and silver, and men slaves and women slaves, and the province of Goshen besides, the province occupied in later days by the descendants of Sarah, because it was their property. Most remarkable of all, he gave her his own daughter Hagar as slave, for he preferred to see his daughter the servant of Sarah to reigning as mistress in another harem. His free-handed generosity availed naught. During the night, when he was about to approach Sarah, an angel appeared armed with a stick, and if Pharaoh but touched Sarah's shoe to remove it from her foot, the angel planted a blow upon his hand, and when he grasped her dress, a second blow followed. At each blow he was about to deal, the angel asked Sarah whether he was to let it descend, and if she bade him give Pharaoh a moment to recover himself, he waited and did as she desired. And another great miracle came to pass. Pharaoh, and his nobles, and his servants, the very walls of his house and his bed were afflicted with leprosy, and he could not indulge his carnal desires. This night in which Pharaoh and his court suffered their well deserved punishment was the night of the fifteenth of Nisan, the same night wherein God visited the Egyptians in a later time in order to redeem Israel, the descendants of Sarah. Horrified by the plague sent upon him, Pharaoh inquired how he could rid himself thereof. He applied to the priests, from whom he found out the true cause of his affliction, which was corroborated by Sarah. He then sent for Abraham and returned his wife to him, pure and untouched, and excused himself for what had happened, saying that he had had the intention of connecting himself in marriage with him, whom he had thought to be the brother of Sarah. He bestowed rich gifts upon the husband and the wife, and they departed for Canaan, after a three months' sojourn in Egypt. Arrived in Canaan they sought the same night-shelters at which they had rested before, in order to pay their accounts, and also to teach by their example that it is not proper to seek new quarters unless one is forced to it. Abraham's sojourn in Egypt was of great service to the inhabitants of the country, because he demonstrated to the wise men of the land how empty and vain their views were, and also he taught them astronomy and astrology, unknown in Egypt before his time.",

      "content": "The Egyptian ruler, whose meeting with Abraham had proved so untoward an event, was the first to bear the name Pharaoh. The succeeding kings were named thus after him. The origin of the name is connected with the life and adventures of Rakyon, Have-naught, a man wise, handsome, and poor, who lived in the land of Shinar. Finding himself unable to support himself in Shinar, he resolved to depart for Egypt, where he expected to display his wisdom before the king, Ashwerosh, the son of 'Anam. Perhaps he would find grace in the eyes of the king, who would give Rakyon the opportunity of supporting himself and rising to be a great man. When he reached Egypt, he learnt that it was the custom of the country for the king to remain in retirement in his palace, removed from the sight of the people. Only on one day of the year he showed himself in public, and received all who had a petition to submit to him. Richer by a disappointment, Rakyon knew not how he was to earn a livelihood in the strange country. He was forced to spend the night in a ruin, hungry as he was. The next day he decided to try to earn something by selling vegetables. By a lucky chance he fell in with some dealers in vegetables, but as he did not know the customs of the country, his new undertaking was not favored with good fortune. Ruffians assaulted him, snatched his wares from him, and made a laughing-stock of him. The second night, which he was compelled to spend in the ruin again, a sly plan ripened in his mind. He arose and gathered together a crew of thirty lusty fellows. He took them to the graveyard, and bade them, in the name of the king, charge two hundred pieces of silver for every body they buried. Otherwise interment was to be prevented. In this way he succeeded in amassing great wealth within eight months. Not only did he acquire silver, gold, and precious gems, but also he attached a considerable force, armed and mounted, to his person. On the day on which the king appeared among the people, they began to complain of this tax upon the dead. They said: \"What is this thou art inflicting upon thy servants—permitting none to be buried unless they pay thee silver and gold! Has a thing like this come to pass in the world since the days of Adam, that the dead should not be interred unless money be paid therefor! We know well that it is the privilege of the king to take an annual tax from the living. But thou takest tribute from the dead, too, and thou exactest it day by day. O king, we cannot endure this any longer, for the whole of the city is ruined thereby.\" The king, who had had no suspicion of Rakyon's doings, fell into a great rage when the people gave him information about them. He ordered him and his armed force to appear before him. Rakyon did not come empty-handed. He was preceded by a thousand youths and maidens, mounted upon steeds and arrayed in state apparel. These were a present to the king. When he himself stepped before the king, he delivered gold, silver, and diamonds to him in great abundance, and a magnificent charger. These gifts and the display of splendor did not fail of taking effect upon the king, and when Rakyon, in well-considered words and with a pliant tongue, described the undertaking, he won not only the king to his side, but also the whole court, and the king said to him, \"No longer shalt thou be called Rakyon, Have-naught, but Pharaoh, Paymaster, for thou didst collect taxes from the dead.\" So profound was the impression made by Rakyon that the king, the grandees, and the people, all together resolved to put the guidance of the realm in the hands of Pharaoh. Under the suzerainty of Ashwerosh he administered law and justice throughout the year; only on the one day when he showed himself to the people did the king himself give judgment and decide cases. Through the power thus conferred upon him and through cunning practices, Pharaoh succeeded in usurping royal authority, and he collected taxes from all the inhabitants of Egypt. Nevertheless he was beloved of the people, and it was decreed that every ruler of Egypt should thenceforth bear the name Pharaoh.",

      "content": "On his return from Egypt Abraham's relations to his own family were disturbed by annoying circumstances. Strife developed between the herdmen of his cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle. Abraham furnished his herds with muzzles, but Lot made no such provision, and when the shepherds that pastured Abraham's flocks took Lot's shepherds to task on account of the omission, the latter replied: \"It is known of a surety that God said unto Abraham, 'To thy seed will I give the land.' But Abraham is a sterile mule. Never will he have children. On the morrow he will die, and Lot will be his heir. Thus the flocks of Lot are but consuming what belongs to them or their master.\" But God spoke: \"Verily, I said unto Abraham I would give the land unto his seed, but only after the seven nations shall have been destroyed from out of the land. To-day the Canaanites are therein, and the Perizzites. They still have the right of habitation.\" Now, when the strife extended from the servants to the masters, and Abraham vainly called his nephew Lot to account for his unbecoming behavior, Abraham decided he would have to part from his kinsman, though he should have to compel Lot thereto by force. Lot thereupon separated himself not from Abraham alone, but from the God of Abraham also, and he betook himself to a district in which immorality and sin reigned supreme, wherefore punishment overtook him, for his own flesh seduced him later unto sin. God was displeased with Abraham for not living in peace and harmony with his own kindred, as he lived with all the world beside. On the other hand, God also took it in ill part that Abraham was accepting Lot tacitly as his heir, though He had promised him, in clear, unmistakable words, \"To thy seed will I give the land.\" After Abraham had separated himself from Lot, he received the assurance again that Canaan should once belong to his seed, which God would multiply as the sand which is upon the sea-shore. As the sand fills the whole earth, so the offspring of Abraham would be scattered over the whole earth, from end to end; and as the earth is blessed only when it is moistened with water, so his offspring would be blessed through the Torah, which is likened unto water; and as the earth endures longer than metal, so his offspring would endure forever, while the heathen would vanish; and as the earth is trodden upon, so his offspring would be trodden upon by the four kingdoms. The departure of Lot had a serious consequence, for the war waged by Abraham against the four kings is intimately connected with it. Lot desired to settle in the well-watered circle of the Jordan, but the only city of the plain that would receive him was Sodom, the king of which admitted the nephew of Abraham out of consideration for the latter. The five impious kings planned first to make war upon Sodom on account of Lot and then advance upon Abraham. For one of the five, Amraphel, was none other than Nimrod, Abraham's enemy from of old. The immediate occasion for the war was this: Chedorlaomer, one of Nimrod's generals, rebelled against him after the builders of the tower were dispersed, and he set himself up as king of Elam. Then he subjugated the Hamitic tribes living in the five cities of the plain of the Jordan, and made them tributary. For twelve years they were faithful to their sovereign ruler Chedorlaomer, but then they refused to pay the tribute, and they persisted in their insubordination for thirteen years. Making the most of Chedorlaomer's embarrassment, Nimrod led a host of seven thousand warriors against his former general. In the battle fought between Elam and Shinar, Nimrod suffered a disastrous defeat, he lost six hundred of his army, and among the slain was the king's son Mardon. Humiliated and abased, he returned to his country, and he was forced to acknowledge the suzerainty of Chedorlaomer, who now proceeded to form an alliance with Arioch king of Ellasar, and Tidal, the king of several nations, the purpose of which was to crush the cities of the circle of the Jordan. The united forces of these kings, numbering eight hundred thousand, marched upon the five cities, subduing whatever they encountered in their course, and annihilating the descendants of the giants. Fortified places, unwalled cities, and flat, open country, all fell in their hands. They pushed on through the desert as far as the spring issuing from the rock at Kadesh, the spot appointed by God as the place of pronouncing judgment against Moses and Aaron on account of the waters of strife. Thence they turned toward the central portion of Palestine, the country of dates, where they encountered the five godless kings, Bera, the villain, king of Sodom; Birsha, the sinner, king of Gomorrah; Shinab, the father-hater, king of Admah; Shemeber, the voluptuary, king of Zeboiim; and the king of Bela, the city that devours its inhabitants. The five were routed in the fruitful Vale of Siddim, the canals of which later formed the Dead Sea. They that remained of the rank and file fled to the mountains, but the kings fell into the slime pits and stuck there. Only the king of Sodom was rescued, miraculously, for the purpose that he might convert those heathen to faith in God that had not believed in the wonderful deliverance of Abraham from the fiery furnace. The victors despoiled Sodom of all its goods and victuals, and took Lot, boasting, \"We have taken the son of Abraham's brother captive,\" so betraying the real object of their undertaking; their innermost desire was to strike at Abraham. It was on the first evening of the Passover, and Abraham was eating of the unleavened bread, when the archangel Michael brought him the report of Lot's captivity. This angel bears another name besides, Palit, the escaped, because when God threw Samael and his host from their holy place in heaven, the rebellious leader held on to Michael and tried to drag him along downward, and Michael escaped falling from heaven only through the help of God. When the report of his nephew's evil state reached Abraham, he straightway dismissed all thought of his dissensions with Lot from his mind, and only considered ways and means of deliverance. He convoked his disciples to whom he had taught the true faith, and who all called themselves by the name Abraham. He gave them gold and silver, saying at the same time: \"Know that we go to war for the purpose of saving human lives. Therefore, do ye not direct your eyes upon money, here lie gold and silver before you.\" Furthermore he admonished them in these words: \"We are preparing to go to war. Let none join us who hath committed a trespass, and fears that Divine punishment will descend upon him.\" Alarmed by his warning, not one would obey his call to arms, they were fearful on account of their sins. Eliezer alone remained with him, wherefore God spake, and said: \"All forsook thee save only Eliezer. Verily, I shall invest him with the strength of the three hundred and eighteen men whose aid thou didst seek in vain.\" The battle fought with the mighty hosts of the kings, from which Abraham emerged victorious, happened on the fifteenth of Nisan, the night appointed for miraculous deeds. The arrows and stones hurled at him effected naught, but the dust of the ground, the chaff, and the stubble which he threw at the enemy were transformed into death-dealing javelins and swords. Abraham, as tall as seventy men set on end, and requiring as much food and drink as seventy men, marched forward with giant strides, each of his steps measuring four miles, until he overtook the kings, and annihilated their troops. Further he could not go, for he had reached Dan, where Jeroboam would once raise the golden calves, and on this ominous spot Abraham's strength diminished. His victory was possible only because the celestial powers espoused his side. The planet Jupiter made the night bright for him, and an angel, Lailah by name, fought for him. In a true sense, it was a victory of God. All the nations acknowledged his more than human achievement, and they fashioned a throne for Abraham, and erected it on the field of battle. When they attempted to seat him upon it, amid exclamations of \"Thou art our king! Thou art our prince! Thou art our god!\" Abraham warded them off, and said, \"The universe has its King, and it has its God!\" He declined all honors, and returned his property unto each man. Only the little children he kept by himself. He reared them in the knowledge of God, and later they atoned for the disgrace of their parents. Somewhat arrogantly the king of Sodom set out to meet Abraham. He was proud that a great miracle, his rescue from the slime pit, had been performed for him, too. He made Abraham the proposition that he keep the despoiled goods for himself. But Abraham refused them, and said: \"I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, God Most High, who hath created the world for the sake of the pious, that I will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine. I have no right upon any goods taken as spoils, save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who tarried by the stuff, though they went not down to the battle itself.\" The example of Abraham in giving a share in the spoils even unto the men not concerned directly in the battle, was followed later by David, who heeded not the protest of the wicked men and the base fellows with him, that the watchers who staid by the stuff were not entitled to share alike with the warriors that had gone down to the battle. In spite of his great success, Abraham nevertheless was concerned about the issue of the war. He feared that the prohibition against shedding the blood of man had been transgressed, and he also dreaded the resentment of Shem, whose descendants had perished in the encounter. But God reassured him, and said: \"Be not afraid! Thou hast but extirpated the thorns, and as to Shem, he will bless thee rather than curse thee.\" So it was. When Abraham returned from the war, Shem, or, as he is sometimes called, Melchizedek, the king of righteousness, priest of God Most High, and king of Jerusalem, came forth to meet him with bread and wine. And this high priest instructed Abraham in the laws of the priesthood and in the Torah, and to prove his friendship for him he blessed him, and called him the partner of God in the possession of the world, seeing that through him the Name of God had first been made known among men. But Melchizedek arranged the words of his blessing in an unseemly way. He named Abraham first and then God. As a punishment, he was deposed by God from the priestly dignity, and instead it was passed over to Abraham, with whose descendants it remained forever. As a reward for the sanctification of the Holy Name, which Abraham had brought about when he refused to keep aught of the goods taken in battle, his descendants received two commands, the command of the threads in the borders of their garments, and the command of the latchets to be bound upon their hands and to be used as frontlets between their eyes. Thus they commemorate that their ancestor refused to take so much as a thread or a latchet. And because he would not touch a shoe-latchet of the spoils, his descendants cast their shoe upon Edom.",

      "content": "Shortly after the war, God revealed Himself unto Abraham, to soothe his conscience as to the spilling of innocent blood, for it was a scruple that gave him much anguish of spirit. God assured him at the same time that He would cause pious men to arise among his descendants, who, like himself, would be a shield unto their generation. As a further distinction, God gave him leave to ask what he would have, rare grace accorded to none beside, except Jacob, Solomon, Ahaz, and the Messiah. Abraham spoke, and said: \"O Lord of the world, if in time to come my descendants should provoke Thy wrath, it were better I remained childless. Lot, for the sake of whom I journeyed as far as Damascus, where God was my protection, would be well pleased to be my heir. Moreover, I have read in the stars, 'Abraham, thou wilt beget no children.'\" Thereupon God raised Abraham above the vault of the skies, and He said, \"Thou art a prophet, not an astrologer!\" Now Abraham demanded no sign that he would be blessed with offspring. Without losing another word, he believed in the Lord, and he was rewarded for his simple faith by a share in this world and a share in the world to come as well, and, besides, the redemption of Israel from the exile will take place as a recompense for his firm trust. But though he believed the promise made him with a full and abiding faith, he yet desired to know by what merit of theirs his descendants would maintain themselves. Therefore God bade him bring Him a sacrifice of three heifers, three she-goats, three rams, a turtle dove, and a young pigeon, thus indicating to Abraham the various sacrifices that should once be brought in the Temple, to atone for the sins of Israel and further his welfare. \"But what will become of my descendants,\" asked Abraham, \"after the Temple is destroyed?\" God replied, and said, \"If they read the order of sacrifices as they will be set down in the Scriptures, I will account it unto them as though they had offered the sacrifices, and I will forgive all their sins.\" And God continued and revealed to Abraham the course of Israel's history and the history of the whole world: The heifer of three years indicates the dominion of Babylon, the she-goat of three years stands for the empire of the Greeks, the ram of three years for the Medo-Persian power, the rule of Ishmael is represented by the ram, and Israel is the innocent dove. Abraham took him these animals and divided them in the midst. Had he not done so, Israel would not have been able to resist the power of the four kingdoms. But the birds he divided not, to indicate that Israel will remain whole. And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abraham drove them away. Thus was announced the advent of the Messiah, who will cut the heathen in pieces, but Abraham bade Messiah wait until the time appointed unto him. And as the Messianic time was made known unto Abraham, so also the time of the resurrection of the dead. When he laid the halves of the pieces over against each other, the animals became alive again, as the bird flew over them. While he was preparing these sacrifices, a vision of great import was granted to Abraham. The sun sank, and a deep sleep fell upon him, and he beheld a smoking furnace, Gehenna, the furnace that God prepares for the sinner; and he beheld a flaming torch, the revelation on Sinai, where all the people saw flaming torches; and he beheld the sacrifices to be brought by Israel; and an horror of great darkness fell upon him, the dominion of the four kingdoms. And God spake to him: \"Abraham, as long as thy children fulfil the two duties of studying the Torah and performing the service in the Temple, the two visitations, Gehenna and alien rule, will be spared them. But if they neglect the two duties, they will have to suffer the two chastisements; only thou mayest choose whether they shall be punished by means of Gehenna or by means of the dominion of the stranger.\" All the day long Abraham wavered, until God called unto him: \"How long wilt thou halt between two opinions? Decide for one of the two, and let it be for the dominion of the stranger!\" Then God made known to him the four hundred years' bondage of Israel in Egypt, reckoning from the birth of Isaac, for unto Abraham himself was the promise given that he should go to his fathers in peace, and feel naught of the arrogance of the stranger oppressor. At the same time, it was made known to Abraham that his father Terah would have a share in the world to come, for he had done penance for his sinful deeds. Furthermore it was revealed to him that his son Ishmael would turn into the path of righteousness while yet his father was alive, and his grandson Esau would not begin his impious way of life until he himself had passed away. And as he received the promise of their deliverance together with the announcement of the slavery of his seed, in a land not theirs, so it was made known to him that God would judge the four kingdoms and destroy them.",

      "content": "The covenant of the pieces, whereby the fortunes of his descendants were revealed to Abraham, was made at a time when he was still childless. As long as Abraham and Sarah dwelt outside of the Holy Land, they looked upon their childlessness as a punishment for not abiding within it. But when a ten years' sojourn in Palestine found her barren as before, Sarah perceived that the fault lay with her. Without a trace of jealousy she was ready to give her slave Hagar to Abraham as wife, first making her a freed woman. For Hagar was Sarah's property, not her husband's. She had received her from Pharaoh, the father of Hagar. Taught and bred by Sarah, she walked in the same path of righteousness as her mistress, and thus was a suitable companion for Abraham, and, instructed by the holy spirit, he acceded to Sarah's proposal. No sooner had Hagar's union with Abraham been consummated, and she felt that she was with child, than she began to treat her former mistress contemptuously, though Sarah was particularly tender toward her in the state in which she was. When noble matrons came to see Sarah, she was in the habit of urging them to pay a visit to \"poor Hagar,\" too. The dames would comply with her suggestion, but Hagar would use the opportunity to disparage Sarah. \"My lady Sarah,\" she would say, \"is not inwardly what she appears to be outwardly. She makes the impression of a righteous, pious woman, but she is not, for if she were, how could her childlessness be explained after so many years of marriage, while I became pregnant at once?\" Sarah scorned to bicker with her slave, yet the rage she felt found vent in these words to Abraham: \"It is thou who art doing me wrong. Thou hearest the words of Hagar, and thou sayest naught to oppose them, and I hoped that thou wouldst take my part. For thy sake did I leave my native land and the house of my father, and I followed thee into a strange land with trust in God. In Egypt I pretended to be thy sister, that no harm might befall thee. When I saw that I should bear no children, I took the Egyptian woman, my slave Hagar, and gave her unto thee for wife, contenting myself with the thought that I would rear the children she would bear. Now she treats me disdainfully in thy presence. O that God might look upon the injustice which hath been done unto me, to judge between thee and me, and have mercy upon us, restore peace to our home, and grant us offspring, that we have no need of children from Hagar, the Egyptian bondwoman of the generation of the heathen that cast thee in the fiery furnace!\" Abraham, modest and unassuming as he was, was ready to do justice to Sarah, and he conferred full power upon her to dispose of Hagar according to her pleasure. He added but one caution, \"Having once made her a mistress, we cannot again reduce her to the state of a bondwoman.\" Unmindful of this warning, Sarah exacted the services of a slave from Hagar. Not alone this, she tormented her, and finally she cast an evil eye upon her, so that the unborn child dropped from her, and she ran away. On her flight she was met by several angels, and they bade her return, at the same time making known to her that she would bear a son who should be called Ishmael—one of the six men who have been given a name by God before their birth, the others being Isaac, Moses, Solomon, Josiah, and the Messiah. Thirteen years after the birth of Ishmael the command was issued to Abraham that he put the sign of the covenant upon his body and upon the bodies of the male members of his household. Abraham was reluctant at first to do the bidding of God, for he feared that the circumcision of his flesh would raise a barrier between himself and the rest of mankind. But God said unto him, \"Let it suffice thee that I am thy God and thy Lord, as it sufficeth the world that I am its God and its Lord.\" Abraham then consulted with his three true friends, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, regarding the command of the circumcision. The first one spoke, and said, \"Thou art nigh unto a hundred years old, and thou considerest inflicting such pain upon thyself?\" The advice of the second was also against it. \"What,\" said Eshcol, \"thou choosest to mark thyself so that thy enemies may recognize thee without fail?\" Mamre, the third, was the only one to advise obedience to the command of God. \"God succored thee from the fiery furnace,\" he said, \"He helped thee in the combat with the kings, He provided for thee during the famine, and thou dost hesitate to execute His behest concerning the circumcision?\" Accordingly, Abraham did as God had commanded, in bright daylight, bidding defiance to all, that none might say, \"Had we seen him attempt it, we should have prevented him.\" The circumcision was performed on the tenth day of Tishri, the Day of Atonement, and upon the spot on which the altar was later to be erected in the Temple, for the act of Abraham remains a never-ceasing atonement for Israel.",

      "title": "The Visit Of The Angels",
      "content": "On the third day after his circumcision, when Abraham was suffering dire pain, God spoke to the angels, saying, \"Go to, let us pay a visit to the sick.\" The angels refused, and said: \"What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that Thou visitest him? And Thou desirest to betake Thyself to a place of uncleanness, a place of blood and filth?\" But God replied unto them, \"Thus do ye speak. As ye live, the savor of this blood is sweeter to me than myrrh and incense, and if you do not desire to visit Abraham, I will go alone.\" The day whereon God visited him was exceedingly hot, for He had bored a hole in hell, so that its heat might reach as far as the earth, and no wayfarer venture abroad on the highways, and Abraham be left undisturbed in his pain. But the absence of strangers caused Abraham great vexation, and he sent his servant Eliezer forth to keep a lookout for travellers. When the servant returned from his fruitless search, Abraham himself, in spite of his illness and the scorching heat, prepared to go forth on the highway and see whether he would not succeed where failure had attended Eliezer, whom he did not wholly trust at any rate, bearing in mind the well-known saying, \"No truth among slaves.\" At this moment God appeared to him, surrounded by the angels. Quickly Abraham attempted to rise from his seat, but God checked every demonstration of respect, and when Abraham protested that it was unbecoming to sit in the presence of the Lord, God said, \"As thou livest, thy descendants at the age of four and five will sit in days to come in the schools and in the synagogues while I reside therein.\" Meantime Abraham beheld three men. They were the angels Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. They had assumed the form of human beings to fulfil his wish for guests toward whom to exercise hospitality. Each of them had been charged by God with a special mission, besides, to be executed on earth. Raphael was to heal the wound of Abraham, Michael was to bring Sarah the glad tidings that she would bear a son, and Gabriel was to deal destruction to Sodom and Gomorrah. Arrived at the tent of Abraham, the three angels noticed that he was occupied in nursing himself, and they withdrew. Abraham, however, hastened after them through another door of the tent, which had wide open entrances on all sides. He considered the duty of hospitality more important than the duty of receiving the Shekinah. Turning to God, he said, \"O Lord, may it please Thee not to leave Thy servant while he provides for the entertainment of his guests.\" Then he addressed himself to the stranger walking in the middle between the other two, whom by this token he considered the most distinguished,—it was the archangel Michael—and he bade him and his companions turn aside into his tent. The manner of his guests, who treated one another politely, made a good impression upon Abraham. He was assured that they were men of worth whom he was entertaining. But as they appeared outwardly like Arabs, and the people worshipped the dust of their feet, he bade them first wash their feet, that they might not defile his tent. He did not depend upon his own judgment in reading the character of his guests. By his tent a tree was planted, which spread its branches out over all who believed in God, and afforded them shade. But if idolaters went under the tree, the branches turned upward, and cast no shade upon the ground. Whenever Abraham saw this sign, he would at once set about the task of converting the worshippers of the false gods. And as the tree made a distinction between the pious and the impious, so also between the clean and the unclean. Its shade was denied them as long as they refrained from taking the prescribed ritual bath in the spring that flowed out from its roots, the waters of which rose at once for those whose uncleanness was of a venial character and could be removed forthwith, while others had to wait seven days for the water to come up. Accordingly, Abraham bade the three men lean against the trunk of the tree. Thus he would soon learn their worth or their unworthiness. Being of the truly pious, \"who promise little, but perform much,\" Abraham said only: \"I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your heart, seeing that ye chanced to pass my tent at dinner time. Then, after ye have given thanks to God, ye may pass on.\" But when the meal was served to the guests, it was a royal banquet, exceeding Solomon's at the time of his most splendid magnificence. Abraham himself ran unto the herd, to fetch cattle for meat. He slaughtered three calves, that he might be able to set a \"tongue with mustard\" before each of his guests. In order to accustom Ishmael to God-pleasing deeds, he had him dress the calves, and he bade Sarah bake the bread. But as he knew that women are apt to treat guests niggardly, he was explicit in his request to her. He said, \"Make ready quickly three measures of meal, yea, fine meal.\" As it happened, the bread was not brought to the table, because it had accidentally become unclean, and our father Abraham was accustomed to eat his daily bread only in a clean state. Abraham himself served his guests, and it appeared to him that the three men ate. But this was an illusion. In reality the angels did not eat, only Abraham, his three friends, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, and his son Ishmael partook of the banquet, and the portions set before the angels were devoured by a heavenly fire. Although the angels remained angels even in their human disguise, nevertheless the personality of Abraham was so exalted that in his presence the archangels felt insignificant. After the meal the angels asked after Sarah, though they knew that she was in retirement in her tent, but it was proper for them to pay their respects to the lady of the house and send her the cup of wine over which the blessing had been said. Michael, the greatest of the angels, thereupon announced the birth of Isaac. He drew a line upon the wall, saying, \"When the sun crosses this point, Sarah will be with child, and when he crosses the next point, she will give birth to a child.\" This communication, which was intended for Sarah and not for Abraham, to whom the promise had been revealed long before, the angels made at the entrance to her tent, but Ishmael stood between the angel and Sarah, for it would not have been seemly to deliver the message in secret, with none other by. Yet, so radiant was the beauty of Sarah that a beam of it struck the angel, and made him look up. In the act of turning toward her, he heard her laugh within herself: \"Is it possible that these bowels can yet bring forth a child, these shrivelled breasts give suck? And though I should be able to bear, yet is not my lord Abraham old?\" And the Lord said unto Abraham: \"Am I too old to do wonders? And wherefore doth Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?\" The reproach made by God was directed against Abraham as well as against Sarah, for he, too, had showed himself of little faith when he was told that a son would be born unto him. But God mentioned only Sarah's incredulity, leaving Abraham to become conscious of his defect himself. Regardful of the peace of their family life, God had not repeated Sarah's words accurately to Abraham. Abraham might have taken amiss what his wife had said about his advanced years, and so precious is the peace between husband and wife that even the Holy One, blessed be He, preserved it at the expense of truth. After Abraham had entertained his guests, he went with them to bring them on their way, for, important as the duty of hospitality is, the duty of speeding the parting guest is even more important. Their way lay in the direction of Sodom, whither two of the angels were going, the one to destroy it, and the second to save Lot, while the third, his errand to Abraham fulfilled, returned to heaven.",

      "title": "The Cities Of Sin",
      "content": "The inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah and the three other cities of the plain were sinful and godless. In their country there was an extensive vale, where they foregathered annually with their wives and their children and all belonging to them, to celebrate a feast lasting several days and consisting of the most revolting orgies. If a stranger merchant passed through their territory, he was besieged by them all, big and little alike, and robbed of whatever he possessed. Each one appropriated a bagatelle, until the traveller was stripped bare. If the victim ventured to remonstrate with one or another, he would show him that he had taken a mere trifle, not worth talking about. And the end was that they hounded him from the city. Once upon a time it happened that a man journeying from Elam arrived in Sodom toward evening. No one could be found to grant him shelter for the night. Finally a sly fox named Hedor invited him cordially to follow him to his house. The Sodomite had been attracted by a rarely magnificent carpet, strapped to the stranger's ass by means of a rope. He meant to secure it for himself. The friendly persuasions of Hedor induced the stranger to remain with him two days, though he had expected to stay only overnight. When the time came for him to continue on his journey, he asked his host for the carpet and the rope. Hedor said: \"Thou hast dreamed a dream, and this is the interpretation of thy dream: the rope signifies that thou wilt have a long life, as long as a rope; the varicolored carpet indicates that thou wilt own an orchard wherein thou wilt plant all sorts of fruit trees.\" The stranger insisted that his carpet was a reality, not a dream fancy, and he continued to demand its return. Not only did Hedor deny having taken anything from his guest, he even insisted upon pay for having interpreted his dream to him. His usual price for such services, he said, was four silver pieces, but in view of the fact that he was his guest, he would, as a favor to him, content himself with three pieces of silver. After much wrangling, they put their case before one of the judges of Sodom, Sherek by name, and he said to the plaintiff, \"Hedor is known in this city as a trustworthy interpreter of dreams, and what he tells thee is true.\" The stranger declared himself not satisfied with the verdict, and continued to urge his side of the case. Then Sherek drove both the plaintiff and the defendant from the court room. Seeing this, the inhabitants gathered together and chased the stranger from the city, and lamenting the loss of his carpet, he had to pursue his way. As Sodom had a judge worthy of itself, so also had the other cities—Sharkar in Gomorrah, Zabnak in Admah, and Manon in Zeboiim. Eliezer, the bondman of Abraham, made slight changes in the names of these judges, in accordance with the nature of what they did: the first he called Shakkara, Liar; the second Shakrura, Arch-deceiver; the third Kazban, Falsifier; and the fourth, Mazle-Din, Perverter of Judgment. At the suggestion of these judges, the cities set up beds on their commons. When a stranger arrived, three men seized him by his head, and three by his feet, and they forced him upon one of the beds. If he was too short to fit into it exactly, his six attendants pulled and wrenched his limbs until he filled it out; if he was too long for; it, they tried to jam him in with all their combined strength, until the victim was on the verge of death. Hit outcrles were met with the words, \"Thus will be done to any man that comes into our land.\" After a while travellers avoided these cities, but if some poor devil was betrayed occasionally into entering them, they would give him gold and silver, but never any bread, so that he was bound to die of starvation. Once he was dead, the residents of the city came and took back the marked gold and silver which they had given him, and they would quarrel about the distribution of his clothes, for they would bury him naked. Once Eliezer, the bondman of Abraham, went to Sodom, at the bidding of Sarah, to inquire after the welfare of Lot. He happened to enter the city at the moment when the people were robbing a stranger of his garments. Eliezer espoused the cause of the poor wretch, and the Sodomites turned against him; one threw a stone at his forehead and caused considerable loss of blood. Instantly, the assailant, seeing the blood gush forth, demanded payment for having performed the operation of cupping. Eliezer refused to pay for the infliction of a wound upon him, and he was haled before the judge Shakkara. The decision went against him, for the law of the land gave the assailant the right to demand payment. Eliezer quickly picked up a stone and threw it at the judge's forehead. When he saw that the blood was flowing profusely, he said to the judge, \"Pay my debt to the man and give me the balance.\" The cause of their cruelty was their exceeding great wealth. Their soil was gold, and in their miserliness and their greed for more and more gold, they wanted to prevent strangers from enjoying aught of their riches. Accordingly, they flooded the highways with streams of water, so that the roads to their city were obliterated, and none could find the way thither. They were as heartless toward beasts as toward men. They begrudged the birds what they ate, and therefore extirpated them. They behaved impiously toward one another, too, not shrinking back from murder to gain possession of more gold. If they observed that a man owned great riches, two of them would conspire against him. They would beguile him to the vicinity of ruins, and while the one kept him on the spot by pleasant converse, the other would undermine the wall near which he stood, until it suddenly crashed down upon him and killed him. Then the two plotters would divide his wealth between them. Another method of enriching themselves with the property of others was in vogue among them. They were adroit thieves. When they made up their minds to commit theft, they would first ask their victim to take care of a sum of money for them, which they smeared with strongly scented oil before handing it over to him. The following night they would break into his house, and rob him of his secret treasures, led to the place of concealment by the smell of the oil. Their laws were calculated to do injury to the poor. The richer a man, the more was he favored before the law. The owner of two oxen was obliged to render one day's shepherd service, but if he had but one ox, he had to give two days' service. A poor orphan, who was thus forced to tend the flocks a longer time than those who were blessed with large herds, killed all the cattle entrusted to him in order to take revenge upon his oppressors, and he insisted, when the skins were assigned, that the owner of two head of cattle should have but one skin, but the owner of one head should receive two skins, in correspondence to the method pursued in assigning the work. For the use of the ferry, a traveller had to pay four zuz, but if he waded through the water, he had to pay eight zuz. The cruelty of the Sodomites went still further. Lot had a daughter, Paltit, so named because she had been born to him shortly after he escaped captivity through the help of Abraham. Paltit lived in Sodom, where she had married. Once a beggar came to town, and the court issued a proclamation that none should give him anything to eat, in order that he might die of starvation. But Paltit had pity upon the unfortunate wretch, and every day when she went to the well to draw water, she supplied him with a piece of bread, which she hid in her water pitcher. The inhabitants of the two sinful cities, Sodom and Gomorrah, could not understand why the beggar did not perish, and they suspected that some one was giving him food in secret. Three men concealed themselves near the beggar, and caught Paltit in the act of giving him something to eat. She had to pay for her humanity with death; she was burnt upon a pyre. The people of Admah were no better than those of Sodom. Once a stranger came to Admah, intending to stay overnight and continue his journey the next morning. The daughter of a rich man met the stranger, and gave him water to drink and bread to eat at his request. When the people of Admah heard of this infraction of the law of the land, they seized the girl and arraigned her before the judge, who condemned her to death. The people smeared her with honey from top to toe, and exposed her where bees would be attracted to her. The insects stung her to death, and the callous people paid no heed to her heartrending cries. Then it was that God resolved upon the destruction of these sinners.",

      "content": "When God saw that there was no righteous man among the inhabitants of the sinful cities, and there would be none among their descendants, for the sake of whose merits the rest might be treated with lenient consideration, He resolved to annihilate them one and all. But before judgment was executed, the Lord made known unto Abraham what He would do to Sodom, Gomorrah, and the other cities of the plain, for they formed a part of Canaan, the land promised unto Abraham, and therefore did God say, \"I will not destroy them without the consent of Abraham.\" Like a compassionate father, Abraham importuned the grace of God in behalf of the sinners. He spoke to God, and said: \"Thou didst take an oath that no more should all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood. Is it meet that Thou shouldst evade Thy oath and destroy cities by fire? Shall the Judge of all the earth not do right Himself? Verily, if Thou desirest to maintain the world, Thou must give up the strict line of justice. If Thou insistest upon the right alone, there can be no world.\" Whereupon God said to Abraham: \"Thou takest delight in defending My creatures, and thou wouldst not call them guilty. Therefore I spoke with none but thee during the ten generations since Noah.\" Abraham ventured to use still stronger words in order to secure the safety of the godless. \"That be far from Thee,\" he said, \"to slay the righteous with the wicked, that the dwellers on the earth say not, 'It is His trade to destroy the generations of men in a cruel manner; for He destroyed the generation of Enosh, then the generation of the flood, and then He sent the confusion of tongues. He sticks ever to His trade.'\" God made reply: \"I will let all the generations I have destroyed pass before thee, that thou mayest see they have not suffered the extreme punishment they deserved. But if thou thinkest that I did not act justly, then instruct thou Me in what I must do, and I will endeavor to act in accordance with thy words.\" And Abraham had to admit that God had not diminished in aught the justice due to every creature in this world or the other world. Nevertheless he continued to speak, and he said: \"Wilt Thou consume the cities, if there be ten righteous men in each?\" And God said, \"No, if I find fifty righteous therein, I will not destroy the cities.\" Abraham: \"I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, I who would have been turned long since into dust of the ground by Amraphel and into ashes by Nimrod, had it not been for Thy grace. Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous for Zoar, the smallest of the five cities. Wilt Thou destroy all the city for lack of five?\" God: \"I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.\" Abraham: \"Peradventure there be ten pious in each of the four cities, then forgive Zoar in Thy grace, for its sins are not so great in number as the sins of the others.\" God granted his petition, yet Abraham continued to plead, and he asked whether God would not be satisfied if there were but thirty righteous, ten in each of the three larger cities, and would pardon the two smaller ones, even though there were no righteous therein, whose merits would intercede for them. This, too, the Lord granted, and furthermore He promised not to destroy the cities if but twenty righteous were found therein; yes, God conceded that He would preserve the five cities for the sake of ten righteous therein. More than this Abraham did not ask, for he knew that eight righteous ones, Noah and his wife, and his three sons and their wives, had not sufficed to avert the doom of the generation of the flood, and furthermore he hoped that Lot, his wife, and their four daughters, together with the husbands of their daughters, would make up the number ten. What he did not know was that even the righteous in these sin-laden cities, though better than the rest, were far from good. Abraham did not cease to pray for the deliverance of the sinners even after the Shekinah had removed from him. But his supplications and his intercessions were in vain. For fifty-two years God had warned the godless; He had made mountains to quake and tremble. But they hearkened not unto the voice of admonition. They persisted in their sins, and their well-merited punishment overtook them. God forgives all sins, only not an immoral life. And as all these sinners led a life of debauchery, they were burnt with fire.",

      "content": "The angels left Abraham at noon time, and they reached Sodom at the approach of evening. As a rule, angels proclaim their errand with the swiftness of lightning, but these were angels of mercy, and they hesitated to execute their work of destruction, ever hoping that the evil would be turned aside from Sodom. With nightfall, the fate of Sodom was sealed irrevocably, and the angels arrived there. Bred in the house of Abraham, Lot had learnt from him the beautiful custom of extending hospitality, and when he saw the angels before him in human form, thinking they were wayfarers, he bade them turn aside and tarry all night in his house. But as the entertainment of strangers was forbidden in Sodom on penalty of death, he dared invite them only under cover of the darkness of night, and even then he had to use every manner of precaution, bidding the angels to follow him by devious ways. The angels, who had accepted Abraham's hospitality without delay, first refused to comply with Lot's request, for it is a rule of good breeding to show reluctance when an ordinary man invites one, but to accept the invitation of a great man at once. Lot, however, was insistent, and carried them into his house by main force. At home he had to overcome the opposition of his wife, for she said, \"If the inhabitants of Sodom hear of this, they will slay thee.\" Lot divided his dwelling in two parts, one for himself and his guests, the other for his wife, so that, if aught happened, his wife would be spared. Nevertheless it was she who betrayed him. She went to a neighbor and borrowed some salt, and to the question, whether she could not have supplied herself with salt during daylight hours, she replied, \"We had enough salt, until some guests came to us; for them we needed more.\" In this way the presence of strangers was bruited abroad in the city. In the beginning the angels were inclined to hearken to the petition of Lot in behalf of the sinners, but when all the people of the city, big and little, crowded around the house of Lot with the purpose of committing a monstrous crime, the angels warded off his prayers, saying, \"Hitherto thou couldst intercede for them, but now no longer.\" It was not the first time that the inhabitants of Sodom wanted to perpetrate a crime of this sort. They had made a law some time before that all strangers were to be treated in this horrible way. Lot, who was appointed chief judge on the very day of the angels' coming, tried to induce the people to desist from their purpose, saying to them, \"My brethren, the generation of the deluge was extirpated in consequence of such sins as you desire to commit, and you would revert to them?\" But they replied: \"Back! And though Abraham himself came hither, we should have no consideration for him. Is it possible that thou wouldst set aside a law which thy predecessors administered?\" Even Lot's moral sense was no better than it should have been. It is the duty of a man to venture his life for the honor of his wife and his daughters, but Lot was ready to sacrifice the honor of his daughters, wherefor he was punished severely later on. The angels told Lot who they were, and what the mission that had brought them to Sodom, and they charged him to flee from the city with his wife and his four daughters, two of them married, and two betrothed. Lot communicated their bidding to his sons-in-law, and they mocked at him, and said: \"O thou fool! Violins, cymbals, and flutes resound in the city, and thou sayest Sodom will be destroyed!\" Such scoffing but hastened the execution of the doom of Sodom. The angel Michael laid hold upon the hand of Lot, and his wife and his daughters, while with his little finger the angel Gabriel touched the rock whereon the sinful cities were built, and overturned them. At the same time the rain that was streaming down upon the two cities was changed into brimstone. When the angels had brought forth Lot and his family and set them without the city, he bade them run for their lives, and not look behind, lest they behold the Shekinah, which had descended to work the destruction of the cities. The wife of Lot could not control herself. Her mother love made her look behind to see if her married daughters were following. She beheld the Shekinah, and she became a pillar of salt. This pillar exists unto this day. The cattle lick it all day long, and in the evening it seems to have disappeared, but when morning comes it stands there as large as before. The savior angel had urged Lot himself to take refuge with Abraham. But he refused, and said: \"As long as I dwelt apart from Abraham, God compared my deeds with the deeds of my fellow-citizens, and among them I appeared as a righteous man. If I should return to Abraham, God will see that his good deeds outweigh mine by far.\" The angel then granted his plea that Zoar be left undestroyed. This city had been founded a year later than the other four; it was only fifty-one years old, and therefore the measure of its sins was not so full as the measure of the sins of the neighboring cities. The destruction of the cities of the plain took place at dawn of the sixteenth day of Nisan, for the reason that there were moon and sun worshippers among the inhabitants. God said: \"If I destroy them by day, the moon worshippers will say, Were the moon here, she would prove herself our savior; and if I destroy them by night, the sun worshippers will say, Were the sun here, he would prove himself our savior. I will therefore let their chastisement overtake them on the sixteenth day of Nisan at an hour at which the moon and the sun are both in the skies.\" The sinful inhabitants of the cities of the plain not only lost their life in this world, but also their share in the future world. As for the cities themselves, however, they will be restored in the Messianic time. The destruction of Sodom happened at the time at which Abraham was performing his morning devotions, and for his sake it was established as the proper hour for the morning prayer unto all times. When he turned his eyes toward Sodom and beheld the rising smoke, he prayed for the deliverance of Lot, and God granted his petition—the fourth time that Lot became deeply indebted to Abraham. Abraham had taken him with him to Palestine, he had made him rich in flocks, herds, and tents, he had rescued him from captivity, and by his prayer he saved him from the destruction of Sodom. The descendants of Lot, the Ammonites and the Moabites, instead of showing gratitude to the Israelites, the posterity of Abraham, committed four acts of hostility against them. They sought to compass the destruction of Israel by means of Balaam's curses, they waged open war against him at the time of Jephthah, and also at the time of Jehoshaphat, and finally they manifested their hatred against Israel at the destruction of the Temple. Hence it is that God appointed four prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Zephaniah, to proclaim punishment unto the descendants of Lot, and four times their sin is recorded in Holy Writ. Though Lot owed his deliverance to the petition of Abraham, yet it was at the same time his reward for not having betrayed Abraham in Egypt, when he pretended to be the brother of Sarah. But a greater reward still awaits him. The Messiah will be a descendant of his, for the Moabitess Ruth is the great-grandmother of David, and the Ammonitess Naamah is the mother of Rehoboam, and the Messiah is of the line of these two kings.",

      "content": "The destruction of Sodom induced Abraham to journey to Gerar. Accustomed to extend hospitality to travellers and wayfarers, he no longer felt comfortable in a district in which all traffic had ceased by reason of the ruined cities. There was another reason for Abraham's leaving his place; the people spoke too much about the ugly incident with Lot's daughters. Arrived in the land of the Philistines, he again, as aforetime in Egypt, came to an understanding with Sarah, that she was to call herself his sister. When the report of her beauty reached the king, he ordered her to be brought before him, and he asked her who her companion was, and she told him that Abraham was her brother. Entranced by her beauty, Abimelech the king took Sarah to wife, and heaped marks of honor upon Abraham in accordance with the just claims of a brother of the queen. Toward evening, before retiring, while he was still seated upon his throne, Abimelech fell into a sleep, and he slept until the morning, and in the dream he dreamed he saw an angel of the Lord raising his sword to deal him a death blow. Sore frightened, he asked the cause, and the angel replied, and said: \"Thou wilt die on account of the woman thou didst take into thy house this day, for she is the wife of Abraham, the man whom thou didst cite before thee. Return his wife unto him! But if thou restore her not, thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are thine.\" In that night the voice of a great crying was heard in the whole land of the Philistines, for they saw the figure of a man walking about, with sword in hand, slaying all that came in his way. At the same time it happened that in men and beasts alike all the apertures of the body closed up, and the land was seized with indescribable excitement. In the morning, when the king awoke, in agony and terror, he called all his servants and told his dream in their ears. One of their number said: \"O lord and king! Restore this woman unto the man, for he is her husband. It is but his way in a strange land to pretend that she is his sister. Thus did he with the king of Egypt, too, and God sent heavy afflictions upon Pharaoh when he took the woman unto himself. Consider, also, O lord and king, what hath befallen this night in the land; great pain, wailing, and confusion there was, and we know that it came upon us only because of this woman.\" There were some among his servants who spake: \"Be not afraid of dreams! What dreams make known to man is but falsehood.\" Then God appeared unto Abimelech again and commanded him to let Sarah go free, otherwise he would be a dead man. Abimelech replied: \"Is this Thy way? Then, I ween, the generation of the flood and the generation of the confusion of tongues were innocent, too! The man himself did say unto me, She is my sister, and she, even she herself said, He is my brother, and all the people of their household said the same words.\" And God said unto him: \"Yea, I know that thou hast not yet committed a trespass, for I withheld thee from sinning. Thou didst not know that Sarah was a man's wife. But is it becoming to question a stranger, no sooner does he set foot upon thy territory, about the woman accompanying him, whether she be his wife or his sister? Abraham, who is a prophet, knew beforehand the danger to himself if he revealed the whole truth. But, being a prophet, he also knows that thou didst not touch his wife, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live.\" The smoke was still rising from the ruins of Sodom, and Abimelech and his people, seeing it, feared that a like fate might overtake them. The king called Abraham and reproached him for having caused such great misfortune through his false statements concerning Sarah. Abraham excused his conduct by his apprehension that, the fear of God not being in the place, the inhabitants of the land slay him for his wife. Abraham went on and told the history of his whole life, and he said: \"When I dwelt in the house of my father, the nations of the world sought to do me harm, but God proved Himself my Redeemer. When the nations of the world tried to lead me astray to idolatry, God revealed Himself to me, and He said, 'Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house.' And when the nations of the world were about to go astray, God sent two prophets, my kinsmen Shem and Eber, to admonish them.\" Abimelech gave rich gifts to Abraham, wherein he acted otherwise than Pharaoh in similar circumstances. The Egyptian king gave gifts to Sarah, but Abimelech was God fearing, and desired that Abraham pray for him. To Sarah he gave a costly robe that covered her whole person, hiding her seductive charms from the view of beholders. At the same time it was a reproach to Abraham, that he had not fitted Sarah out with the splendor due to his wife. Though Abimelech had done him great injury, Abraham not only granted him the forgiveness he craved, but also he prayed for him to God. Thus he is an exemplar unto all. \"Man should be pliant as a reed, not hard like the cedar.\" He should be easily appeased, and slow to anger, and as soon as he who has sinned against him asks for pardon, he should forgive him with all his heart. Even if deep and serious injury has been done to him, he should not be vengeful, nor bear his brother a grudge in his heart. Abraham prayed thus for Abimelech: \"O Lord of the world! Thou hast created man that he may increase and propagate his kind. Grant that Abimelech and his house may multiply and increase!\" God fulfilled Abraham's petition in behalf of Abimelech and his people, and it was the first time it happened in the history of mankind that God fulfilled the prayer of one human being for the benefit of another. Abimelech and his subjects were healed of all their diseases, and so efficacious was the prayer offered by Abraham that the wife of Abimelech, barren hitherto, bore a child.",

      "content": "When the prayer of Abraham for Abimelech was heard, and the king of the Philistines recovered, the angels raised a loud cry, and spoke to God thus: \"O Lord of the world! All these years hath Sarah been barren, as the wife of Abimelech was. Now Abraham prayed to Thee, and the wife of Abimelech hath been granted a child. It is just and fair that Sarah should be remembered and granted a child.\" These words of the angels, spoken on the New Year's Day, when the fortunes of men are determined in heaven for the whole year, bore a result. Barely seven months later, on the first day of the Passover, Isaac was born. The birth of Isaac was a happy event, and not in the house of Abraham alone. The whole world rejoiced, for God remembered all barren women at the same time with Sarah. They all bore children. And all the blind were made to see, all the lame were made whole, the dumb were made to speak, and the mad were restored to reason. And a still greater miracle happened: on the day of Isaac's birth the sun shone with such splendor as had not been seen since the fall of man, and as he will shine again only in the future world. To silence those who asked significantly, \"Can one a hundred years old beget a son?\" God commanded the angel who has charge over the embryos, to give them form and shape, that he fashion Isaac precisely according to the model of Abraham, so that all seeing Isaac might exclaim, \"Abraham begot Isaac.\" That Abraham and Sarah were blessed with offspring only after they had attained so great an age, had an important reason. It was necessary that Abraham should bear the sign of the covenant upon his body before he begot the son who was appointed to be the father of Israel. And as Isaac was the first child born to Abraham after he was marked with the sign, he did not fail to celebrate his circumcision with much pomp and ceremony on the eighth day. Shem, Eber, Abimelech king of the Philistines, and his whole retinue, Phicol the captain of his host in it—they all were present, and also Terah and his son Nahor, in a word, all the great ones round about. On this occasion Abraham could at last put a stop to the talk of the people, who said, \"Look at this old couple! They picked up a foundling on the highway, and they pretend he is their own son, and to make their statement seem credible, they arrange a feast in his honor.\" Abraham had invited not only men to the celebration, but also the wives of the magnates with their infants, and God permitted a miracle to be done. Sarah had enough milk in her breasts to suckle all the babes there, and they who drew from her breasts had much to thank her for. Those whose mothers had harbored only pious thoughts in their minds when they let them drink the milk that flowed from the breasts of the pious Sarah, they became proselytes when they grew up; and those whose mothers let Sarah nurse them only in order to test her, they grew up to be powerful rulers, losing their dominion only at the revelation on Mount Sinai, because they would not accept the Torah. All proselytes and pious heathen are the descendants of these infants. Among the guests of Abraham were the thirty-one kings and thirty-one viceroys of Palestine who were vanquished by Joshua at the conquest of the Holy Land. Even Og king of Bashan was present, and he had to suffer the teasing of the other guests, who rallied him upon having called Abraham a sterile mule, who would never have offspring. Og, on his part, pointed at the little boy with contempt, and said, \"Were I to lay my finger upon him, he would be crushed.\" Whereupon God said to him: \"Thou makest mock of the gift given to Abraham! As thou livest, thou shalt look upon millions and myriads of his descendants, and in the end thou shalt fall into their hands.\"",

      "content": "When Isaac grew up, quarrels broke out between him and Ishmael, on account of the rights of the first-born. Ishmael insisted he should receive a double portion of the inheritance after the death of Abraham, and Isaac should receive only one portion. Ishmael, who had been accustomed from his youth to use the bow and arrow, was in the habit of aiming his missiles in the direction of Isaac, saying at the same time that he was but jesting. Sarah, however, insisted that Abraham make over to Isaac all he owned, that no disputes might arise after his death, \"for,\" she said, \"Ishmael is not worthy of being heir with my son, nor with a man like Isaac, and certainly not with my son Isaac.\" Furthermore, Sarah insisted that Abraham divorce himself from Hagar, the mother of Ishmael, and send away the woman and her son, so that there be naught in common between them and her own son, either in this world or in the future world. Of all the trials Abraham had to undergo, none was so hard to bear as this, for it grieved him sorely to separate himself from his son. God appeared to him in the following night, and said to him: \"Abraham, knowest thou not that Sarah was appointed to be thy wife from her mother's womb? She is thy companion and the wife of thy youth, and I named not Hagar as thy wife, nor Sarah as thy bondwoman. What Sarah spoke unto thee was naught but truth, and let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman.\" The next morning Abraham rose up early, gave Hagar her bill of divorcement, and sent her away with her son, first binding a rope about her loins that all might see she was a bondwoman. The evil glance cast upon her stepson by Sarah made him sick and feverish, so that Hagar had to carry him, grown-up as he was. In his fever he drank often of the water in the bottle given her by Abraham as she left his house, and the water was quickly spent. That she might not look upon the death of her child, Hagar cast Ishmael under the willow shrubs growing on the selfsame spot whereon the angels had once spoken with her and made known to her that she would bear a son. In the bitterness of her heart, she spoke to God, and said, \"Yesterday Thou didst say to me, I will greatly multiply thy seed, that it shall not be numbered for multitude, and to-day my son dies of thirst.\" Ishmael himself cried unto God, and his prayer and the merits of Abraham brought them help in their need, though the angels appeared against Ishmael before God. They said, \"Wilt Thou cause a well of water to spring up for him whose descendants will let Thy children of Israel perish with thirst?\" But God replied, and said, \"What is Ishmael at this moment—righteous or wicked?\" and when the angels called him righteous, God continued, \"I treat man according to his deserts at each moment.\" At that moment Ishmael was pious indeed, for he was praying to God in the following words: \"O Lord of the world! If it be Thy will that I shall perish, then let me die in some other way, not by thirst, for the tortures of thirst are great beyond all others.\" Hagar, instead of praying to God, addressed her supplications to the idols of her youth. The prayer of Ishmael was acceptable before God, and He bade Miriam's well spring up, the well created in the twilight of the sixth day of creation. Even after this miracle Hagar's faith was no stronger than before. She filled the bottle with water, because she feared it might again be spent, and no other would be nigh. Thereupon she journeyed to Egypt with her son, for \"Throw the stick into the air as thou wilt, it will always land on its point.\" Hagar had come from Egypt, and to Egypt she returned, to choose a wife for her son.",

      "content": "The wife of Ishmael bore four sons and a daughter, and afterward Ishmael, his mother, and his wife and children went and returned to the wilderness. They made themselves tents in the wilderness in which they dwelt, and they continued to encamp and journey, month by month and year by year. And God gave Ishmael flocks, and herds, and tents, on account of Abraham his father, and the man increased in cattle. And some time after, Abraham said to Sarah, his wife, \"I will go and see my son Ishmael; I yearn to look upon him, for I have not seen him for a long time.\" And Abraham rode upon one of his camels to the wilderness, to seek his son Ishmael, for he heard that he was dwelling in a tent in the wilderness with all belonging to him. And Abraham went to the wilderness, and he reached the tent of Ishmael about noon, and he asked after him. He found the wife of Ishmael sitting in the tent with her children, and her husband and his mother were not with them. And Abraham asked the wife of Ishmael, saying, \"Where has Ishmael gone?\" And she said, \"He has gone to the field to hunt game.\" And Abraham was still mounted upon the camel, for he would not alight upon the ground, as he had sworn to his wife Sarah that he would not get off from the camel. And Abraham said to Ishmael's wife, \"My daughter, give me a little water, that I may drink, for I am fatigued and tired from the journey.\" And Ishmael's wife answered, and said to Abraham, \"We have neither water nor bread,\" and she was sitting in the tent, and did not take any notice of Abraham. She did not even ask him who he was. But all the while she was beating her children in the tent, and she was cursing them, and she also cursed her husband Ishmael, and spoke evil of him, and Abraham heard the words of Ishmael's wife to her children, and it was an evil thing in his eyes. And Abraham called to the woman to come out to him from the tent, and the woman came out, and stood face to face with Abraham, while Abraham was still mounted upon the camel. And Abraham said to Ishmael's wife, \"When thy husband Ishmael returns home, say these words to him: A very old man from the land of the Philistines came hither to seek thee, and his appearance was thus and so, and thus was his figure. I did not ask him who he was, and seeing thou wast not here, he spoke unto me, and said, When Ishmael thy husband returns, tell him, Thus did the man say, When thou comest home, put away this tent-pin which thou hast placed here, and place another tent-pin in its stead.\" And Abraham finished his instructions to the woman, and he turned and went off on the camel homeward. And when Ishmael returned to the tent, he heard the words of his wife, and he knew that it was his father, and that his wife had not honored him. And Ishmael understood his father's words that he had spoken to his wife, and he hearkened to the voice of his father, and he divorced his wife, and she went away. And Ishmael afterward went to the land of Canaan, and he took another wife, and he brought her to his tent, to the place where he dwelt. And at the end of three years, Abraham said, \"I will go again and see Ishmael my son, for I have not seen him for a long time.\" And he rode upon his camel, and went to the wilderness, and he reached the tent of Ishmael about noon. And he asked after Ishmael, and his wife came out of the tent, and she said, \"He is not here, my lord, for he has gone to hunt in the fields and feed the camels,\" and the woman said to Abraham, \"Turn in, my lord, into the tent, and eat a morsel of bread, for thy soul must be wearied on account of the journey.\" And Abraham said to her, \"I will not stop, for I am in haste to continue my journey, but give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty,\" and the woman hastened and ran into the tent, and she brought out water and bread to Abraham, which she placed before him, urging him to eat and drink, and he ate and drank, and his heart was merry, and he blessed his son Ishmael. And he finished his meal, and he blessed the Lord, and he said to Ishmael's wife: \"When Ishmael comes home, say these words to him: A very old man from the land of the Philistines came hither, and asked after thee, and thou wast not here, and I brought him out bread and water, and he ate and drank, and his heart was merry. And he spoke these words to me, When Ishmael thy husband comes home, say unto him, The tent-pin which thou hast is very good, do not put it away from the tent.\" And Abraham finished commanding the woman, and he rode off to his home, to the land of the Philistines, and when Ishmael came to his tent, his wife went forth to meet him with joy and a cheerful heart, and she told him the words of the old man. Ishmael knew that it was his father, and that his wife had honored him, and he praised the Lord. And Ishmael then took his wife and his children and his cattle and all belonging to him, and he journeyed from there, and he went to his father in the land of the Philistines. And Abraham related to Ishmael all that had happened between him and the first wife that Ishmael had taken, according to what she had done. And Ishmael and his children dwelt with Abraham many days in that land, and Abraham dwelt in the land of the Philistines a long time.",

      "title": "The Covenant With Abimelech",
      "content": "After a sojourn of twenty-six years in the land of the Philistines, Abraham departed thence, and he settled in the neighborhood of Hebron. There he was visited by Abimelech with twenty of his grandees, who requested him to make an alliance with the Philistines. As long as Abraham was childless, the heathen did not believe in his piety, but when Isaac was born, they said to him, \"God is with thee.\" But again they entertained doubt of his piety when he cast off Ishmael. They said, \"Were he a righteous man, he would not drive his first-born forth from his house.\" But when they observed the impious deeds of Ishmael, they said, \"God is with thee in all thou doest.\" That Abraham was the favorite of God, they saw in this, too, that although Sodom was destroyed and all traffic had come to a standstill in that region, yet Abraham's treasure chambers were filled. For these reasons, the Philistines sought to form an alliance with him, to remain in force for three generations to come, for it is to the third generation that the love of a father extends. Before Abraham concluded the covenant with Abimelech, king of the Philistines, he reproved him on account of a well, for \"Correction leads to love,\" and \"There is no peace without correction.\" The herdmen of Abraham and those of Abimelech had left their dispute about the well to decision by ordeal: the well was to belong to the party for whose sheep the waters would rise so that they could drink of them. But the shepherds of Abimelech disregarded the agreement, and they wrested the well for their own use. As a witness and a perpetual sign that the well belonged to him, Abraham set aside seven sheep, corresponding to the seven Noachian laws binding upon all men alike. But God said, \"Thou didst give him seven sheep. As thou livest, the Philistines shall one day slay seven righteous men, Samson, Hophni, Phinehas, and Saul with his three sons, and they will destroy seven holy places, and they will keep the holy Ark in their country as booty of war for a period of seven months, and furthermore only the seventh generation of thy descendants will be able to rejoice in the possession of the land promised to them.\" After concluding the alliance with Abimelech, who acknowledged Abraham's right upon the well, Abraham called the place Beer-sheba, because there they swore both of them unto a covenant of friendship. In Beer-sheba Abraham dwelt many years, and thence he endeavored to spread the law of God. He planted a large grove there, and he made four gates for it, facing the four sides of the earth, east, west, north, and south, and he planted a vineyard therein. If a traveller came that way, he entered by the gate that faced him, and he sat in the grove, and ate, and drank, until he was satisfied, and then he departed. For the house of Abraham was always open for all passers-by, and they came daily to eat and drink there. If one was hungry, and he came to Abraham, he would give him what he needed, so that he might eat and drink and be satisfied; and if one was naked, and he came to Abraham, he would clothe him with the garments of the poor man's choice, and give him silver and gold, and make known to him the Lord, who had created him and set him on earth. After the wayfarers had eaten, they were in the habit of thanking Abraham for his kind entertainment of them, whereto he would reply: \"What, ye give thanks unto me! Rather return thanks to your host, He who alone provides food and drink for all creatures.\" Then the people would ask, \"Where is He?\" and Abraham would answer them, and say: \"He is the Ruler of heaven and earth. He woundeth and He healeth, He formeth the embryo in the womb of the mother and bringeth it forth into the world, He causeth the plants and the trees to grow, He killeth and He maketh alive, He bringeth down to Sheol and bringeth up.\" When the people heard such words, they would ask, \"How shall we return thanks to God and manifest our gratitude unto Him?\" And Abraham would instruct them in these words: \"Say, Blessed be the Lord who is blessed! Blessed be He that giveth bread and food unto all flesh!\" In this manner did Abraham teach those who had enjoyed his hospitality how to praise and thank God. Abraham's house thus became not only a lodging-place for the hungry and thirsty, but also a place of instruction where the knowledge of God and His law were taught.",

      "content": "In spite of the lavish hospitality practiced in the house of Abraham, it happened once that a poor man, or rather an alleged poor man, was turned away empty-handed, and this was the immediate reason for the last of Abraham's temptations, the sacrifice of his favorite son Isaac. It was the day on which Abraham celebrated the birth of Isaac with a great banquet, to which all the magnates of the time were bidden with their wives. Satan, who always appears at a feast in which no poor people participate, and keeps aloof from those to which poor guests are invited, turned up at Abraham's banquet in the guise of a beggar asking alms at the door. He had noticed that Abraham had invited no poor man, and he knew that his house was the right place for him. Abraham was occupied with the entertainment of his distinguished guests, and Sarah was endeavoring to convince their wives, the matrons, that Isaac was her child in very truth, and not a spurious child. No one concerned himself about the beggar at the door, who thereupon accused Abraham before God. Now, there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them. And the Lord said unto Satan, \"From whence comest thou?\" and Satan answered the Lord, and said, \"From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down in it.\" And the Lord said unto Satan, \"What hast thou to say concerning all the children of the earth?\" and Satan answered the Lord, and said: \"I have seen all the children of the earth serving Thee and remembering Thee, when they require aught from Thee. And when Thou givest them what they require from Thee, then they forsake Thee, and they remember Thee no more. Hast Thou seen Abraham, the son of Terah, who at first had no children, and he served Thee and erected altars to Thee wherever he came, and he brought offerings upon them, and he proclaimed Thy name continually to all the children of the earth? And now his son Isaac is born to him, he has forsaken Thee. He made a great feast for all the inhabitants of the land, and the Lord he has forgotten. For amidst all that he has done, he brought Thee no offering, neither burnt offering nor peace offering, neither one lamb nor goat of all that he had killed in the day that his son was weaned. Even from the time of his son's birth till now, being thirty-seven years, he built no altar before Thee, nor brought up any offering to Thee, for he saw that Thou didst give what he requested before Thee, and he therefore forsook Thee.\" And the Lord said to Satan: \"Hast thou considered My servant Abraham? For there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man before Me for a burnt offering, and that feareth God and escheweth evil. As I live, were I to say unto him, Bring up Isaac thy son before Me, he would not withhold him from Me, much less if I told him to bring up a burnt offering before Me from his flocks or herds.\" And Satan answered the Lord, and said, \"Speak now unto Abraham as Thou hast said, and Thou wilt see whether he will not transgress and cast aside Thy words this day.\" God wished to try Isaac also. Ishmael once boasted to Isaac, saying, \"I was thirteen years old when the Lord spoke to my father to circumcise us, and I did not transgress His word, which He commanded my father.\" And Isaac answered Ishmael, saying, \"What dost thou boast to me about this, about a little bit of thy flesh which thou didst take from thy body, concerning which the Lord commanded thee? As the Lord liveth, the God of my father Abraham, if the Lord should say unto my father, Take now thy son Isaac and bring him up as an offering before Me, I would not refrain, but I would joyfully accede to it.\"",

      "content": "And the Lord thought to try Abraham and Isaac in this matter. And He said to Abraham, \"Take now thy son.\" Abraham: \"I have two sons, and I do not know which of them Thou commandest me to take.\" God: \"Thine only son.\" Abraham: \"The one is the only son of his mother, and the other is the only son of his mother.\" God: \"Whom thou lovest.\" Abraham: \"I love this one and I love that one.\" God: \"Even Isaac.\" Abraham: \"And where shall I go?\" God: \"To the land I will show thee, and offer Isaac there for a burnt offering.\" Abraham: \"Am I fit to perform the sacrifice, am I a priest? Ought not rather the high priest Shem to do it?\" God: \"When thou wilt arrive at that place, I will consecrate thee and make thee a priest.\" And Abraham said within himself, \"How shall I separate my son Isaac from Sarah his mother?\" And he came into the tent, and he sate before Sarah his wife, and he spake these words to her: \"My son Isaac is grown up, and he has not yet studied the service of God. Now, to-morrow I will go and bring him to Shem and Eber his son, and there he will learn the ways of the Lord, for they will teach him to know the Lord, and to know how to pray unto the Lord that He may answer him, and to know the way of serving the Lord his God.\" And Sarah said, \"Thou hast spoken well. Go, my lord, and do unto him as thou hast said, but remove him not far from me, neither let him remain there too long, for my soul is bound within his soul.\" And Abraham said unto Sarah, \"My daughter, let us pray to the Lord our God that He may do good with us.\" And Sarah took her son Isaac, and he abode with her all that night, and she kissed and embraced him, and she laid injunctions upon him till morning, and she said to Abraham: \"O my lord, I pray thee, take heed of thy son, and place thine eyes over him, for I have no other son nor daughter but him. O neglect him not. If he be hungry, give him bread, and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink; do not let him go on foot, neither let him sit in the sun, neither let him go by himself on the road, neither turn him from whatever he may desire, but do unto him as he may say to thee.\" After spending the whole night in weeping on account of Isaac, she got up in the morning and selected a very fine and beautiful garment from those that Abimelech had given to her. And she dressed Isaac therewith, and she put a turban upon his head, and she fastened a precious stone in the top of the turban, and she gave them provisions for the road. And Sarah went out with them, and she accompanied them upon the road to see them off, and they said to her, \"Return to the tent.\" And when Sarah heard the words of her son Isaac, she wept bitterly, and Abraham wept with her, and their son wept with them, a great weeping, also those of their servants who went with them wept greatly. And Sarah caught hold of Isaac, and she held him in her arms, and she embraced him, and continued to weep with him, and Sarah said, \"Who knoweth if I shall ever see thee again after this day?\" Abraham departed with Isaac amid great weeping, while Sarah and the servants returned to the tent. He took two of his young men with him, Ishmael and Eliezer, and while they were walking in the road, the young men spoke these words to each other. Said Ishmael to Eliezer: \"Now my father Abraham is going with Isaac to bring him up for a burnt offering to the Lord, and when he returneth, he will give unto me all that he possesses, to inherit after him, for I am his first-born.\" Eliezer answered: \"Surely, Abraham did cast thee off with thy mother, and swear that thou shouldst not inherit anything of all he possesses. And to whom will he give all that he has, all his precious things, but unto his servant, who has been faithful in his house, to me, who have served him night and day, and have done all that he desired me?\" The holy spirit answered, \"Neither this one nor that one will inherit Abraham.\" And while Abraham and Isaac were proceeding along the road, Satan came and appeared to Abraham in the figure of a very aged man, humble and of contrite spirit, and said to him: \"Art thou silly or foolish, that thou goest to do this thing to thine only son? God gave thee a son in thy latter days, in thine old age, and wilt thou go and slaughter him, who did not commit any violence, and wilt thou cause the soul of thine only son to perish from the earth? Dost thou not know and understand that this thing cannot be from the Lord? For the Lord would not do unto man such evil, to command him, Go and slaughter thy son.\" Abraham, hearing these words, knew that it was Satan, who endeavored to turn him astray from the way of the Lord, and he rebuked him that he went away. And Satan returned and came to Isaac, and he appeared unto him in the figure of a young man, comely and well-favored, saying unto him: \"Dost thou not know that thy silly old father bringeth thee to the slaughter this day for naught? Now, my son, do not listen to him, for he is a silly old man, and let not thy precious soul and beautiful figure be lost from the earth.\" And Isaac told these words to his father, but Abraham said to him, \"Take heed of him, and do not listen to his words, for he is Satan endeavoring to lead us astray from the commands of our God.\" And Abraham rebuked Satan again, and Satan went from them, and, seeing he could not prevail over them, he transformed himself into a large brook of water in the road, and when Abraham, Isaac, and the two young men reached that place, they saw a brook large and powerful as the mighty waters. And they entered the brook, trying to pass it, but the further they went, the deeper the brook, so that the water reached up to their necks, and they were all terrified on account of the water. But Abraham recognized the place, and he knew that there had been no water there before, and he said to his son: \"I know this place, on which there was no brook nor water. Now, surely, it is Satan who doth all this to us, to draw us aside this day from the commands of God.\" And Abraham rebuked Satan, saying unto him: \"The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan. Begone from us, for we go by the command of God.\" And Satan was terri fied at the voice of Abraham, and he went away from them, and the place became dry land again as it was at first. And Abraham went with Isaac toward the place that God had told him. Satan then appeared unto Sarah in the figure of an old man, and said unto her, \"Where did thine husband go?\" She said, \"To his work.\" \"And where did thy son Isaac go?\" he inquired further, and she answered, \"He went with his father to a place of study of the Torah.\" Satan said: \"O thou poor old woman, thy teeth will be set on edge on account of thy son, as thou knowest not that Abraham took his son with him on the road to sacrifice him.\" In this hour Sarah's loins trembled, and all her limbs shook. She was no more of this world. Nevertheless she aroused herself, and said, \"All that God hath told Abraham, may he do it unto life and unto peace.\" On the third day of his journey, Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place at a distance, which God had told him. He noticed upon the mountain a pillar of fire reaching from the earth to heaven, and a heavy cloud in which the glory of God was seen. Abraham said to Isaac, \"My son, dost thou see on that mountain which we perceive at a distance that which I see upon it?\" And Isaac answered, and said unto his father, \"I see, and, lo, a pillar of fire and a cloud, and the glory of the Lord is seen upon the cloud.\" Abraham knew then that Isaac was accepted before the Lord for an offering. He asked Ishmael and Eliezer, \"Do you also see that which we see upon the mountain?\" They answered, \"We see nothing more than like the other mountains,\" and Abraham knew that they were not accepted before the Lord to go with them. Abraham said to them, \"Abide ye here with the ass, you are like the ass—as little as it sees, so little do you see. I and Isaac my son go to yonder mount, and worship there before the Lord, and this eve we will return to you.\" An unconscious prophecy had come to Abraham, for he prophesied that he and Isaac would both return from the mountain. Eliezer and Ishmael remained in that place, as Abraham had commanded, while he and Isaac went further.",

      "content": "And while they were walking along, Isaac spake unto his father, \"Behold, the fire and the wood, but where then is the lamb for a burnt offering before the Lord?\" And Abraham answered Isaac, saying, \"The Lord hath chosen thee, my son, for a perfect burnt offering, instead of the lamb.\" And Isaac said unto his father, \"I will do all that the Lord hath spoken to thee with joy and cheerfulness of heart.\" And Abraham again said unto Isaac his son, \"Is there in thy heart any thought or counsel concerning this which is not proper? Tell me, my son, I pray thee! O my son, conceal it not from me.\" And Isaac answered, \"As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is nothing in my heart to cause me to deviate either to the right or the left from the word that He hath spoken unto thee. Neither limb nor muscle hath moved or stirred on account of this, nor is there in my heart any thought or evil counsel concerning this. But I am joyful and cheerful of heart in this matter, and I say, Blessed is the Lord who has this day chosen me to be a burnt offering before Him.\" Abraham greatly rejoiced at the words of Isaac, and they went on and came together to that place that the Lord had spoken of. And Abraham approached to build the altar in that place, and Abraham did build, while Isaac handed him stones and mortar, until they finished erecting the altar. And Abraham took the wood and arranged it upon the altar, and he bound Isaac, to place him upon the wood which was upon the altar, to slay him for a burnt offering before the Lord. Isaac spake hereupon: \"Father, make haste, bare thine arm, and bind my hands and feet securely, for I am a young man, but thirty-seven years of age, and thou art an old man. When I behold the slaughtering knife in thy hand, I may perchance begin to tremble at the sight and push against thee, for the desire unto life is bold. Also I may do myself an injury and make myself unfit to be sacrificed. I adjure thee, therefore, my father, make haste, execute the will of thy Creator, delay not. Turn up thy garment, gird thy loins, and after that thou hast slaughtered me, burn me unto fine ashes. Then gather the ashes, and bring them to Sarah, my mother, and place them in a casket in her chamber. At all hours, whenever she enters her chamber, she will remember her son Isaac and weep for him.\" And again Isaac spoke: \"As soon as thou hast slaughtered me, and hast separated thyself from me, and returnest to Sarah my mother, and she asketh thee, Where is my son Isaac? what wilt thou answer her, and what will you two do in your old age?\" Abraham answered, and said, \"We know we can survive thee by a few days only. He who was our Comfort before thou wast born, will comfort us now and henceforth.\" After he had laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac on the altar, upon the wood, Abraham braced his arms, rolled up his garments, and leaned his knees upon Isaac with all his strength. And God, sitting upon His throne, high and exalted, saw how the hearts of the two were the same, and tears were rolling down from the eyes of Abraham upon Isaac, and from Isaac down upon the wood, so that it was submerged in tears. When Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son, God spoke to the angels: \"Do you see how Abraham my friend proclaims the unity of My Name in the world? Had I hearkened unto you at the time of the creation of the world, when ye spake, What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that Thou visitest him? who would there have been to make known the unity of My Name in this world?\" The angels then broke into loud weeping, and they exclaimed: \"The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth, he hath broken the covenant. Where is the reward of Abraham, he who took the wayfarers into his house, gave them food and drink, and went with them to bring them on the way? The covenant is broken, whereof Thou didst speak to him, saying, 'For in Isaac shall thy seed be called,' and saying, 'My covenant will I establish with Isaac,' for the slaughtering knife is set upon his throat.\" The tears of the angels fell upon the knife, so that it could not cut Isaac's throat, but from terror his soul escaped from him. Then God spoke to the archangel Michael, and said: \"Why standest thou here? Let him not be slaughtered.\" Without delay, Michael, anguish in his voice, cried out: \"Abraham! Abraham! Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him!\" Abraham made answer, and he said: \"God did command me to slaughter Isaac, and thou dost command me not to slaughter him! The words of the Teacher and the words of the disciple—unto whose words doth one hearken?\" Then Abraham heard it said: \"By Myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea-shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies, and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed My voice.\" At once Abraham left off from Isaac, who returned to life, revived by the heavenly voice admonishing Abraham not to slaughter his son. Abraham loosed his bonds, and Isaac stood upon his feet, and spoke the benediction, \"Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who quickenest the dead.\" Then spake Abraham to God, \"Shall I go hence without having offered up a sacrifice?\" Whereunto God replied, and said, \"Lift up thine eyes, and behold the sacrifice behind thee.\" And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and, behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket, which God had created in the twilight of Sabbath eve in the week of creation, and prepared since then as a burnt offering instead of Isaac. And the ram had been running toward Abraham, when Satan caught hold of him and entangled his horns in the thicket, that he might not advance to Abraham. And Abraham, seeing this, fetched him from the thicket, and brought him upon the altar as an offering in the place of his son Isaac. And Abraham sprinkled the blood of the ram upon the altar, and he exclaimed, and said, \"This is instead of my son, and may this be considered as the blood of my son before the Lord.\" And whatsoever Abraham did by the altar, he exclaimed, and said, \"This is instead of my son, and may it be considered before the Lord in place of my son.\" And God accepted the sacrifice of the ram, and it was accounted as though it had been Isaac. As the creation of this ram had been extraordinary, so also was the use to which all parts of his carcass were put. Not one thing went to waste. The ashes of the parts burnt upon the altar formed the foundation of the inner altar, whereon the expiatory sacrifice was brought once a year, on the Day of Atonement, the day on which the offering of Isaac took place. Of the sinews of the ram, David made ten strings for his harp upon which he played. The skin served Elijah for his girdle, and of his two horns, the one was blown at the end of the revelation on Mount Sinai, and the other will be used to proclaim the end of the Exile, when the \"great horn shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and they that were outcasts in the land of Egypt, and they shall worship the Lord in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.\" When God commanded the father to desist from sacrificing Isaac, Abraham said: \"One man tempts another, because he knoweth not what is in the heart of his neighbor. But Thou surely didst know that I was ready to sacrifice my son!\" God: \"It was manifest to Me, and I foreknew it, that thou wouldst withhold not even thy soul from Me.\" Abraham: \"And why, then, didst Thou afflict me thus?\" God: \"It was My wish that the world should become acquainted with thee, and should know that it is not without good reason that I have chosen thee from all the nations. Now it hath been witnessed unto men that thou fearest God.\" Hereupon God opened the heavens, and Abraham heard the words, \"By Myself I swear!\" Abraham: \"Thou swearest, and also I swear, I will not leave this altar until I have said what I have to say.\" God: \"Speak whatsoever thou hast to speak!\" Abraham: \"Didst Thou not promise me Thou wouldst let one come forth out of mine own bowels, whose seed should fill the whole world?\" God: \"Yes.\" Abraham: \"Whom didst Thou mean?\" God: \"Isaac.\" Abraham: \"Didst Thou not promise me to make my seed as numerous as the sand of the sea-shore?\" God: \"Yes.\" Abraham: \"Through which one of my children?\" God: \"Through Isaac.\" Abraham: \"I might have reproached Thee, and said, O Lord of the world, yesterday Thou didst tell me, In Isaac shall Thy seed be called, and now Thou sayest, Take thy son, thine only son, even Isaac, and offer him for a burnt offering. But I refrained myself, and I said nothing. Thus mayest Thou, when the children of Isaac commit trespasses and because of them fall upon evil times, be mindful of the offering of their father Isaac, and forgive their sins and deliver them from their suffering.\" God: \"Thou hast said what thou hadst to say, and I will now say what I have to say. Thy children will sin before me in time to come, and I will sit in judgment upon them on the New Year's Day. If they desire that I should grant them pardon, they shall blow the ram's horn on that day, and I, mindful of the ram that was substituted for Isaac as a sacrifice, will forgive them for their sins.\" Furthermore, the Lord revealed unto Abraham that the Temple, to be erected on the spot of Isaac's offering, would be destroyed, and as the ram substituted for Isaac extricated himself from one tree but to be caught in another, so his children would pass from kingdom to kingdom—delivered from Babylonia they would be subjugated by Media, rescued from Media they would be enslaved by Greece, escaped from Greece they would serve Rome—yet in the end they would be redeemed in a final redemption, at the sound of the ram's horn, when \"the Lord God shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.\" The place on which Abraham had erected the altar was the same whereon Adam had brought the first sacrifice, and Cain and Abel had offered their gifts to God—the same whereon Noah raised an altar to God after he left the ark; and Abraham, who knew that it was the place appointed for the Temple, called it Yireh, for it would be the abiding place of the fear and the service of God. But as Shem had given it the name Shalem, Place of Peace, and God would not give offence to either Abraham or Shem, He united the two names, and called the city by the name Jerusalem. After the sacrifice on Mount Moriah, Abraham returned to Beer-sheba, the scene of so many of his joys. Isaac was carried to Paradise by angels, and there he sojourned for three years. Thus Abraham returned home alone, and when Sarah beheld him, she exclaimed, \"Satan spoke truth when he said that Isaac was sacrificed,\" and so grieved was her soul that it fled from her body.",

      "title": "The Death And Burial Of Sarah",
      "content": "While Abraham was engaged in the sacrifice, Satan went to Sarah, and appeared to her in the figure of an old man, very humble and meek, and said to her: \"Dost thou not know all that Abraham has done unto thine only son this day? He took Isaac, and built an altar, slaughtered him, and brought him up as a sacrifice. Isaac cried and wept before his father, but he looked not at him, neither did he have compassion upon him.\" After saying these words to Sarah, Satan went away from her, and she thought him to be an old man from amongst the sons of men who had been with her son. Sarah lifted up her voice, and cried bitterly, saying: \"O my son, Isaac, my son, O that I had this day died instead of thee I It grieves me for thee! After that I have reared thee and have brought thee up, my joy is turned into mourning over thee. In my longing for a child, I cried and prayed, till I bore thee at ninety. Now hast thou served this day for the knife and the fire. But I console myself, it being the word of God, and thou didst perform the command of thy God, for who can transgress the word of our God, in whose hands is the soul of every living creature? Thou art just, O Lord our God, for all Thy works are good and righteous, for I also rejoice with the word which Thou didst command, and while mine eye weepeth bitterly, my heart rejoiceth.\" And Sarah laid her head upon the bosom of one of her handmaids, and she became as still as a stone. She rose up afterward and went about making inquiries concerning her son, till she came to Hebron, and no one could tell her what had happened to her son. Her servants went to seek him in the house of Shem and Eber, and they could not find him, and they sought throughout the land, and he was not there. And, behold, Satan came to Sarah in the shape of an old man, and said unto her, \"I spoke falsely unto thee, for Abraham did not kill his son, and he is not dead,\" and when she heard the word, her joy was so exceedingly violent that her soul went out through joy. When Abraham with Isaac returned to Beer-sheba, they sought for Sarah and could not find her, and when they made inquiries concerning her, they were told that she had gone as far as Hebron to seek them. Abraham and Isaac went to her to Hebron, and when they found that she was dead, they cried bitterly over her, and Isaac said: \"O my mother, my mother, how hast thou left me, and whither hast thou gone? O whither hast thou gone, and how hast thou left me?\" And Abraham and all his servants wept and mourned over her a great and heavy mourning, even that Abraham did not pray, but spent his time in mourning and weeping over Sarah. And, indeed, he had great reason to mourn his loss, for even in her old age Sarah had retained the beauty of her youth and the innocence of her childhood. The death of Sarah was a loss not only for Abraham and his family, but for the whole country. So long as she was alive, all went well in the land. After her death confusion ensued. The weeping, lamenting, and wailing over her going hence was universal, and Abraham, instead of receiving consolation, had to offer consolation to others. He spoke to the mourning people, and said: \"My children, take not the going hence of Sarah too much to heart. There is one event unto all, to the pious and the impious alike. I pray you now, give me a burying-place with you, not as a gift, but for money.\" In these last few words Abraham's unassuming modesty was expressed. God had promised him the whole land, yet when he came to bury his dead, he had to pay for the grave, and it did not enter his heart to cast aspersions upon the ways of God. In all humility he spake to the people of Hebron, saying, \"I am a stranger and a sojourner with you.\" Therefore spake God to him, and said, \"Thou didst bear thyself modestly. As thou livest, I will appoint thee lord and prince over them.\" To the people themselves he appeared an angel, and they answered his words, saying: \"Thou art a prince of God among us. In the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead, among the rich if thou wilt, or among the poor if thou wilt.\" Abraham first of all gave thanks to God for the friendly feeling shown to him by the children of Heth, and then he continued his negotiations for the Cave of Machpelah. He had long known the peculiar value of this spot. Adam had chosen it as a burial-place for himself. He had feared his body might be used for idolatrous purposes after his death; he therefore designated the Cave of Machpelah as the place of his burial, and in the depths his corpse was laid, so that none might find it. When he interred Eve there, he wanted to dig deeper, because he scented the sweet fragrance of Paradise, near the entrance to which it lay, but a heavenly voice called to him, Enough! Adam himself was buried there by Seth, and until the time of Abraham the place was guarded by angels, who kept a fire burning near it perpetually, so that none dared approach it and bury his dead therein. Now, it happened on the day when Abraham received the angels in his house, and he wanted to slaughter an ox for their entertainment, that the ox ran away, and in his pursuit of him Abraham entered the Cave of Machpelah. There he saw Adam and Eve stretched out upon couches, candles burning at the head of their resting-places, while a sweet scent pervaded the cave. Therefore Abraham wished to acquire the Cave of Machpelah from the children of Heth, the inhabitants of the city of Jebus. They said to him. \"We know that in time to come God will give these lands unto thy seed, and now do thou swear a covenant with us that Israel shall not wrest the city of Jebus from its inhabitants without their consent.\" Abraham agreed to the condition, and he acquired the field from Ephron, in whose possession it lay. This happened the very day on which Ephron had been made the chief of the children of Heth, and he had been raised to the position so that Abraham might not have to have dealings with a man of low rank. It was of advantage to Abraham, too, for Ephron at first refused to sell his field, and only the threat of the children of Heth to depose him from his office, unless he fulfilled the desire of Abraham, could induce him to change his disposition. Dissembling deceitfully, Ephron then offered to give Abraham the field without compensation, but when Abraham insisted upon paying for it, Ephron said: \"My lord, hearken unto me. A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that betwixt me and thee?\" showing only too well that the money was of the greatest consequence to him. Abraham understood his words, and when he came to pay for the field, he weighed out the sum agreed upon between them in the best of current coin. A deed, signed by four witnesses, was drawn up, and the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, the field, and the cave which was therein, were made sure unto Abraham and his descendants for all times. The burial of Sarah then took place, amid great magnificence and the sympathy of all. Shem and his son Eber, Abimelech king of the Philistines, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, as well as all the great of the land, followed her bier. A seven days' mourning was kept for her, and all the inhabitants of the land came to condole with Abraham and Isaac. When Abraham entered the cave to place the body of Sarah within, Adam and Eve refused to remain there, \"because,\" they said, \"as it is, we are ashamed in the presence of God on account of the sin we committed, and now we shall be even more ashamed on account of your good deeds.\" Abraham soothed Adam. He promised to pray to God for him, that the need for shame be removed from him. Adam resumed his place, and Abraham entombed Sarah, and at the same time he carried Eve, resisting, back to her place. One year after the death of Sarah, Abimelech king of the Philistines died, too, at the age of one hundred and ninety-three years. His successor upon the throne was his twelve-year old son Benmelek, who took the name of his father after his accession. Abraham did not fail to pay a visit of condolence at the court of Abimelech. Lot also died about this time, at the age of one hundred and forty-two. His sons, Moab and Ammon, both married Canaanitish wives. Moab begot a son, and Ammon had six sons, and the descendants of both were numerous exceedingly. Abraham suffered a severe loss at the same time in the death of his brother Nahor, whose days ended at Haran, when he had reached the age of one hundred and seventy two years.",

      "content": "The death of Sarah dealt Abraham a blow from which he did not recover. So long as she was alive, he felt himself young and vigorous, but after she had passed away, old age suddenly overtook him. It was he himself who made the plea that age be betrayed by suitable signs and tokens. Before the time of Abraham an old man was not distinguishable externally from a young man, and as Isaac was the image of his father, it happened frequently that father and son were mistaken for each other, and a request meant for the one was preferred to the other. Abraham prayed therefore that old age might have marks to distinguish it from youth, and God granted his petition, and since the time of Abraham the appearance of men changes in old age. This is one of the seven great wonders that have occurred in the course of history. The blessing of God did not forsake Abraham in old age, either. That it might not be said it had been granted to him only for the sake of Sarah, God prospered him after her death, too. Hagar bore him a daughter, and Ishmael repented of his evil ways and subordinated himself to Isaac. And as Abraham enjoyed undisturbed happiness in his family, so also outside, in the world. The kings of the east and the west eagerly besieged the door of his house in order to derive benefit from his wisdom. From his neck a precious stone was suspended, which possessed the power of healing the sick who looked upon it. On the death of Abraham, God attached it to the wheel of the sun. The greatest blessing enjoyed by him, and by none beside except his son Isaac and Jacob the son of Isaac, was that the evil inclination had no power over him, so that in this life he had a foretaste of the future world. But all these Divine blessings showered upon Abraham were not undeserved. He was clean of hand, and pure of heart, one that did not lift up his soul unto vanity. He fulfilled all the commands that were revealed later, even the Rabbinical injunctions, as, for instance, the one relating to the limits of a Sabbath day's journey, wherefor his reward was that God disclosed to him the new teachings which He expounded daily in the heavenly academy. But one thing lacked to complete the happiness of Abraham, the marriage of Isaac. He therefore called his old servant Eliezer unto himself. Eliezer resembled his master not only externally, in his appearance, but also spiritually. Like Abraham he possessed full power over the evil inclination, and like the master, the servant was an adept in the law. Abraham spake the following words to Eliezer: \"I am stricken in age, and I know not the day of my death. Therefore prepare thyself, and go unto my country, and to my kindred, and fetch hither a wife for my son.\" Thus he spake by reason of the resolution he had taken immediately after the sacrifice of Isaac on Moriah, for he had there said within himself, that if the sacrifice had been executed, Isaac would have gone hence childless. He was even ready to choose a wife for his son from among the daughters of his three friends, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, because he knew them to be pious, and he did not attach much importance to aristocratic stock. Then spake God to him, and said: \"Concern thyself not about a wife for Isaac. One has already been provided for him,\" and it was made known to Abraham that Milcah, the wife of his brother Nahor, childless until the birth of Isaac, had then been remembered by God and made fruitful. She bore Bethuel, and he in turn, at the time of Isaac's sacrifice, begot the daughter destined to be the wife of Isaac. Mindful of the proverb, \"Even if the wheat of thine own place be darnel, use it for seed,\" Abraham determined to take a wife for Isaac from his own family. He argued that as any wife he chose would have to become a proselyte, it would be best to use his own stock, which had the first claim upon him. Eliezer now said to his master: \"Peradventure no woman will be willing to follow me unto this land. May I then marry my own daughter to Isaac?\" \"No,\" replied Abraham, \"thou art of the accursed race, and my son is of the blessed race, and curse and blessing cannot be united. But beware thou that thou bring not my son again unto the land from whence I came, for if thou broughtest him thither again, it were as though thou tookest him to hell. God who sets the heavens in motion, He will set this matter right, too, and He that took me from my father's house, and that spake unto me, and that swore unto me in Haran, and at the covenant of the pieces, that He would give this land unto my seed, He shall send His excellent angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence.\" Eliezer then swore to his master concerning the matter, and Abraham made him take the oath by the sign of the covenant.",

      "content": "Attended by ten men, mounted upon ten camels laden with jewels and trinkets, Eliezer betook himself to Haran under the convoy of two angels, the one appointed to keep guard over Eliezer, the other over Rebekah. The journey to Haran took but a few hours, at evening of the same day he reached there, because the earth hastened to meet him in a wonderful way. He made a halt at the well of water, and he prayed to God to permit him to distinguish the wife appointed for Isaac among the damsels that came to draw water, by this token, that she alone, and not the others, would give him drink. Strictly speaking, this wish of his was unseemly, for suppose a bondwoman had given him water to drink! But God granted his request. All the damsels said they could not give him of their water, because they had to take it home. Then appeared Rebekah, coming to the well contrary to her wont, for she was the daughter of a king, Bethuel her father being king of Haran. When Eliezer addressed his request for water to drink to this young innocent child, not only was she ready to do his bidding, but she rebuked the other maidens on account of their discourtesy to a stranger. Eliezer noticed, too, how the water rose up to her of its own accord from the bottom of the well, so that she needed not to exert herself to draw it. Having scrutinized her carefully, he felt certain that she was the wife chosen for Isaac. He gave her a nose ring, wherein was set a precious stone, half a shekel in weight, foreshadowing the half-shekel which her descendants would once bring to the sanctuary year by year. He gave her also two bracelets for her hands, of ten shekels weight in gold, in token of the two tables of stone and the Ten Commandments upon them. When Rebekah, bearing the jewels, came to her mother and to her brother Laban, this one hastened to Eliezer in order to slay him and take possession of his goods. Laban soon learnt that he would not be able to do much harm to a giant like Eliezer. He met him at the moment when Eliezer seized two camels and bore them across the stream. Besides, on account of Eliezer's close resemblance to Abraham, Laban thought he saw Abraham before him, and he said: \"Come in, thou blessed of the Lord! It is not becoming that thou shouldst stand without, I have cleansed my house of idols.\" But when Eliezer arrived at the house of Bethuel, they tried to kill him with cunning. They set poisoned food before him. Luckily, he refused to eat before he had discharged himself of his errand. While he was telling his story, it was ordained by God that the dish intended for him should come to stand in front of Bethuel, who ate of it and died. Eliezer showed the document he had in which Abraham deeded all his possessions to Isaac, and he made it known to the kindred of Abraham, how deeply attached to them his master was, in spite of the long years of separation. Yet he let them know at the same time that Abraham was not dependent wholly upon them. He might seek a wife for his son among the daughters of Ishmael or Lot. At first the kindred of Abraham consented to let Rebekah go with Eliezer, but as Bethuel had died in the meantime, they did not want to give Rebekah in marriage without consulting her. Besides, they deemed it proper that she should remain at home at least during the week of mourning for her father. But Eliezer, seeing the angel wait for him, would brook no delay, and he said, \"The man who came with me and prospered my way, waits for me without,\" and as Rebekah professed herself ready to go at once with Eliezer, her mother and brother granted her wish and dismissed her with their blessings. But their blessings did not come from the bottom of their hearts. Indeed, as a rule, the blessing of the impious is a curse, wherefore Rebekah remained barren for years. Eliezer's return to Canaan was as wonderful as his going to Haran had been. A seventeen days' journey he accomplished in three hours. He left Haran at noon, and he arrived at Hebron at three o'clock in the afternoon, the time for the Minhah Prayer, which had been introduced by Isaac. He was in the posture of praying when Rebekah first laid eyes upon him, wherefore she asked Eliezer what man this was. She saw he was not an ordinary individual. She noticed the unusual beauty of Isaac, and also that an angel accompanied him. Thus her question was not dictated by mere curiosity. At this moment she learnt through the holy spirit, that she was destined to be the mother of the godless Esau. Terror seized her at the knowledge, and, trembling, she fell from the camel and inflicted an injury upon herself. After Isaac had heard the wonderful adventures of Eliezer, he took Rebekah to the tent of his mother Sarah, and she showed herself worthy to be her successor. The cloud appeared again that had been visible over the tent during the life of Sarah, and had vanished at her death; the light shone again in the tent of Rebekah that Sarah had kindled at the coming in of the Sabbath, and that had burnt miraculously throughout the week; the blessing returned with Rebekah that had hovered over the dough kneaded by Sarah; and the gates of the tent were opened for the needy, wide and spacious, as they had been during the lifetime of Sarah. For three years Isaac had mourned for his mother, and he could find no consolation in the academy of Shem and Eber, his abiding-place during that period. But Rebekah comforted him after his mother's death, for she was the counterpart of Sarah in person and in spirit. As a reward for having executed to his full satisfaction the mission with which he had charged him, Abraham set his bondman free. The curse resting upon Eliezer, as upon all the descendants of Canaan, was transformed into a blessing, because he ministered unto Abraham loyally. Greatest reward of all, God found him worthy of entering Paradise alive, a distinction that fell to the lot of very few.",

      "content": "Rebekah first saw Isaac as he was coming from the way of Beer-lahai-roi, the dwelling-place of Hagar, whither he had gone after the death of his mother, for the purpose of reuniting his father with Hagar, or, as she is also called, Keturah. Hagar bore him six sons, who, however, did scant honor to their father, for they all were idolaters. Abraham, therefore, during his own lifetime, sent them away from the presence of Isaac, that they might not be singed by Isaac's flame, and gave them the instruction to journey eastward as far as possible. There he built a city for them, surrounded by an iron wall, so high that the sun could not shine into the city. But Abraham provided them with huge gems and pearls, their lustre more brilliant than the light of the sun, which will be used in the Messianic time when \"the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed.\" Also Abraham taught them the black art, wherewith they held sway over demons and spirits. It is from this city in the east that Laban, Balaam, and Balaam's father Beor derived their sorceries. Epher, one of the grandsons of Abraham and Keturah, invaded Lybia with an armed force, and took possession of the country. From this Epher the whole land of Africa has its name. Aram is also a country made habitable by a kinsman of Abraham. In his old age Terah contracted a new marriage with Pelilah, and from this union sprang a son Zoba, who was the father in turn of three sons. The oldest of these, Aram, was exceedingly rich and powerful, and the old home in Haran sufficed not for him and his kinsmen, the sons of Nahor, the brother of Abraham. Aram and his brethren and all that belonged to him therefore departed from Haran, and they settled in a vale, and they built themselves a city there which they called Aram-Zoba, to perpetuate the name of the father and his first-born son. Another Aram, Aram-naharaim, on the Euphrates, was built by Aram son of Kemuel, a nephew of Abraham. Its real name was Petor, after the son of Aram, but it is better known as Aram-naharaim. The descendants of Kesed, another nephew of Abraham, a son of his brother Nahor, established themselves opposite to Shinar, where they founded the city of Kesed, the city whence the Chaldees are called Kasdim. Though Abraham knew full well that Isaac deserved his paternal blessing beyond all his sons, yet he withheld it from him, that no hostile feelings be aroused among his descendants. He spake, and said: \"I am but flesh and blood, here to-day, to-morrow in the grave. What I was able to do for my children I have done. Henceforth let come what God desires to do in His world,\" and it happened that immediately after the death of Abraham God Himself appeared unto Isaac, and gave him His blessing.",

      "content": "When the day of the death of Abraham drew near, the Lord said to Michael, \"Arise and go to Abraham and say to him, Thou shalt depart from life!\" so that he might set his house in order before he died. And Michael went and came to Abraham and found him sitting before his oxen for ploughing. Abraham, seeing Michael, but not knowing who he was, saluted him and said to him, \"Sit down a little while, and I will order a beast to be brought, and we will go to my house, that thou mayest rest with me, for it is toward evening, and arise in the morning and go whithersoever thou wilt.\" And Abraham called one of his servants, and said to him: \"Go and bring me a beast, that the stranger may sit upon it, for he is wearied with his journey.\" But Michael said, \"I abstain from ever sitting upon any fourfooted beast, let us walk therefore, till we reach the house.\" On their way to the house they passed a huge tree, and Abraham heard a voice from its branches, singing, \"Holy art thou, because thou hast kept the purpose for which thou wast sent.\" Abraham hid the mystery in his heart, thinking that the stranger did not hear it. Arrived at his house, he ordered the servants to prepare a meal, and while they were busy with their work, he called his son Isaac, and said to him, \"Arise and put water in the vessel, that we may wash the feet of the stranger.\" And he brought it as he was commanded, and Abraham said, \"I perceive that in this basin I shall never again wash the feet of any man coming to us as a guest.\" Hearing this, Isaac began to weep, and Abraham, seeing his son weep, also wept, and Michael, seeing them weep, wept also, and the tears of Michael fell into the water, and became precious stones. Before sitting down to the table, Michael arose, went out for a moment, as if to ease nature, and ascended to heaven in the twinkling of an eye, and stood before the Lord, and said to Him: \"Lord and Master, let Thy power know that I am unable to remind that righteous man of his death, for I have not seen upon the earth a man like him, compassionate, hospitable, righteous, truthful, devout, refraining from every evil deed.\" Then the Lord said to Michael, \"Go down to My friend Abraham, and whatever he may say to thee, that do thou also, and whatever he may eat, eat thou also with him, and I will cast the thought of the death of Abraham into the heart of Isaac, his son, in a dream, and Isaac will relate the dream, and thou shalt interpret it, and he himself will know his end.\" And Michael said, \"Lord, all the heavenly spirits are incorporeal, and neither eat nor drink, and this man has set before me a table with an abundance of all good things earthly and corruptible. Now, Lord, what shall I do?\" The Lord answered him, \"Go down to him and take no thought for this, for when thou sittest down with him, I will send upon thee a devouring spirit, and it will consume out of thy hands and through thy mouth all that is on the table.\" Then Michael went into the house of Abraham, and they ate and drank and were merry. And when the supper was ended, Abraham prayed after his custom, and Michael prayed with him, and each lay down to sleep upon his couch in one room, while Isaac went to his chamber, lest he be troublesome to the guest. About the seventh hour of the night, Isaac awoke and came to the door of his father's chamber, crying out and saying, \"Open, father, that I may touch thee before they take thee away from me.\" And Abraham wept together with his son, and when Michael saw them weep, he wept likewise. And Sarah, hearing the weeping, called forth from her bedchamber, saying: \"My lord Abraham, why this weeping? Has the stranger told thee of thy brother's son Lot, that he is dead? or has aught befallen us?\" Michael answered, and said to her, \"Nay, my sister Sarah, it is not as thou sayest, but thy son Isaac, methinks, beheld a dream, and came to us weeping, and we, seeing him, were moved in our hearts and wept.\" Sarah, hearing Michael speak, knew straightway that it was an angel of the Lord, one of the three angels whom they had entertained in their house once before, and therefore she made a sign to Abraham to come out toward the door, to inform him of what she knew. Abraham said: \"Thou hast perceived well, for I, too, when I washed his feet, knew in my heart that they were the feet that I had washed at the oak of Mamre, and that went to save Lot.\" Abraham, returning to his chamber, made Isaac relate his dream, which Michael interpreted to them, saying: \"Thy son Isaac has spoken truth, for thou shalt go and be taken up into the heavens, but thy body shall remain on earth, until seven thousand ages are fulfilled, for then all flesh shall arise. Now, therefore, Abraham, set thy house in order, for thou wast heard what is decreed concerning thee.\" Abraham answered, \"Now I know thou art an angel of the Lord, and wast sent to take my soul, but I will not go with thee, but do thou whatever thou art commanded.\" Michael returned to heaven and told God of Abraham's refusal to obey his summons, and he was again commanded to go down and admonish Abraham not to rebel against God, who had bestowed many blessings upon him, and he reminded him that no one who has come from Adam and Eve can escape death, and that God in His great kindness toward him did not permit the sickle of death to meet him, but sent His chief captain, Michael, to him. \"Wherefore, then,\" he ended, \"hast thou said to the chief captain, I will not go with thee?\" When Michael delivered these exhortations to Abraham, he saw that it was futile to oppose the will of God, and he consented to die, but wished to have one desire of his fulfilled while still alive. He said to Michael: \"I beseech thee, lord, if I must depart from my body, I desire to be taken up in my body, that I may see the creatures that the Lord has created in heaven and on earth.\" Michael went up into heaven, and spake before the Lord concerning Abraham, and the Lord answered Michael, \"Go and take up Abraham in the body and show him all things, and whatever he shall say to thee, do to him as to My friend.\"",

      "content": "The archangel Michael went down, and took Abraham upon a chariot of the cherubim, and lifted him up into the air of heaven, and led him upon the cloud, together with sixty angels, and Abraham ascended upon the chariot over all the earth, and saw all things that are below on the earth, both good and bad. Looking down upon the earth, he saw a man committing adultery with a wedded woman, and turning to Michael he said, \"Send fire from heaven to consume them.\" Straightway there came down fire and consumed them, for God had commanded Michael to do whatsoever Abraham should ask him to do. He looked again, and he saw thieves digging through a house, and Abraham said, \"Let wild beasts come out of the desert, and tear them in pieces,\" and immediately wild beasts came out of the desert and devoured them. Again he looked down, and he saw people preparing to commit murder, and he said, \"Let the earth open and swallow them,\" and, as he spoke, the earth swallowed them alive. Then God spoke to Michael: \"Turn away Abraham to his own house and let him not go round the whole earth, because he has no compassion on sinners, but I have compassion on sinners, that they may turn and live and repent of their sins, and be saved.\" So Michael turned the chariot, and brought Abraham to the place of judgment of all souls. Here he saw two gates, the one broad and the other narrow, the narrow gate that of the just, which leads to life, they that enter through it go into Paradise. The broad gate is that of sinners, which leads to destruction and eternal punishment. Then Abraham wept, saying, \"Woe is me, what shall I do? for I am a man big of body, and how shall I be able to enter by the narrow gate?\" Michael answered, and said to Abraham, \"Fear not, nor grieve, for thou shalt enter by it unhindered, and all they who are like thee.\" Abraham, perceiving that a soul was adjudged to be set in the midst, asked Michael the reason for it, and Michael answered, \"Because the judge found its sins and its righteousness equal, he neither committed it to judgment nor to be saved.\" Abraham said to Michael, \"Let us pray for this soul, and see whether God will hear us,\" and when they rose up from their prayer, Michael informed Abraham that the soul was saved by the prayer, and was taken by an angel and carried up to Paradise. Abraham said to Michael, \"Let us yet call upon the Lord and supplicate His compassion and entreat His mercy for the souls of the sinners whom I formerly, in my anger, cursed and destroyed, whom the earth devoured, and the wild beasts tore in pieces, and the fire consumed, through my words. Now I know that I have sinned before the Lord our God.\" After the joint prayer of the archangel and Abraham, there came a voice from heaven, saying, \"Abraham, Abraham, I have hearkened to thy voice and thy prayer, and I forgive thee thy sin, and those whom thou thinkest that I destroyed, I have called up and brought them into life by My exceeding kindness, because for a season I have requited them in judgment, and those whom I destroy living upon earth, I will not requite in death.\" When Michael brought Abraham back to his house, they found Sarah dead. Not seeing what had become of Abraham, she was consumed with grief and gave up her soul. Though Michael had fulfilled Abraham's wish, and had shown him all the earth and the judgment and recompense, he still refused to surrender his soul to Michael, and the archangel again ascended to heaven, and said unto the Lord: \"Thus speaks Abraham, I will not go with thee, and I refrain from laying my hands on him, because from the beginning he was Thy friend, and he has done all things pleasing in Thy sight. There is no man like him on earth, not even Job, the wondrous man.\" But when the day of the death of Abraham drew nigh, God commanded Michael to adorn Death with great beauty and send him thus to Abraham, that he might see him with his eyes. While sitting under the oak of Mamre, Abraham perceived a flashing of light and a smell of sweet odor, and turning around he saw Death coming toward him in great glory and beauty. And Death said unto Abraham: \"Think not, Abraham, that this beauty is mine, or that I come thus to every man. Nay, but if any one is righteous like thee, I thus take a crown and come to him, but if he is a sinner, I come in great corruption, and out of their sins I make a crown for my head, and I shake them with great fear, so that they are dismayed.\" Abraham said to him, \"And art thou, indeed, he that is called Death?\" He answered, and said, \"I am the bitter name,\" but Abraham answered, \"I will not go with thee.\" And Abraham said to Death, \"Show us thy corruption.\" And Death revealed his corruption, showing two heads, the one had the face of a serpent, the other head was like a sword. All the servants of Abraham, looking at the fierce mien of Death, died, but Abraham prayed to the Lord, and he raised them up. As the looks of Death were not able to cause Abraham's soul to depart from him, God removed the soul of Abraham as in a dream, and the archangel Michael took it up into heaven. After great praise and glory had been given to the Lord by the angels who brought Abraham's soul, and after Abraham bowed down to worship, then came the voice of God, saying thus: \"Take My friend Abraham into Paradise, where are the tabernacles of My righteous ones and the abodes of My saints Isaac and Jacob in his bosom, where there is no trouble, nor grief, nor sighing, but peace and rejoicing and life unending.\" Abraham's activity did not cease with his death, and as he interceded in this world for the sinners, so will he intercede for them in the world to come. On the day of judgment he will sit at the gate of hell, and he will not suffer those who kept the law of circumcision to enter therein.",

      "content": "Once upon a time some Jews lived in Hebron, few in number, but pious and good, and particularly hospitable. When strangers came to the Cave of Machpelah to pray there, the inhabitants of the place fairly quarrelled with each other for the privilege of entertaining the guests, and the one who carried off the victory rejoiced as though he had found great spoil. On the eve of the Day of Atonement, it appeared that, in spite of all their efforts, the dwellers at Hebron could not secure the tenth man needed for public Divine service, and they feared they would have none on the holy day. Toward evening, when the sun was about to sink, they descried an old man with silver white beard, bearing a sack upon his shoulder, his raiment tattered, and his feet badly swollen from much walking. They ran to meet him, took him to one of the houses, gave him food and drink, and, after supplying him with new white garments, they all together went to the synagogue for worship. Asked what his name was, the stranger replied, Abraham. At the end of the fast, the residents of Hebron cast lots for the privilege of entertaining the guest. Fortune favored the beadle, who, the envy of the rest, bore his guest away to his house. On the way, he suddenly disappeared, and the beadle could not find him anywhere. In vain all the Jews of the place went on a quest for him. Their sleepless night, spent in searching, had no result. The stranger could not be found. But no sooner had the beadle lain down, toward morning, weary and anxious, to snatch some sleep, than he saw the lost guest before him, his face luminous as lightning, and his garments magnificent and studded with gems radiant as the sun. Before the beadle, stunned by fright, could open his mouth, the stranger spake, and said: \"I am Abraham the Hebrew, your ancestor, who rests here in the Cave of Machpelah. When I saw how grieved you were at not having the number of men prescribed for a public service, I came forth to you. Have no fear! Rejoice and be merry of heart!\" On another occasion Abraham granted his assistance to the people of Hebron. The lord of the city was a heartless man, who oppressed the Jews sorely. One day he commanded them to pay a large sum of money into his coffers, the whole sum in uniform coins, all stamped with the same year. It was but a pretext to kill the Jews. He knew that his demand was impossible of fulfilment. The Jews proclaimed a fast and day of public prayer, on which to supplicate God that He turn aside the sword suspended above them. The night following, the beadle in a dream saw an awe-inspiring old man, who addressed him in the following words: \"Up, quickly! Hasten to the gate of the court, where lies the money you need. I am your father Abraham. I have beheld the affliction wherewith the Gentiles oppress you, but God has heard your groans.\" In great terror the beadle arose, but he saw no one, yet he went to the spot designated by the vision, and he found the money and took it to the congregation, telling his dream at the same time. Amazed, they counted the gold, precisely the amount required of them by the prince, no more and no less. They surrendered the sum to him, and he who had considered compliance with his demand impossible, recognized now that God is with the Jews, and thenceforth they found favor in his eyes.",

He resembled him in every particular—\"in beauty, wisdom, strength, wealth, and noble deeds.\" It was, therefore, as great an honor for Isaac to be called the son of his father as for Abraham to be called the father of his son, and though Abraham was the progenitor of thirty nations, he is always designated as the father of Isaac. Despite his many excellent qualities, Isaac married late in life. God permitted him to meet the wife suitable to him only after he had successfully disproved the mocking charges of Ishmael, who was in the habit of taunting him with having been circumcised at the early age of eight days, while Ishmael had submitted himself voluntarily to the operation when he was thirteen years old. For this reason God demanded Isaac as a sacrifice when he had attained to full manhood, at the age of thirty-seven, and Isaac was ready to give up his life. Ishmael's jibes were thus robbed of their sting, and Isaac was permitted to marry. But another delay occurred before his marriage could take place. Directly after the sacrifice on Mount Moriah, his mother died, and he mourned her for three years. Finally he married Rebekah, who was then a maiden of fourteen. Rebekah was \"a rose between thorns.\" Her father was the Aramean Bethuel, and her brother was Laban, but she did not walk in their ways. Her piety was equal to Isaac's. Nevertheless their marriage was not entirely happy, for they lived together no less than twenty years without begetting children. Rebekah besought her husband to entreat God for the gift of children, as his father Abraham had done. At first Isaac would not do her bidding. God had promised Abraham a numerous progeny, and he thought their childlessness was probably Rebekah's fault, and it was her duty to supplicate God, and not his. But Rebekah would not desist, and husband and wife repaired to Mount Moriah together to pray to God there. And Isaac said: \"O Lord God of heaven and earth, whose goodness and mercies fill the earth, Thou who didst take my father from his father's house and from his birthplace, and didst bring him unto this land, and didst say unto him, To thee and thy seed will I give the land, and didst promise him and declare unto him, I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand of the sea, now may Thy words be verified which Thou didst speak unto my father. For Thou art the Lord our God, our eyes are toward Thee, to give us seed of men as Thou didst promise us, for Thou art the Lord our God, and our eyes are upon Thee.\" Isaac prayed furthermore that all children destined for him might be born unto him from this pious wife of his, and Rebekah made the same petition regarding her husband Isaac and the children destined for her. Their united prayer was heard. Yet it was chiefly for the sake of Isaac that God gave them children. It is true, Rebekah's piety equalled her husband's, but the prayer of a pious man who is the son of a pious man is far more efficacious than the prayer of one who, though pious himself, is descended from a godless father. The prayer wrought a great miracle, for Isaac's physique was such that he could not have been expected to beget children, and equally it was not in the course of nature that Rebekah should bear children. When Rebekah had been pregnant seven months, she began to wish that the curse of childlessness had not been removed from her. She suffered torturous pain, because her twin sons began their lifelong quarrels in her womb. They strove to kill each other. If Rebekah walked in the vicinity of a temple erected to idols, Esau moved in her body, and if she passed a synagogue or a Bet ha-Midrash, Jacob essayed to break forth from her womb. The quarrels of the children turned upon such differences as these. Esau would insist that there was no life except the earthly life of material pleasures, and Jacob would reply: \"My brother, there are two worlds before us, this world and the world to come. In this world, men eat and drink, and traffic and marry, and bring up sons and daughters, but all this does not take place in the world to come. If it please thee, do thou take this world, and I will take the other.\" Esau had Samael as his ally, who desired to slay Jacob in his mother's womb. But the archangel Michael hastened to Jacob's aid. He tried to burn Samael, and the Lord saw it was necessary to constitute a heavenly court for the purpose of arbitrating the case of Michael and Samael. Even the quarrel between the two brothers regarding the birthright had its beginning before they emerged from the womb of their mother. Each desired to be the first to come into the world. It was only when Esau threatened to carry his point at the expense of his mother's life that Jacob gave way. Rebekah asked other women whether they, too, had suffered such pain during their pregnancy, and when they told her they had not heard of a case like hers, except the pregnancy of Nimrod's mother, she betook herself to Mount Moriah, whereon Shem and Eber had their Bet ha-Midrash. She requested them as well as Abraham to inquire of God what the cause of her dire suffering was. And Shem replied: \"My daughter, I confide a secret to thee. See to it that none finds it out. Two nations are in thy womb, and how should thy body contain them, seeing that the whole world will not be large enough for them to exist in it together peaceably? Two nations they are, each owning a world of its own, the one the Torah, the other sin. From the one will spring Solomon, the builder of the Temple, from the other Vespasian, the destroyer thereof. These two are what are needed to raise the number of nations to seventy. They will never be in the same estate. Esau will vaunt lords, while Jacob will bring forth prophets, and if Esau has princes, Jacob will have kings. They, Israel and Rome, are the two nations destined to be hated by all the world. One will exceed the other in strength. First Esau will subjugate the whole world, but in the end Jacob will rule over all. The older of the two will serve the younger, provided this one is pure of heart, otherwise the younger will be enslaved by the older.\" The circumstances connected with the birth of her twin sons were as remarkable as those during the period of Rebekah's pregnancy. Esau was the first to see the light, and with him all impurity came from the womb; Jacob was born clean and sweet of body. Esau was brought forth with hair, beard, and teeth, both front and back, and he was blood-red, a sign of his future sanguinary nature. On account of his ruddy appearance he remained uncircumcised. Isaac, his father, feared that it was due to poor circulation of the blood, and he hesitated to perform the circumcision. He decided to wait until Esau should attain his thirteenth year, the age at which Ishmael had received the sign of the covenant. But when Esau grew up, he refused to give heed to his father's wish, and so he was left uncircumcised. The opposite of his brother in this as in all respects, Jacob was born with the sign of the covenant upon his body, a rare distinction. But Esau also bore a mark upon him at birth, the figure of a serpent, the symbol of all that is wicked and hated of God. The names conferred upon the brothers are pregnant with meaning. The older was called Esau, because he was 'Asui, fully developed when he was born, and the name of the younger was given to him by God, to point to some important events in the future of Israel by the numerical value of each letter. The first letter in Ya'akob, Yod, with the value of ten, stands for the decalogue; the second, 'Ayin, equal to seventy, for the seventy elders, the leaders of Israel; the third, Kof, a hundred, for the Temple, a hundred ells in height; and the last, Bet, for the two tables of stone.",

      "content": "While Esau and Jacob were little, their characters could not be judged properly. They were like the myrtle and the thorn-bush, which look alike in the early stages of their growth. After they have attained full size, the myrtle is known by its fragrance, and the thorn-bush by its thorns. In their childhood, both brothers went to school, but when they reached their thirteenth year, and were of age, their ways parted. Jacob continued his studies in the Bet ha Midrash of Shem and Eber, and Esau abandoned himself to idolatry and an immoral life. Both were hunters of men, Esau tried to capture them in order to turn them away from God, and Jacob, to turn them toward God. In spite of his impious deeds, Esau possessed the art of winning his father's love. His hypocritical conduct made Isaac believe that his first-born son was extremely pious. \"Father,\" he would ask Isaac, \"what is the tithe on straw and salt?\" The question made him appear God-fearing in the eyes of his father, because these two products are the very ones that are exempt from tithing. Isaac failed to notice, too, that his older son gave him forbidden food to eat. What he took for the flesh of young goats was dog's meat. Rebekah was more clear-sighted. She knew her sons as they really were, and therefore her love for Jacob was exceeding great. The oftener she heard his voice, the deeper grew her affection for him. Abraham agreed with her. He also loved his grandson Jacob, for he knew that in him his name and his seed would be called. And he said unto Rebekah, \"My daughter, watch over my son Jacob, for he shall be in my stead on the earth and for a blessing in the midst of the children of men, and for the glory of the whole seed of Shem.\" Having admonished Rebekah thus to keep guard over Jacob, who was destined to be the bearer of the blessing given to Abraham by God, he called for his grandson, and in the presence of Rebekah he blessed him, and said: \"Jacob, my beloved son, whom my soul loveth, may God bless thee from above the firmament, and may He give thee all the blessing wherewith He blessed Adam, and Enoch, and Noah, and Shem, and all the things of which He told me, and all the things which He promised to give me may He cause to cleave to thee and to thy seed forever, according to the days of the heavens above the earth. And the spirit of Mastema shall not rule over thee or over thy seed, to turn thee from the Lord, who is thy God from henceforth and forever. And may the Lord God be a father to thee, and mayest thou be His first-born son, and may He be a father to thy people always. Go in peace, my son.\" And Abraham had good reason to be particularly fond of Jacob, for it was due to the merits of his grandson that he had been rescued from the fiery furnace. Isaac and Rebekah, knowing of Abraham's love for their young son, sent their father a meal by Jacob on the last Feast of Pentecost which Abraham was permitted to celebrate on earth, that he might eat and bless the Creator of all things before he died. Abraham knew that his end was approaching, and he thanked the Lord for all the good He had granted him during the days of his life, and blessed Jacob and bade him walk in the ways of the Lord, and especially he was not to marry a daughter of the Canaanites. Then Abraham prepared for death. He placed two of Jacob's fingers upon his eyes, and thus holding them closed he fell into his eternal sleep, while Jacob lay beside him on the bed. The lad did not know of his grandfather's death, until he called him, on awakening next morning, \"Father, father,\" and received no answer.",

      "title": "The Sale Of The Birthright",
      "content": "Though Abraham reached a good old age, beyond the limit of years vouchsafed later generations, he yet died five years before his allotted time. The intention was to let him live to be one hundred and eighty years old, the same age as Isaac's at his death, but on account of Esau God brought his life to an abrupt close. For some time Esau had been pursuing his evil inclinations in secret. Finally he dropped his mask, and on the day of Abraham's death he was guilty of five crimes: he ravished a betrothed maiden, committed murder, doubted the resurrection of the dead, scorned the birthright, and denied God. Then the Lord said: \"I promised Abraham that he should go to his fathers in peace. Can I now permit him to be a witness of his grandson's rebellion against God, his violation of the laws of chastity, and his shedding of blood? It is better for him to die now in peace.\" The men slain by Esau on this day were Nimrod and two of his adjutants. A long-standing feud had existed between Esau and Nimrod, because the mighty hunter before the Lord was jealous of Esau, who also devoted himself assiduously to the chase. Once when he was hunting it happened that Nimrod was separated from his people, only two men were with him. Esau, who lay in ambush, noticed his isolation, and waited until he should pass his covert. Then he threw himself upon Nimrod suddenly, and felled him and his two companions, who hastened to his succor. The outcries of the latter brought the attendants of Nimrod to the spot where he lay dead, but not before Esau had stripped him of his garments, and fled to the city with them. These garments of Nimrod had an extraordinary effect upon cattle, beasts, and birds. Of their own accord they would come and prostrate themselves before him who was arrayed in them. Thus Nimrod and Esau after him were able to rule over men and beasts. After slaying Nimrod, Esau hastened cityward in great fear of his victim's followers. Tired and exhausted he arrived at home to find Jacob busy preparing a dish of lentils. Numerous male and female slaves were in Isaac's household. Nevertheless Jacob was so simple and modest in his demeanor that, if he came home late from the Bet ha-Midrash, he would disturb none to prepare his meal, but would do it himself. On this occasion he was cooking lentils for his father, to serve to him as his mourner's meal after the death of Abraham. Adam and Eve had eaten lentils after the murder of Abel, and so had the parents of Haran, when he perished in the fiery furnace. The reason they are used for the mourner's meal is that the round lentil symbolizes death: as the lentil rolls, so death, sorrow, and mourning constantly roll about among men, from one to the other. Esau accosted Jacob thus, \"Why art thou preparing lentils?\" Jacob: \"Because our grandfather passed away; they shall be a sign of my grief and mourning, that he may love me in the days to come.\" Esau: \"Thou fool! Dost thou really think it possible that man should come to life again after he has been dead and has mouldered in the grave?\" He continued to taunt Jacob. \"Why dost thou give thyself so much trouble?\" he said. \"Lift up thine eyes, and thou wilt see that all men eat whatever comes to hand—fish, creeping and crawling creatures, swine's flesh, and all sorts of things like these, and thou vexest thyself about a dish of lentils.\" Jacob: \"If we act like other men, what shall we do on the day of the Lord, the day on which the pious will receive their reward, when a herald will proclaim: Where is He that weigheth the deeds of men, where is He that counteth?\" Esau: \"Is there a future world? Or will the dead be called back to life? If it were so, why hath not Adam returned? Hast thou heard that Noah, through whom the world was raised anew, hath reappeared? Yea, Abraham, the friend of God, more beloved of Him than any man, hath he come to life again?\" Jacob: \"If thou art of opinion that there is no future world, and that the dead do not rise to new life, then why dost thou want thy birthright? Sell it to me, now, while it is yet possible to do so. Once the Torah is revealed, it cannot be done. Verily, there is a future world, in which the righteous receive their reward. I tell thee this, lest thou say later I deceived thee.\" Jacob was little concerned about the double share of the inheritance that went with the birthright. What he thought of was the priestly service, which was the prerogative of the first-born in ancient times, and Jacob was loth to have his impious brother Esau play the priest, he who despised all Divine service. The scorn manifested by Esau for the resurrection of the dead he felt also for the promise of God to give the Holy Land to the seed of Abraham. He did not believe in it, and therefore he was willing to cede his birthright and the blessing attached thereto in exchange for a mess of pottage. In addition, Jacob paid him in coin, and, besides, he gave him what was more than money, the wonderful sword of Methuselah, which Isaac had inherited from Abraham and bestowed upon Jacob. Esau made game of Jacob. He invited his associates to feast at his brother's table, saying, \"Know ye what I did to this Jacob? I ate his lentils, drank his wine, amused myself at his expense, and sold my birthright to him.\" All that Jacob replied was, \"Eat and may it do thee good!\" But the Lord said, \"Thou despisest the birthright, therefore I shall make thee despised in all generations.\" And by way of punishment for denying God and the resurrection of the dead, the descendants of Esau were cut off from the world. As naught was holy to Esau, Jacob made him swear, concerning the birthright, by the life of their father, for he knew Esau's love for Isaac, that it was strong. Nor did he fail to have a document made out, duly signed by witnesses, setting forth that Esau had sold him the birthright together with his claim upon a place in the Cave of Machpelah. Though no blame can attach to Jacob for all this, yet he secured the birthright from him by cunning, and therefore the descendants of Jacob had to serve the descendants of Esau.",

      "title": "Isaac With The Philistines",
      "content": "The life of Isaac was a faithful reflex of the life of his father. Abraham had to leave his birthplace; so also Isaac. Abraham was exposed to the risk of losing his wife; so also Isaac. The Philistines were envious of Abraham; so also of Isaac. Abraham long remained childless; so also Isaac. Abraham begot one pious son and one wicked son; so also Isaac. And, finally, as in the time of Abraham, so also in the time of Isaac, a famine came upon the land. At first Isaac intended to follow the example of his father and remove to Egypt, but God appeared unto him, and spake: \"Thou art a perfect sacrifice, without a blemish, and as a burnt offering is made unfit if it is taken outside of the sanctuary, so thou wouldst be profaned if thou shouldst happen outside of the Holy Land. Remain in the land, and endeavor to cultivate it. In this land dwells the Shekinah, and in days to come I will give unto thy children the realms possessed by mighty rulers, first a part thereof, and the whole in the Messianic time.\" Isaac obeyed the command of God, and he settled in Gerar. When he noticed that the inhabitants of the place began to have designs upon his wife, he followed the example of Abraham, and pretended she was his sister. The report of Rebekah's beauty reached the king himself, but he was mindful of the great danger to which he had once exposed himself on a similar occasion, and he left Isaac and his wife unmolested. After they had been in Gerar for three months, Abimelech noticed that the manner of Isaac, who lived in the outer court of the royal palace, was that of a husband toward Rebekah. He called him to account, saying, \"It might have happened to the king himself to take the woman thou didst call thy sister.\" Indeed, Isaac lay under the suspicion of having illicit intercourse with Rebekah, for at first the people of the place would not believe that she was his wife. When Isaac persisted in his statement, Abimelech sent his grandees for them, ordered them to be arrayed in royal vestments, and had it proclaimed before them, as they rode through the city: \"These two are man and wife. He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.\" Thereafter the king invited Isaac to settle in his domains, and he assigned fields and vineyards to him for cultivation, the best the land afforded. But Isaac was not self-interested. The tithe of all he possessed he gave to the poor of Gerar. Thus he was the first to introduce the law of tithing for the poor, as his father Abraham had been the first to separate the priests' portion from his fortune. Isaac was rewarded by abundant harvests; the land yielded a hundred times more than was expected, though the soil was barren and the year unfruitful. He grew so rich that people wished to have \"the dung from Isaac's she-mules rather than Abimelech's gold and silver.\" But his wealth called forth the envy of the Philistines, for it is characteristic of the wicked that they begrudge their fellow-men the good, and rejoice when they see evil descend upon them, and envy brings hatred in its wake, and so the Philistines first envied Isaac, and then hated him. In their enmity toward him, they stopped the wells which Abraham had had his servants dig. Thus they broke their covenant with Abraham and were faithless, and they have only themselves to blame if they were exterminated later on by the Israelites. Isaac departed from Gerar, and began to dig again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father, and which the Philistines had stopped. His reverence for his father was so great that he even restored the names by which Abraham had called the wells. To reward him for his filial respect, the Lord left the name of Isaac unchanged, while his father and his son had to submit to new names. After four attempts to secure water, Isaac was successful; he found the well of water that followed the Patriarchs. Abraham had obtained it after three diggings. Hence the name of the well, Beer-sheba, \"the well of seven diggings,\" the same well that will supply water to Jerusalem and its environs in the Messianic time. Isaac's success with his wells but served to increase the envy of the Philistines, for he had come upon water in a most unlikely spot and, besides, in a year of drouth. But \"the Lord fulfils the desire of them that fear Him.\" As Isaac executed the will of his Creator, so God accomplished his desire. And Abimelech, the king of Gerar, speedily came to see that God was on the side of Isaac, for, to chastise him for having instigated Isaac's removal from Gerar, his house was ravaged by robbers in the night, and he himself was stricken with leprosy. The wells of the Philistines ran dry as soon as Isaac left Gerar, and also the trees failed to yield their fruit. None could be in doubt but that these things were the castigation for their unkindness. Now Abimelech entreated his friends, especially the administrator of his kingdom, to accompany him to Isaac and help him win back his friendship. Abimelech and the Philistines spake thus to Isaac: \"We have convinced ourselves that the Shekinah is with thee, and therefore we desire thee to renew the covenant which thy father made with us, that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we also did not touch thee.\" Isaac consented. It illustrates the character of the Philistines strikingly that they took credit unto themselves for having done him no hurt. It shows that they would have been glad to inflict harm upon him, for \"the soul of the wicked desireth evil.\" The place in which the covenant was made between Isaac and the Philistines was called Shib'ah, for two reasons, because an oath was \"sworn\" there, and as a memorial of the fact that even the heathen are bound to observe the \"seven\" Noachian laws. For all the wonders executed by God for Isaac, and all the good he enjoyed throughout his life, he is indebted to the merits of his father. For his own merits he will be rewarded in future. On the great day of judgment it will be Isaac who will redeem his descendants from Gehenna. On that day the Lord will speak to Abraham, \"Thy children have sinned,\" and Abraham will make reply, \"Then let them be wiped out, that Thy Name be sanctified.\" The Lord will turn to Jacob, thinking that he who had suffered so much in bringing his sons to manhood's estate would display more love for his posterity. But Jacob will give the same answer as Abraham. Then God will say: \"The old have no understanding, and the young no counsel. I will now go to Isaac. Isaac,\" God will address him, \"thy children have sinned,\" and Isaac will reply: \"O Lord of the world, sayest Thou my children, and not THINE? When they stood at Mount Sinai and declared themselves ready to execute all Thy bidding before even they heard it, Thou didst call Israel 'My first-born,' and now they are MY children, and not THINE! Let us consider. The years of a man are seventy. From these twenty are to be deducted, for Thou inflictest no punishment upon those under twenty. Of the fifty years that are left, one-half are to be deducted for the nights passed in sleep. There remain only twenty-five years, and these are to be diminished by twelve and a half, the time spent in praying, eating, and attending to other needs in life, during which men commit no sins. That leaves only twelve years and a half. If Thou wilt take these upon Thyself, well and good. If not, do Thou take one-half thereof, and I will take the other half.\" The descendants of Isaac will then say, \"Verily, thou art our true father!\" But he will point to God, and admonish them, \"Nay, give not your praises to me, but to God alone,\" and Israel, with eyes directed heavenward, will say, \"Thou, O Lord, art our Father; our Redeemer from everlasting is Thy name.\" It was Isaac, or, as he is sometimes called, Elihu the son of Barachel, who revealed the wonderful mysteries of nature in his arguments with Job. At the end of the years of famine, God appeared unto Isaac, and bade him return to Canaan. Isaac did as he was commanded, and he settled in Hebron. At this time he sent his younger son Jacob to the Bet ha-Midrash of Shem and Eber, to study the law of the Lord. Jacob remained there thirty-two years. As for Esau, he refused to learn, and he remained in the house of his father. The chase was his only occupation, and as he pursued beasts, so he pursued men, seeking to capture them with cunning and deceit. On one of his hunting expeditions, Esau came to Mount Seir, where he became acquainted with Judith, of the family of Ham, and he took her unto himself as his wife, and brought her to his father at Hebron. Ten years later, when Shem his teacher died, Jacob returned home, at the age of fifty. Another six years passed, and Rebekah received the joyful news that her sister-in-law 'Adinah, the wife of Laban, who, like all the women of his house, had been childless until then, had given birth to twin daughters, Leah and Rachel. Rebekah, weary of her life on account of the woman chosen by her older son, exhorted Jacob not to marry one of the daughters of Canaan, but a maiden of the family of Abraham. He assured his mother that the words of Abraham, bidding him to marry no woman of the Canaanites, were graven upon his memory, and for this reason he was still unmarried, though he had attained the age of sixty-two, and Esau had been urging him for twenty-two years past to follow his example and wed a daughter of the people of the land in which they lived. He had heard that his uncle Laban had daughters, and he was resolved to choose one of them as his wife. Deeply moved by the words of her son, Rebekah thanked him and gave praise unto God with the words: \"Blessed be the Lord God, and may His Holy Name be blessed for ever and ever, who hath given me Jacob as a pure son and a holy seed; for he is Thine, and Thine shall his seed be continually and throughout all the generations for evermore. Bless him, O Lord, and place in my mouth the blessing of righteousness, that I may bless him.\" And when the spirit of the Lord came over her, she laid her hands upon the head of Jacob and gave him her maternal blessing. It ended with the words, \"May the Lord of the world love thee, as the heart of thy affectionate mother rejoices in thee, and may He bless thee.\"",

      "content": "Esau's marriage with the daughters of the Canaanites was an abomination not only in the eyes of his mother, but also in the eyes of his father. He suffered even more than Rebekah through the idolatrous practices of his daughters in-law. It is the nature of man to oppose less resistance than woman to disagreeable circumstances. A bone is not harmed by a collision that would shiver an earthen pot in pieces. Man, who is created out of the dust of the ground, has not the endurance of woman formed out of bone. Isaac was made prematurely old by the conduct of his daughters-in-law, and he lost the sight of his eyes. Rebekah had been accustomed in the home of her childhood to the incense burnt before idols, and she could therefore bear it under her own roof-tree. Unlike her, Isaac had never had any such experience while he abode with his parents, and he was stung by the smoke arising from the sacrifices offered to their idols by his daughters-in-law in his own house. Isaac's eyes had suffered earlier in life, too. When he lay bound upon the altar, about to be sacrificed by his father, the angels wept, and their tears fell upon his eyes, and there they remained and weakened his sight. At the same time he had brought the scourge of blindness down upon himself by his love for Esau. He justified the wicked for a bribe, the bribe of Esau's filial love, and loss of vision is the punishment that follows the taking of bribes. \"A gift,\" it is said, \"blinds the eyes of the wise.\" Nevertheless his blindness proved a benefit for Isaac as well as Jacob. In consequence of his physical ailments, Isaac had to keep at home, and so he was spared the pain of being pointed out by the people as the father of the wicked Esau. And, again, if his power of vision had been unimpaired, he would not have blessed Jacob. As it was, God treated him as a physician treats a sick man who is forbidden to drink wine, for which, however, he has a strong desire. To placate him, the physician orders that warm water be given him in the dark, and he be told that it is wine. When Isaac reached the age of one hundred and twenty three, and was thus approaching the years attained by his mother, he began to meditate upon his end. It is proper that a man should prepare for death when he comes close to the age at which either of his parents passed out of life. Isaac reflected that he did not know whether the age allotted to him was his mother's or his father's, and he therefore resolved to bestow his blessing upon his older son, Esau, before death should overtake him. He summoned Esau, and he said, \"My son,\" and Esau replied, \"Here am I,\" but the holy spirit interposed: \"Though he disguises his voice and makes it sound sweet, put no confidence in him. There are seven abominations in his heart. He will destroy seven holy places—the Tabernacle, the sanctuaries at Gilgal, Shiloh, Nob, and Gibeon, and the first and the second Temple.\" Gently though Esau continued to speak to his father, he yet longed for his end to come. But Isaac was stricken with spiritual as well as physical blindness. The holy spirit deserted him, and he could not discern the wickedness of his older son. He bade him sharpen his slaughtering knives and beware of bringing him the flesh of an animal that had died of itself, or had been torn by a beast, and he was to guard also against putting an animal before Isaac that had been stolen from its rightful owner. \"Then,\" continued Isaac, \"will I bless him who is worthy of being blessed.\" This charge was laid upon Esau on the eve of the Passover, and Isaac said to him: \"To-night the whole world will sing the Hallel unto God. It is the night when the storehouses of dew are unlocked. Therefore prepare dainties for me, that my soul may bless thee before I die.\" But the holy spirit interposed, \"Eat not the bread of him that hath an evil eye.\" Isaac's longing for tidbits was due to his blindness. As the sightless cannot behold the food they eat, they do not enjoy it with full relish, and their appetite must be tempted with particularly palatable morsels. Esau sallied forth to procure what his father desired, little recking the whence or how, whether by robbery or theft. To hinder the quick execution of his father's order, God sent Satan on the chase with Esau. He was to delay him as long as possible. Esau would catch a deer and leave him lying bound, while he pursued other game. Immediately Satan would come and liberate the deer, and when Esau returned to the spot, his victim was not to be found. This was repeated several times. Again and again the quarry was run down, and bound, and liberated, so that Jacob was able meanwhile to carry out the plan of Rebekah whereby he would be blessed instead of Esau. Though Rebekah had not heard the words that had passed between Isaac and Esau, they nevertheless were revealed to her through the holy spirit, and she resolved to restrain her husband from taking a false step. She was not actuated by love for Jacob, but by the wish of keeping Isaac from committing a detestable act. Rebekah said to Jacob: \"This night the storehouses of dew are unlocked; it is the night during which the celestial beings chant the Hallel unto God, the night set apart for the deliverance of thy children from Egypt, on which they, too, will sing the Hallel. Go now and prepare savory meat for thy father, that he may bless thee before his death. Do as I bid thee, obey me as thou art wont, for thou art my son whose children, every one, will be good and God-fearing—not one shall be graceless.\" In spite of his great respect for his mother, Jacob refused at first to heed her command. He feared he might commit a sin, especially as he might thus bring his father's curse down upon him. As it was, Isaac might still have a blessing for him, after giving Esau his. But Rebekah allayed his anxieties, with the words: \"When Adam was cursed, the malediction fell upon his mother, the earth, and so shall I, thy mother, bear the imprecation, if thy father curses thee. Moreover, if the worst comes to the worst, I am prepared to step before thy father and tell him, 'Esau is a villain, and Jacob is a righteous man.'\" Thus constrained by his mother, Jacob, in tears and with body bowed, went off to execute the plan made by Rebekah. As he was to provide a Passover meal, she bade him get two kids, one for the Passover sacrifice and one for the festival sacrifice. To soothe Jacob's conscience, she added that her marriage contract entitled her to two kids daily. \"And,\" she continued, \"these two kids will bring good unto thee, the blessing of thy father, and they will bring good unto thy children, for two kids will be the atoning sacrifice offered on the Day of Atonement.\" Jacob's hesitation was not yet removed. His father, he feared, would touch him and convince himself that he was not hairy, and therefore not his son Esau. Accordingly, Rebekah tore the skins of the two kids into strips and sewed them together, for Jacob was so tall a giant that otherwise they would not have sufficed to cover his hands. To make Jacob's disguise complete, Rebekah felt justified in putting Esau's wonderful garments on him. They were the high priestly raiment in which God had clothed Adam, \"the first-born of the world,\" for in the days before the erection of the Tabernacle all the first-born males officiated as priests. From Adam these garments descended to Noah, who transmitted them to Shem, and Shem bequeathed them to Abraham, and Abraham to his son Isaac, from whom they reached Esau as the older of his two sons. It was the opinion of Rebekah that as Jacob had bought the birthright from his brother, he had thereby come into possession of the garments as well. There was no need for her to go and fetch them from the house of Esau. He knew his wives far too well to entrust so precious a treasure to them; they were in the safe-keeping of his mother. Besides, he used them most frequently in the house of his parents. As a rule, he did not lay much stress upon decent apparel. He was willing to appear on the street clad in rags, but he considered it his duty to wait upon his father arrayed in his best. \"My father,\" Esau was in the habit of saying, \"is a king in my sight, and it would ill become me to serve before him in any thing but royal apparel.\" To the great respect he manifested toward his father, the descendants of Esau owe all their good fortune on earth. Thus doth God reward a good deed. Rebekah led Jacob equipped and arrayed in this way to the door of Isaac's chamber. There she parted from him with the words, \"Henceforward may thy Creator assist thee.\" Jacob entered, addressing Isaac with \"Father,\" and receiving the response, \"Here am I! Who art thou, my son?\" he replied equivocally, \"It is I, thy first-born son is Esau.\" He sought to avoid a falsehood, and yet not betray that he was Jacob. Isaac then said: \"Thou art greatly in haste to secure thy blessing. Thy father Abraham was seventy-five years old when he was blessed, and thou art but sixty-three.\" Jacob replied awkwardly, \"Because the Lord thy God sent me good speed.\" Isaac concluded at once that this was not Esau, for he would not have mentioned the name of God, and he made up his mind to feel the son before him and make sure who he was. Terror seized upon Jacob at the words of Isaac, \"Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son.\" A cold sweat covered his body, and his heart melted like wax. Then God caused the archangels Michael and Gabriel to descend. The one seized his right hand, the other his left hand, while the Lord God Himself supported him, that his courage might not fail him. Isaac felt him, and, finding his hands hairy, he said, \"The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau,\" words in which he conveyed the prophecy that so long as the voice of Jacob is heard in the houses of prayer and of learning, the hands of Esau will not be able to prevail against him. \"Yes,\" he continued, \"it is the voice of Jacob, the voice that imposes silence upon those on earth and in heaven,\" for even the angels may not raise their voices in praise of God until Israel has finished his prayers. Isaac's scruples about blessing the son before him were not yet removed, for with his prophetical eye he foresaw that this one would have descendants who would vex the Lord. At the same time, it was revealed to him that even the sinners in Israel would turn penitents, and then he was ready to bless Jacob. He bade him come near and kiss him, to indicate that it would be Jacob who would imprint the last kiss upon Isaac before he was consigned to the grave—he and none other. When Jacob stood close to him, he discerned the fragrance of Paradise clinging to him, and he exclaimed, \"See, the smell of my son is as the smell of the field which the Lord hath blessed.\" The fragrance emanating from Jacob was not the only thing about him derived from Paradise. The archangel Michael had fetched thence the wine which Jacob gave his father to drink, that an exalted mood might descend upon him, for only when a man is joyously excited the Shekinah rests upon him. The holy spirit filled Isaac, and he gave Jacob his tenfold blessing: \"God give thee of the dew of heaven,\" the celestial dew wherewith God will awaken the pious to new life in days to come; \"and of the fatness of the earth,\" the goods of this world; \"and plenty of corn and wine,\" the Torah and the commandments which bestow the same joy upon man as abundant harvests; \"peoples shall serve thee,\" the Japhethites and the Hamites; \"nations shall bow down to thee,\" the Shemite nations; \"thou wilt be lord over thy brethren,\" the Ishmaelites and the descendants of Keturah; \"thy mother's sons will bow down to thee,\" Esau and his princes; \"cursed be every one that curseth thee,\" like Balaam; \"and blessed be every one that blesseth thee,\" like Moses. For each blessing invoked upon Jacob by his father Isaac, a similar blessing was bestowed upon him by God Himself in the same words. As Isaac blessed him with dew, so also God: \"And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples as dew from the Lord.\" Isaac blessed him with the fatness of the earth, so also God: \"And he shall give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the ground, and it shall be fat and plenteous.\" Isaac blessed him with plenty of corn and wine, so also God: \"I will send you corn and wine.\" Isaac said, \"Peoples shall serve thee,\" so also God: \"Kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their faces to the earth, and lick the dust of thy feet.\" Isaac said, \"Nations shall bow down to thee,\" so also God: \"And He will make thee high above all nations which He hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honor.\" To this double blessing his mother Rebekah joined hers: \"For He shall give His angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy feet against a stone. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder; the young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample under feet. Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him; I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.\" The holy spirit added in turn: \"He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honor him. With long life will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation.\" Jacob left the presence of his father crowned like a bridegroom, adorned like a bride, and bathed in celestial dew, which filled his bones with marrow, and transformed him into a hero and a giant. Of a miracle done for him at that very moment Jacob himself was not aware. Had he tarried with his father an instant longer, Esau would have met him there, and would surely have slain him. It happened that exactly as Jacob was on the point of leaving the tent of his father, carrying in his hands the plates off which Isaac had eaten, he noticed Esau approaching, and he concealed himself behind the door. Fortunately, it was a revolving door, so that though he could see Esau, he could not be seen by him.",

      "title": "Esau's True Character Revealed",
      "content": "Esau arrived after a delay of four hours. In spite of all the efforts he had put forth, he had not succeeded in catching any game, and he was compelled to kill a dog and prepare its flesh for his father's meal. All this had made Esau ill-humored, and when he bade his father partake of the meal, the invitation sounded harsh. \"Let my father arise,\" he said, \"and eat of his son's venison.\" Jacob had spoken differently; he had said, \"Arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison.\" The words of Esau terrified Isaac greatly. His fright exceeded that which he had felt when his father was about to offer him as a sacrifice, and he cried out, \"Who then is he that hath been the mediator between me and the Lord, to make the blessing reach Jacob?\"—words meant to imply that he suspected Rebekah of having instigated Jacob's act. Isaac's alarm was caused by his seeing hell at the feet of Esau. Scarcely had he entered the house when the walls thereof began to get hot on account of the nearness of hell, which he brought along with him. Isaac could not but exclaim, \"Who will be burnt down yonder, I or my son Jacob?\" and the Lord answered him, \"Neither thou nor Jacob, but the hunter.\" Isaac told Esau that the meat set before him by Jacob had had marvellous qualities. Any savor that one desired it possessed, it was even endowed with the taste of the food that God will grant the pious in the world to come. \"I know not,\" he said, \"what the meat was. But I had only to wish for bread, and it tasted like bread, or fish, or locusts, or flesh of animals, in short, it had the taste of any dainty one could wish for.\" When Esau heard the word \"flesh,\" he began to weep, and he said: \"To me Jacob gave no more than a dish of lentils, and in payment for it he took my birthright. What must he have taken from thee for flesh of animals?\" Hitherto Isaac had been in great anguish on account of the thought that he had committed a wrong in giving his blessing to his younger son instead of the first-born, to whom it belonged by law and custom. But when he heard that Jacob had acquired the birthright from Esau, he said, \"I gave my blessing to the right one!\" In his dismay, Isaac had had the intention of cursing Jacob for having wrested the blessing from him through cunning. God prevented him from carrying out his plan. He reminded him that he would but curse himself, seeing that his blessing contained the words, \"Cursed be every one that curseth thee.\" But Isaac was not willing to acknowledge his blessing valid as applied to Jacob, until he was informed that his second son was the possessor of the birthright. Only then did he say, \"Yea, he shall be blessed,\" whereat Esau cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry. By way of punishment for having been the cause of such distress, a descendant of Jacob, Mordecai, was also made to cry with a loud and bitter cry, and his grief was brought forth by the Amalekite Haman, the descendant of Esau. At the words of Isaac, \"Thy brother came with wisdom, and hath taken away thy blessing,\" Esau spat out in vexation, and said, \"He took away my birthright, and I kept silence, and now that he takes away my blessing, should I also keep silence? Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times.\" Isaac continued to speak to Esau: \"Behold, I have made him thy lord, he is thy king, and do what thou wilt, thy blessings will still belong to him; all his brethren have I given to him for slaves, and what slaves possess belongs to their owner. There is nothing for it, thou must be content that thou wilt receive thy bread baked from thy master.\" The Lord took it ill of Isaac that he cheered him with such kind words. \"To Mine enemy,\" He reproached him, \"thou sayest, 'What shall I do for thee, my son?'\" Isaac replied, \"O that he might find grace with Thee!\" God: \"He is a recreant.\" Isaac: \"Doth he not act righteously when he honors his parents?\" God: \"In the land of uprightness will he deal wrongfully, he will stretch his hand forth in days to come against the Temple.\" Isaac: \"Then let him enjoy much good in this world, that he may not behold the abiding-place of the Lord in the world to come.\" When it became plain to Esau that he could not induce his father to annul the blessing bestowed upon Jacob, he tried to force a blessing for himself by an underhand trick. He said: \"Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father, else it will be said thou hast but one blessing to bestow. Suppose both Jacob and I had been righteous men, had not then thy God had two blessings, one for each?\" The Lord Himself made reply: \"Silence! Jacob will bless the twelve tribes, and each blessing will be different from every other.\" But Isaac felt great pity for his older son, and he wanted to bless him, but the Shekinah forsook him, and he could not carry out what he purposed. Thereupon Esau began to weep. He shed three tears—one ran from his right eye, the second from his left eye, and the third remained hanging from his eyelash. God said, \"This villain cries for his very life, and should I let him depart empty-handed?\" and then He bade Isaac bless his older son. The blessing of Isaac ran thus: \"Behold, of the fat of the earth shall be thy dwelling,\" by which he meant Greater Greece, in Italy; \"and of the dew of heaven from above,\" referring to Bet-Gubrin; \"and by thy sword shalt thou live, and thou shalt serve thy brother,\" but when he casts off the yoke of the Lord, then shalt thou \"shake his yoke from off thy neck,\" and thou wilt be his master. The blessing which Isaac gave to his older son was bound to no condition whatsoever. Whether he deserved them or not, Esau was to enjoy the goods of this world. Jacob's blessing, however, depended upon his pious deeds; through them he would have a just claim upon earthly prosperity. Isaac thought: \"Jacob is a righteous man, he will not murmur against God, though it should come to pass that suffering be inflicted upon him in spite of his upright life. But that reprobate Esau, if he should do a good deed, or pray to God and not be heard, he would say, 'As I pray to the idols for naught, so it is in vain to pray to God.'\" For this reason did Isaac bestow an unconditional blessing upon Esau.",

      "title": "Jacob Leaves His Father's House",
      "content": "Esau hated his brother Jacob on account of the blessing that his father had given him, and Jacob was very much afraid of his brother Esau, and he fled to the house of Eber, the son of Shem, and he concealed himself there fourteen years on account of his brother Esau, and he continued there to learn the ways of the Lord and His commandments. When Esau saw that Jacob had fled and escaped from him, and Jacob had cunningly obtained the blessing, then Esau grieved exceedingly, and he was also vexed at his father and mother. He also rose up and took his wife, and went away from his father and mother to the land of Seir. There he married his second wife, Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and he called her name Adah, saying that the blessing had in that time passed from him. After dwelling in Seir for six months, Esau returned to the land of Canaan, and placed his two wives in his father's house in Hebron. And the wives of Esau vexed and provoked Isaac and Rebekah with their works, for they walked not in the ways of the Lord, but served their fathers' gods of wood and stone, as their fathers had taught them, and they were more wicked than their fathers. They sacrificed and burnt incense to the Baalim, and Isaac and Rebekah became weary of them. And at the end of fourteen years of Jacob's residing in the house of Eber, Jacob desired to see his father and his mother, and he returned home. Esau had forgotten in those days what Jacob had done to him, in having taken the blessing from him, but when Esau saw Jacob returning to his parents, he remembered what Jacob had done to him, and he was greatly incensed against him, and he sought to slay him. But Esau would not kill Jacob while his father was yet alive, lest Isaac beget another son. He wanted to be sure of being the only heir. However, his hatred against Jacob was so great that he determined to hasten the death of his father and then dispatch Jacob. Such murderous plans Esau cherished in his heart, though he denied that he was harboring them. But God spoke, \"Probably thou knowest not that I examine the hearts of men, for I am the Lord that searcheth the heart.\" And not God alone knew the secret desires of Esau. Rebekah, like all the Mothers, was a prophetess, and she delayed not to warn Jacob of the danger that hung over him. \"Thy brother,\" she said to him, \"is as sure of accomplishing his wicked purpose as though thou wert dead. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother, to Haran, and tarry with him for seven years, until thy brother's fury turn away.\" In the goodness of her heart, Rebekah could not but believe that the anger of Esau was only a fleeting passion, and would disappear in the course of time. But she was mistaken, his hate persisted until the end of his life. Courageous as he was, Jacob would not run away from danger. He said to his mother, \"I am not afraid; if he wishes to kill me, I will kill him,\" to which she replied, \"Let me not be bereaved of both my sons in one day.\" By words Rebekah again showed her prophetic gift. As she spoke, so it happened—when their time came, Esau was slain while the burial of Jacob was taking place. And Jacob said to Rebekah: \"Behold, thou knowest that my father has become old and does not see, and if I leave him and go away, he will be angry and will curse me. I will not go; if he sends me, only then will I go.\" Accordingly, Rebekah went to Isaac, and amid tears she spoke to him thus: \"If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, what good shall my life do me?\" And Isaac called Jacob, and charged him, and said unto him: \"Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan, for thus did our father Abraham command us according to the word of the Lord, which He had commanded him, saying, 'Unto thy seed will I give the land; if thy children keep My covenant that I have made with thee, then will I also perform to thy children that which I have spoken unto thee, and I will not forsake them.' Now therefore, my son, hearken to my voice, to all that I shall command thee, and refrain from taking a wife from amongst the daughters of Canaan. Arise, go to Haran, to the house of Bethuel, thy mother's father, and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban, thy mother's brother. Take heed lest thou shouldst forget the Lord thy God and all His ways in the land to which thou goest, and shouldst join thyself to the people of the land, and pursue vanity, and forsake the Lord thy God. But when thou comest to the land, serve the Lord. Do not turn to the right or to the left from the way which I commanded thee, and which thou didst learn. And may the Almighty God grant thee favor before the people of the land, that thou mayest take a wife there according to thy choice, one who is good and upright in the way of the Lord. And may God give unto thee and thy seed the blessing of thy father Abraham and make thee fruitful and multiply thee, and mayest thou become a multitude of people in the land whither thou goest, and may God cause thee to return to thy land, the land of thy father's dwelling, with children and with great riches, with joy and with pleasure.\" As the value of a document is attested by its concluding words, the signature of the witnesses, so Isaac confirmed the blessing he had bestowed upon Jacob. That none might say Jacob had secured it by intrigue and cunning, he blessed him again with three blessings, in these words, \"In so far as I am endowed with the power of blessing, I bestow blessing upon thee. May God, with whom there is endless blessing, give thee His, and also the blessing wherewith Abraham desired to bless me, desisting only in order not to provoke the jealousy of Ishmael.\" Seeing with his prophetic eye that the seed of Jacob would once be compelled to go into exile, Isaac offered up one more petition, that God would bring the exiles back again. He said, \"He shall deliver thee in six troubles, and in the seventh there shall no evil touch thee.\" And also Rebekah prayed to God in behalf of Jacob: \"O Lord of the world, let not the purpose prosper which Esau harbors against Jacob. Put a bridle upon him, that he accomplish not all he wills to do.\" When Esau observed that even his father's love had passed from him to Jacob, he went away, to Ishmael, and he addressed him as follows: \"Lo, as thy father gave all his possessions to thy brother Isaac, and dismissed thee with empty hands, so my father purposeth to do to me. Make thyself ready then, go forth and slay thy brother, and I will slay mine, and then we two shall divide the whole world between us.\" And Ishmael replied: \"Why dost thou want me to slay thy father? thou canst do it thyself.\" Esau said: \"It hath happened aforetime that a man killed his brother—Cain murdered Abel. But that a son should kill his father is unheard of.\" Esau did not really shrink back from parricide, only it chanced not to fit the plan he had hatched. \"If Ishmael slays my father,\" he said to himself, \"I am the rightful redeemer, and I shall kill Ishmael to avenge my father, and if, then, I murder Jacob, too, everything will belong to me, as the heir of my father and my uncle.\" This shows that Esau's marriage with Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael and grandchild of Abraham, was not concluded out of regard for his parents, who were opposed to his two other wives, daughters of the Canaanites. All he desired was to enter into amicable relations with Ishmael in order to execute his devilish plan. But Esau reckoned without his host. The night before his wedding with Mahalath Ishmael died, and Nebaioth, the son of Ishmael, stepped into his father's place, and gave away his sister. How little it had been in Esau's mind to make his parents happy by taking a granddaughter of Abraham to wife, appears from the fact that he kept his two other wives, the Canaanitish women. The daughter of Ishmael followed the example of her companions, and thus she but added to the grief caused the parents of Esau by their daughters-in-law. And the opportunity might have been a most favorable one for Esau to turn aside from his godless ways and amend his conduct, for the bridegroom is pardoned on his wedding day for all his sins committed in years gone by. Scarcely had Jacob left his father's house, when Rebekah began to weep, for she was sorely distressed about him. Isaac comforted her, saying: \"Weep not for Jacob! In peace doth he depart, and in peace will he return. The Lord, God Most High, will guard him against all evil and be with him. He will not forsake him all the days of his life. Have no fear for him, for he walketh on the right path, he is a perfect man, and he hath faith in God—he will not perish.\"",

      "title": "Jacob Pursued By Eliphaz And Esau",
      "content": "When Jacob went away to go to Haran, Esau called his son Eliphaz, and secretly spoke unto him, saying: \"Now hasten, take thy sword in thy hand and pursue Jacob, and pass before him in the road, and lurk for him and slay him with thy sword in one of the mountains, and take all belonging unto him, and come back.\" And Eliphaz was dexterous and expert with the bow, as his father had taught him, and he was a noted hunter in the field and a valiant man. And Eliphaz did as his father had commanded him. And Eliphaz was at that time thirteen years old, and he arose and went and took ten of his mother's brothers with him, and pursued Jacob. And he followed Jacob closely, and when he overtook him, he lay in ambush for him on the borders of the land of Canaan, opposite to the city of Shechem. And Jacob saw Eliphaz and his men pursuing after him, and Jacob stood in the place in which he was going in order to know what it was, for he did not understand their purpose. Eliphaz drew his sword and went on advancing, he and his men, toward Jacob, and Jacob said unto them, \"Wherefore have you come hither, and why do you pursue with your swords?\" Eliphaz came near to Jacob, and answered as follows, \"Thus did my father command me, and now therefore I will not deviate from the orders which my father gave me.\" And when Jacob saw that Esau had impressed his command urgently upon Eliphaz, he approached and supplicated Eliphaz and his men, saying, \"Behold, all that I have, and that which my father and mother gave unto me, that take unto thee and go from me, and do not slay me, and may this thing that thou wilt do with me be accounted unto thee as righteousness.\" And the Lord caused Jacob to find favor in the sight of Eliphaz and his men, and they hearkened to the voice of Jacob, and they did not put him to death, but took all his belongings, together with the silver and gold that he had brought with him from Beer-sheba. They left him nothing. When Eliphaz and his men returned to Esau, and told him all that had happened to them with Jacob, he was wroth with his son Eliphaz and with his men, because they had not put Jacob to death. And they answered, and said unto Esau, \"Because Jacob supplicated us in this matter, not to slay him, our pity was moved toward him, and we took all belonging to him, and we came back.\" Esau then took all the silver and gold which Eliphaz had taken from Jacob, and he put them by in his house. Nevertheless Esau did not give up the hope of intercepting Jacob on his flight and slaying him. He pursued him, and with his men occupied the road along which he had to journey to Haran. There a great miracle happened to Jacob. When he observed what Esau's intention was, he turned off toward the Jordan river, and, with eyes directed to God, he cleft the waters with his wanderer's staff, and succeeded in crossing to the other side. But Esau was not to be deterred. He kept up the pursuit, and reached the hot springs at Baarus before his brother, who had to pass by there. Jacob, not knowing that Esau was on the watch for him, decided to bathe in the spring, saying, \"I have neither bread nor other things needful, so I will at least warm my body in the waters of the well.\" While he was in the bath, Esau occupied every exit, and Jacob would surely have perished in the hot water, if the Lord had not caused a miracle to come to pass. A new opening formed of itself, and through it Jacob escaped. Thus were fulfilled the words, \"When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burnt,\" for Jacob was saved from the waters of the Jordan and from the fire of the hot spring. At the same time with Jacob, a rider, leaving his horse and his clothes on the shore, had stepped into the river to cool off, but he was overwhelmed by the waves, and he met his death. Jacob put on the dead man's clothes, mounted his horse, and went off. It was a lucky chance, for Eliphaz had stripped him of everything, even his clothes, and the miracle of the river had happened only that he might not be forced to appear naked among men. Though Jacob was robbed of all his possessions, his courage did not fail him. He said: \"Should I lose hope in my Creator? I set my eyes upon the merits of my fathers. For the sake of them the Lord will give me His aid.\" And God said: \"Jacob, thou puttest thy trust in the merits of thy fathers, therefore I will not suffer thy foot to be moved; He that keepeth thee will not slumber. Yea, still more! While a keeper watcheth only by day as a rule, and sleepeth by night, I will guard thee day and night, for, behold, He that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord will keep thee from all evil, from Esau as well as Laban; He will keep thy soul, that the Angel of Death do thee no hurt; He will keep thy going out and thy coming in, He will support thee now thou art leaving Canaan, and when thou returnest to Canaan.\" Jacob was reluctant to leave the Holy Land before he received direct permission from God. \"My parents,\" he reflected, \"bade me go forth and sojourn outside of the land, but who knows whether it be the will of God that I do as they say, and beget children outside of the Holy Land?\" Accordingly, he betook himself to Beer-sheba. There, where the Lord had given permission to Isaac to depart from Canaan and go to Philistia, he would learn the will of the Lord concerning himself. He did not follow the example of his father and grandfather and take refuge with Abimelech, because he feared the king might force also him into a covenant, and make it impossible for his descendants of many generations to take possession of the Philistine land. Nor could he stay at home, because of his fear that Esau might wrest the birthright and the blessing from him, and to that he would not and could not agree. He was as little disposed to take up the combat with Esau, for he knew the truth of the maxim, \"He who courts danger will be overcome by it; he who avoids danger will overcome it.\" Both Abraham and Isaac had lived according to this rule. His grandfather had fled from Nimrod, and his father had gone away from the Philistines.",

      "content": "Jacob's journey to Haran was a succession of miracles. The first of the five that befell for his sake in the course of it was that the sun sank while Jacob was passing Mount Moriah, though it was high noon at the time. He was following the spring that appeared wherever the Patriarchs went or settled. It accompanied Jacob from Beer-sheba to Mount Moriah, a two days' journey. When he arrived at the holy hill, the Lord said to him: \"Jacob, thou hast bread in thy wallet, and the spring of waters is near by to quench thy thirst. Thus thou hast food and drink, and here thou canst lodge for the night.\" But Jacob replied: \"The sun has barely passed the fifth of its twelve day stages, why should I lie down to sleep at so unseemly an hour?\" But then Jacob perceived that the sun was about to sink, and he prepared to make ready his bed. It was the Divine purpose not to let Jacob pass the site of the future Temple without stopping; he was to tarry there at least one night. Also, God desired to appear unto Jacob, and He shows Himself unto His faithful ones only at night. At the same time Jacob was saved from the pursuit of Esau, who had to desist on account of the premature darkness. Jacob took twelve stones from the altar on which his father Isaac had lain bound as a sacrifice, and he said: \"It was the purpose of God to let twelve tribes arise, but they have not been begotten by Abraham or Isaac. If, now, these twelve stones will unite into a single one, then shall I know for a certainty that I am destined to become the father of the twelve tribes.\" At this time the second miracle came to pass, the twelve stones joined themselves together and made one, which he put under his head, and at once it became soft and downy like a pillow. It was well that he had a comfortable couch. He was in great need of rest, for it was the first night in fourteen years that he did not keep vigils. During all those years, passed in Eber's house of learning, he had devoted the nights to study. And for twenty years to come he was not to sleep, for while he was with his uncle Laban, he spent all the night and every night reciting the Psalms. On the whole it was a night of marvels. He dreamed a dream in which the course of the world's history was unfolded to him. On a ladder set up on the earth, with the top of it reaching to heaven, he beheld the two angels who had been sent to Sodom. For one hundred and thirty-eight years they had been banished from the celestial regions, because they had betrayed their secret mission to Lot. They had accompanied Jacob from his father's house thither, and now they were ascending heavenward. When they arrived there, he heard them call the other angels, and say, \"Come ye and see the countenance of the pious Jacob, whose likeness appears on the Divine throne, ye who yearned long to see it,\" and then he beheld the angels descend from heaven to gaze upon him. He also saw the angels of the four kingdoms ascending the ladder. The angel of Babylon mounted seventy rounds, the angel of Media, fifty-two, that of Greece, one hundred and eighty, and that of Edom mounted very high, saying, \"I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High,\" and Jacob heard a voice remonstrating, \"Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the uttermost parts of the pit.\" God Himself reproved Edom, saying, \"Though thou mount on high as the eagle, and though thy nest be set among the stars, I will bring thee down from thence.\" Furthermore, God showed unto Jacob the revelation at Mount Sinai, the translation of Elijah, the Temple in its glory and in its spoliation, Nebuchadnezzar's attempt to burn the three holy children in the fiery furnace, and Daniel's encounter with Bel. In this, the first prophetic dream dreamed by Jacob, God made him the promise that the land upon which he was lying would be given to him, but the land he lay upon was the whole of Palestine, which God had folded together and put under him. \"And,\" the promise continued, \"thy seed will be like unto the dust of the earth. As the earth survives all things, so thy children will survive all the nations of the earth. But as the earth is trodden upon by all, so thy children, when they commit trespasses, will be trodden upon by the nations of the earth.\" And, furthermore, God promised that Jacob should spread out to the west and to the east, a greater promise than that given to his fathers Abraham and Isaac, to whom He had allotted a limited land. Jacob's was an unbounded possession. From this wondrous dream Jacob awoke with a start of fright, on account of the vision he had had of the destruction of the Temple. He cried out, \"How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, wherein is the gate of heaven through which prayer ascends to Him.\" He took the stone made out of the twelve, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it, which had flowed down from heaven for him, and God sank this anointed stone unto the abyss, to serve as the centre of the earth, the same stone, the Eben Shetiyah, that forms the centre of the sanctuary, whereon the Ineffable Name is graven, the knowledge of which makes a man master over nature, and over life and death. Jacob cast himself down before the Eben Shetiyah, and entreated God to fulfil the promise He had given him, and also he prayed that God grant him honorable sustenance. For God had not mentioned bread to eat and raiment to put on, that Jacob might learn to have faith in the Lord. Then he vowed to give the tenth of all he owned unto God, if He would but grant his petition. Thus Jacob was the first to take a vow upon himself, and the first, too, to separate the tithe from his income. God had promised him almost all that is desirable, but he feared he might forfeit the pledged blessings through his sinfulness, and again he prayed earnestly that God bring him back to his father's house unimpaired in body, possessions, and knowledge, and guard him, in the strange land whither he was going, against idolatry, an immoral life, and bloodshed. His prayer at an end, Jacob set out on his way to Haran, and the third wonder happened. In the twinkling of an eye he arrived at his destination. The earth jumped from Mount Moriah to Haran. A wonder like this God has executed only four times in the whole course of history. The first thing to meet his eye in Haran was the well whence the inhabitants drew their supply of water. Although it was a great city, Haran suffered from dearth of water, and therefore the well could not be used by the people free of charge. Jacob's sojourn in the city produced a change. By reason of his meritorious deeds the water springs were blessed, and the city had water enough for its needs. Jacob saw a number of people by the well, and he questioned them, \"My brethren, whence be ye?\" He thus made himself a model for all to follow. A man should be companionable, and address others like brothers and friends, and not wait for them to greet him. Each one should strive to be the first to give the salutation of peace, that the angels of peace and compassion may come to meet him. When he was informed that the by-standers hailed from Haran, he made inquiry about the character and vocation of his uncle Laban, and whether they were on terms of friendly intercourse with him. They answered briefly: \"There is peace between us, but if thou art desirous of inquiring further, here comes Rachel the daughter of Laban. From her thou canst learn all thou hast a mind to learn.\" They knew that women like to talk, wherefore they referred him to Rachel. Jacob found it strange that so many should be standing idle by the well, and he questioned further: \"Are you day laborers? then it is too early for you to put by your work. But if you are pasturing your own sheep, why do you not water your flocks and let them feed?\" They told him they were waiting until all the shepherds brought their flocks thither, and together rolled the stone from the mouth of the well. While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for Laban had no sons, and a pest having broken out shortly before among his cattle, so few sheep were left that a maiden like Rachel could easily tend them. Now, when Jacob saw the daughter of his mother's brother approaching, he rolled the great stone from the mouth of the well as easily as a cork is drawn from a bottle—the fourth wonder of this extraordinary day. Jacob's strength was equal to the strength of all the shepherds; with his two arms alone he accomplished what usually requires the united forces of a large assemblage of men. He had been divinely endowed with this supernatural strength on leaving the Holy Land. God had caused the dew of the resurrection to drop down upon him, and his physical strength was so great that even in a combat with the angels he was victorious. The fifth and last wonder of the day was that the water rose from the depths of the well to the very top, there was no need to draw it up, and there it remained all the twenty years that Jacob abode in Haran.",

      "content": "Rachel's coming to the well at the moment when Jacob reached the territory belonging to Haran was an auspicious omen. To meet young maidens on first entering a city is a sure sign that fortune is favorable to one's undertakings. Experience proves this through Eliezer, Jacob, Moses, and Saul. They all encountered maidens when they approached a place new to them, and they all met with success. Jacob treated Rachel at once as his cousin, which caused significant whispering among the by-standers. They censured Jacob for his demeanor toward her, for since God had sent the deluge upon the world, on account of the immoral life led by men, great chastity had prevailed, especially among the people of the east. The talk of the men reduced Jacob to tears. Scarcely had he kissed Rachel when he began to weep, for he repented of having done it. There was reason enough for tears. Jacob could not but remember sadly that Eliezer, his grandfather's slave, had brought ten camels laden with presents with him to Haran, when he came to sue for a bride for Isaac, while he had not even a ring to give to Rachel. Moreover, he foresaw that his favorite wife Rachel would not lie beside him in the grave, and this, too, made him weep. As soon as Rachel heard that Jacob was her cousin, she ran home to tell her father about his coming. Her mother was no longer among the living, else she would naturally have gone to her. In great haste Laban ran to receive Jacob. He reflected, if Eliezer, the bondman, had come with ten camels, what would not the favorite son of the family bring with him, and when he saw that Jacob was unattended, he concluded that he carried great sums of money in his girdle, and he threw his arms about his waist to find out whether his supposition was true. Disappointed in this, he yet did not give up hope that his nephew Jacob was a man of substance. Perhaps he concealed precious stones in his mouth, and he kissed him in order to find out whether he had guessed aright. But Jacob said to him: \"Thou thinkest I have money. Nay, thou art mistaken, I have but words.\" Then he went on to tell him how it had come about that he stood before him empty-handed. He said that his father Isaac had sent him on his way provided with gold, silver, and money, but he had encountered Eliphaz, who had threatened to slay him. To this assailant Jacob had spoken thus: \"Know that the descendants of Abraham have an obligation to meet, they will have to serve four hundred years in a land that is not theirs. If thou slayest me, then you, the seed of Esau, will have to pay the debt. It were better, therefore, to take all I have, and spare my life, so that what is owing may be paid by me. Hence,\" Jacob continued, \"I stand before thee bare of all the substance carried off by Eliphaz.\" This tale of his nephew's poverty filled Laban with dismay. \"What,\" he exclaimed, \"shall I have to give food and drink for a month or, perhaps, even a year to this fellow, who has come to me empty-handed!\" He betook himself to his teraphim, to ask them for counsel upon the matter, and they admonished him, saying: \"Beware of sending him away from thy house. His star and his constellation are so lucky that good fortune will attend all his undertakings, and for his sake the blessing of the Lord will rest upon all thou doest, in thy house or in thy field.\" Laban was satisfied with the advice of the teraphim, but he was embarrassed as to the way in which he was to attach Jacob to his house. He did not venture to offer him service, lest Jacob's conditions be impossible of fulfilment. Again he resorted to the teraphim, and asked them with what reward to tempt his nephew, and they replied: \"A wife is his wage; he will ask nothing else of thee but a wife. It is his nature to be attracted by women, and whenever he threatens to leave thee, do but offer him another wife, and he will not depart.\" Laban went back to Jacob, and said, \"Tell me, what shall thy wages be?\" and he replied, \"Thinkest thou I came hither to make money? I came only to get me a wife,\" for Jacob had no sooner beheld Rachel than he fell in love with her and made her a proposal of marriage. Rachel consented, but added the warning: \"My father is cunning, and thou art not his match.\" Jacob: \"I am his brother in cunning.\" Rachel: \"But is deception becoming unto the pious?\" Jacob: \"Yes, 'with the righteous righteousness is seemly, and with the deceiver deception.' But,\" continued Jacob, \"tell me wherein he may deal cunningly with me.\" Rachel: \"I have an older sister, whom he desires to see married before me, and he will try to palm her off on thee instead of me.\" To be prepared for Laban's trickery, Jacob and Rachel agreed upon a sign by which he would recognize her in the nuptial night. Thus warned to be on his guard against Laban, Jacob worded his agreement with him regarding his marriage to Rachel with such precision that no room was left for distortion or guile. Jacob said: \"I know that the people of this place are knaves, therefore I desire to put the matter very clearly to thee. I will serve thee seven years for Rachel, hence not Leah; for thy daughter, that thou bringest me not some other woman likewise named Rachel; for the younger daughter, that thou exchangest not their names in the meantime.\" Nothing of all this availed: \"It profits not if a villain is cast into a sawmill\"—neither force nor gentle words can circumvent a rascal. Laban deceived not only Jacob, but also the guests whom he invited to the wedding.",

      "content": "After Jacob had served Laban seven years, he said to his uncle: \"The Lord destined me to be the father of twelve tribes. I am now eighty-four years old, and if I do not take thought of the matter now, when can I?\" Thereupon Laban consented to let him have his daughter Rachel to wife, and he was married forty-four years after his brother Esau. The Lord often defers the happiness of the pious, while He permits the wicked to enjoy the fulfilment of their desires soon. Esau, however, had purposely chosen his fortieth year for his marriage; he had wanted to indicate that he was walking in the footsteps of his father Isaac, who had likewise married at forty years of age. Esau was like a swine that stretches out its feet when it lies down, to show that it is cloven-footed like the clean animals, though it is none the less one of the unclean animals. Until his fortieth year Esau made a practice of violating the wives of other men, and then at his marriage he acted as though he were following the example of his pious father. Accordingly, the woman he married was of his own kind, Judith, a daughter of Heth, for God said: \"This one, who is designed for stubble, to be burnt by fire, shall take unto wife one of a people also destined for utter destruction.\" They, Esau and his wife, illustrated the saying, \"Not for naught does the raven consort with the crow; they are birds of a feather.\" Far different it was with Jacob. He married the two pious and lovely sisters, Leah and Rachel, for Leah, like her younger sister, was beautiful of countenance, form, and stature. She had but one defect, her eyes were weak, and this malady she had brought down upon herself, through her own action. Laban, who had two daughters, and Rebekah, his sister, who had two sons, had agreed by letter, while their children were still young, that the older son of the one was to marry the older daughter of the other, and the younger son the younger daughter. When Leah grew to maidenhood, and inquired about her future husband, all her tidings spoke of his villainous character, and she wept over her fate until her eyelashes dropped from their lids. But Rachel grew more and more beautiful day by day, for all who spoke of Jacob praised and extolled him, and \"good tidings make the bones fat.\" In view of the agreement between Laban and Rebekah, Jacob refused to marry the older daughter Leah. As it was, Esau was his mortal enemy, on account of what had happened regarding the birthright and the paternal blessing. If, now, Jacob married the maiden appointed for him, Esau would never forgive his younger brother. Therefore Jacob resolved to take to wife Rachel, the younger daughter of his uncle. Laban was of another mind. He purposed to marry of his older daughter first, for he knew that Jacob would consent to serve him a second period of seven years for love of Rachel. On the day of the wedding he assembled the inhabitants of Haran, and addressed them as follows: \"Ye know well that we used to suffer from lack of water, and as soon as this pious man Jacob came to dwell among us, we had water in abundance.\" \"What hast thou in mind to do?\" they asked Laban. He replied: \"If ye have naught to say against it, I will deceive him and give him Leah to wife. He loves Rachel with an exceeding great love, and for her sake he will tarry with us yet seven other years.\" \"Do as it pleaseth thee,\" his friends said. \"Well, then,\" said Laban, \"let each one of you give me a pledge that ye will not betray my purpose.\" With the pledges they left with him, Laban bought wine, oil, and meat for the wedding feast, and he set a meal before them which they had themselves paid for. Because he deceived his fellow-citizens thus, Laban is called Arami, \"the deceiver.\" They feasted all day long, until late at night, and when Jacob expressed his astonishment at the attention shown him, they said to him: \"Through thy piety thou didst a great service of lovingkindness unto us, our supply of water was increased unto abundance, and we desire to show our gratitude therefor.\" And, indeed, they tried to give him a hint of Laban's purpose. In the marriage ode which they sang they used the refrain \"Halia,\" in the hope that he would understand it as Ha Leah, \"This is Leah.\" But Jacob was unsuspicious and noticed nothing. When the bride was led into the nuptial chamber, the guests extinguished all the candles, much to Jacob's amazement. But their explanation satisfied him. \"Thinkest thou,\" they said, \"we have as little sense of decency as thy countrymen?\" Jacob therefore did not discover the deception practiced upon him until morning. During the night Leah responded whenever he called Rachel, for which he reproached her bitterly when daylight came. \"O thou deceiver, daughter of a deceiver, why didst thou answer me when I called Rachel's name?\" \"Is there a teacher without a pupil?\" asked Leah, in return. \"I but profited by thy instruction. When thy father called thee Esau, didst thou not say, Here am I?\" Jacob was greatly enraged against Laban, and he said to him: \"Why didst thou deal treacherously with me? Take back thy daughter, and let me depart, seeing thou didst act wickedly toward me.\" Laban pacified him, however, saying, \"It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the first-born,\" and Jacob agreed to serve yet seven other years for Rachel, and after the seven days of the feast of Leah's wedding were fulfilled, he married Rachel. With Leah and Rachel, Jacob received the handmaids Zilpah and Bilhah, two other daughters of Laban, whom his concubines had borne unto him.",

      "content": "The ways of God are not like unto the ways of men. A man clings close to his friend while he has riches, and forsakes him when he falls into poverty. But when God sees a mortal unsteady and faltering, He reaches a hand out to him, and raises him up. Thus it happened with Leah. She was hated by Jacob, and God visited her in mercy. Jacob's aversion to Leah began the very morning after their wedding, when his wife taunted him with not being wholly free from cunning and craft himself. Then God said, \"Help can come to Leah only if she gives birth to a child; then the love of her husband will return to her.\" God remembered the tears she had shed when she prayed that her doom, chaining her to that recreant Esau, be averted from her, and so wondrous are the uses of prayer that Leah, besides turning aside the impending decree, was permitted to marry Jacob before her sister and be the first to bear him a child. There was another reason why the Lord was compassionately inclined toward Leah. She had gotten herself talked about. The sailors on the sea, the travellers along the highways, the women at their looms, they all gossiped about Leah, saying, \"She is not within what her seeming is without. She appears to be pious, but if she were, she would not have deceived her sister.\" To put an end to all this tattle, God granted her the distinction of bearing a son at the end of seven months after her marriage. He was one of a pair of twins, the other child being a daughter. So it was with eleven of the sons of Jacob, all of them except Joseph were born twins with a girl, and the twin sister and brother married later on. Altogether it was an extraordinary childbirth, for Leah was barren, not formed by nature to bear children. She called her first-born son Reuben, which means \"See the normal man,\" for he was neither big nor little, neither dark nor fair, but exactly normal. In calling her oldest child Reuben, \"See the son,\" Leah indicated his future character. \"Behold the difference,\" the name implied, \"between my first-born son and the first-born son of my father in-law. Esau sold his birthright to Jacob of his own free will, and yet he hated him. As for my first-born son, although his birthright was taken from him without his consent, and given to Joseph, it was nevertheless he who rescued Joseph from the hands of his brethren.\" Leah called her second son Shime'on, \"Yonder is sin,\" for one of his descendants was that Zimri who was guilty of vile trespasses with the daughters of Moab. The name of her third son, Levi, was given him by God Himself, not by his mother. The Lord summoned him through the angel Gabriel, and bestowed the name upon him as one who is \"crowned\" with the twenty-four gifts that are the tribute due to the priests. At the birth of her fourth son, Leah returned thanks to God for a special reason. She knew that Jacob would beget twelve sons, and if they were distributed equally among his four wives, each would bear three. But now it appeared that she had one more than her due share, and she called him Jehudah, \"thanks unto God.\" She was thus the first since the creation of the world to give thanks to God, and her example was followed by David and Daniel, the descendants of her son Judah. When Rachel saw that her sister had borne Jacob four sons, she envied Leah. Not that she begrudged her the good fortune she enjoyed, she only envied her for her piety, saying to herself that it was to her righteous conduct that she owed the blessing of many children. Then she besought Jacob: \"Pray unto God for me, that He grant me children, else my life is no life. Verily, there are four that may be regarded as though they were dead, the blind, the leper, the childless, and he who was once rich and has lost his fortune.\" Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said: \"It were better thou shouldst address thy petition to God, and not to me, for am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?\" God was displeased with this answer that Jacob made to his sad wife. He rebuked him with the words: \"Is it thus thou wouldst comfort a grief-stricken heart? As thou livest, the day will come when thy children will stand before the son of Rachel, and he will use the same words thou hast but now used, saying, 'Am I in the place of the Lord?'\" Rachel also made reply to Jacob, saying: \"Did not thy father, too, entreat God for thy mother with earnest words, beseeching Him to remove her barrenness?\" Jacob: \"It is true, but Isaac had no children, and I have several.\" Rachel: \"Remember thy grandfather Abraham, thou canst not deny that he had children when he supplicated God in behalf of Sarah!\" Jacob: \"Wouldst thou do for me what Sarah did for my grandfather?\" Rachel: \"Pray, what did she?\" Jacob: \"She herself brought a rival into her house.\" Rachel: \"If that is all that is necessary, I am ready to follow the example of Sarah, and I pray that as she was granted a child for having invited a rival, so may I be blessed, too.\" Thereupon Rachel gave Jacob Bilhah, her freed handmaid, to wife, and she bore him a son, whom Rachel called Dan, saying, \"As the Lord was gracious unto me and gave me a son according to my petition, so He will permit Samson, the descendant of Dan, to judge his people, that it fall not into the hands of the Philistines.\" Bilhah's second son Rachel named Naphtali, saying, \"Mine is the bond that binds Jacob to this place, for it was for my sake that he came to Laban.\" At the same time she wanted to convey by this name that the Torah, which is as sweet as Nofet, \"honeycomb,\" would be taught in the territory of Naphtali. And the name had still a third meaning: \"As God hath heard my fervent prayer for a son, so He will hearken unto the fervent prayer of the Naphtalites when they are beset by their enemies.\" Leah, seeing that she had left bearing, while Bilhah, her sister's handmaid, bore Jacob two sons, concluded that it was Jacob's destiny to have four wives, her sister and herself, and their half-sisters Bilhah and Zilpah. Therefore she also gave him her handmaid to wife. Zilpah was the youngest of the four women. It was the custom of that time to give the older daughter the older handmaid, and the younger daughter the younger handmaid, as their dowry, when they got married. Now, in order to make Jacob believe that his wife was the younger daughter he had served for, Laban had given Leah the younger handmaid as her marriage portion. This Zilpah was so young that her body betrayed no outward signs of pregnancy, and nothing was known of her condition until her son was born. Leah called the boy Gad, which means \"fortune,\" or it may mean \"the cutter,\" for from Gad was descended the prophet Elijah, who brings good fortune to Israel, and he also cuts down the heathen world. Leah had other reasons, too, for choosing this name of double meaning. The tribe of Gad had the good fortune of entering into possession of its allotment in the Holy Land before any of the others, and, also, Gad the son of Jacob was born circumcised. To Zilpah's second son Leah gave the name of Asher, \"praise,\" for, she said, \"Unto me all manner of praise is due, for I brought my handmaid into the house of my husband as wife. Sarah did likewise, but only because she had no children, and so it was also with Rachel. But as for me, I had children, and nevertheless I subdued my passion, and without jealousy I gave my handmaid to my husband for wife. Verily, all will praise and extol me.\" Furthermore she spoke: \"As the women will praise me, so the sons of Asher will in time to come praise God for their fruitful possession in the Holy Land.\" The next son born unto Jacob was Issachar, \"a reward,\" and once more it was Leah who was permitted to bring forth the child, as a reward from God for her pious desire to have the twelve tribes come into the world. To secure this result, she left no means untried. It happened once that her oldest son Reuben was tending his father's ass during the harvest, and he bound him to a root of dudaim, and went his way. On returning, he found the dudaim torn out of the ground, and the ass lying dead beside it. The beast had uprooted it in trying to get loose, and the plant has a peculiar quality, whoever tears it up must die. As it was the time of the harvest, when it is permitted for any one to take a plant from a field, and as dudaim is, besides, a plant which the owner of a field esteems lightly, Reuben carried it home. Being a good son, he did not keep it for himself, but gave it to his mother. Rachel desired the dudaim, and she asked the plant of Leah, who parted with it to her sister, but on the condition that Jacob, when he returned from work in the evening, should tarry with her for a while. It was altogether unbecoming conduct in Rachel to dispose thus of her husband. She gained the dudaim, but she lost two tribes. If she had acted otherwise, she would have borne four sons instead of two. And she suffered another punishment, her body was not permitted to rest in the grave beside her husband's. Jacob came home from the field after night had fallen, for he observed the law obliging a day laborer to work until darkness sets in, and Jacob's zeal in the affairs of Laban was as great in the last seven years, after his marriage, as in the first seven, while he was serving for the hand of Rachel. When Leah heard the braying of Jacob's ass, she ran to meet her husband, and without giving him time to wash his feet, she insisted upon his turning aside into her tent. At first Jacob refused to go, but God compelled him to enter, for unto God it was known that Leah acted from pure, disinterested motives. Her dudaim secured two sons for her, Issachar, the father of the tribe that devotes itself to the study of the Torah, whence his name meaning \"reward,\" and Zebulon, whose descendants carried on commerce, using their profits to enable their brethren of Issachar to keep at their studies. Leah called this last-born son of hers Zebulon, \"dwelling-place,\" for she said, \"Now will my husband dwell with me, seeing that I have borne him six sons, and, also, the sons of Zebulon will have a goodly dwelling-place in the Holy Land.\" Leah bore once more, and this last time it was a daughter, a man child turned into a woman by her prayer. When she conceived for the seventh time, she spake as follows: \"God promised Jacob twelve sons. I bore him six, and each of the two handmaids has borne him two. If, now, I were to bring forth another son, my sister Rachel would not be equal even unto the handmaids.\" Therefore she prayed to God to change the male embryo in her womb into a female, and God hearkened unto her prayer. Now all the wives of Jacob, Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah, united their prayers with the prayer of Jacob, and together they besought God to remove the curse of barrenness from Rachel. On New Year's Day, the day whereon God sits in judgment upon the inhabitants of the earth, He remembered Rachel, and granted her a son. And Rachel spake, \"God hath taken away my reproach,\" for all the people had said that she was not a pious woman, else had she borne children, and now that God had hearkened to her, and opened her womb, such idle talk no longer had any reason. By bearing a son, she had escaped another disgrace. She had said to herself: \"Jacob hath a mind to return to the land of his birth, and my father will not be able to hinder his daughters who have borne him children from following their husband thither with their children. But he will not let me, the childless wife, go, too, and he will keep me here and marry me to one of the uncircumcised.\" She said furthermore, \"As my son hath removed my reproach, so Joshua, his descendant, will roll away a reproach from the Israelites, when he circumcises them beyond Jordan.\" Rachel called her son Joseph, \"increase,\" saying, \"God will give me an additional son.\" Prophetess as she was, she foresaw she would have a second son. But an increase added on by God is larger than the original capital itself. Benjamin, the second son, whom Rachel regarded merely as a supplement, had ten sons, while Joseph begot only two. These twelve together may be considered the twelve tribes borne by Rachel. Had Rachel not used the form of expression, \"The Lord add to me another son,\" she herself would have begotten twelve tribes with Jacob.",

      "content": "Jacob had only been waiting for Joseph to be born to begin preparations for his journey home. The holy spirit had revealed to him that the house of Joseph would work the destruction of the house of Esau, and, therefore, Jacob exclaimed at the birth of Joseph, \"Now I need not fear Esau or his legions.\" About this time, Rebekah sent her nurse Deborah, the daughter of Uz, accompanied by two of Isaac's servants, to Jacob, to urge him to return to his father's house, now that his fourteen years of service had come to an end. Then Jacob approached Laban, and spoke, \"Give me my wives and my children, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country, for my mother has sent messengers unto me, bidding me to return to my father's house.\" Laban answered, saying, \"O that I might find favor in thine eyes! By a sign it was made known unto me that God blesseth me for thy sake.\" What Laban had in mind was the treasure he had found on the day Jacob came to him, and he considered that a token of his beneficent powers. Indeed, God had wrought many a thing in the house of Laban that testified to the blessings spread abroad by the pious. Shortly before Jacob came, a pest had broken out among Laban's cattle, and with his arrival it ceased. And Laban had had no son, but during Jacob's sojourn in Haran sons were born unto him. All the hire he asked in return for his labor and for the blessings he had brought Laban was the speckled and spotted among the goats of his herd, and the black among the sheep. Laban assented to his conditions, saying, \"Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.\" The arch-villain Laban, whose tongue wagged in all directions, and who made all sorts of promises that were never kept, judged others by himself, and therefore suspected Jacob of wanting to deceive him. And yet, in the end, it was Laban himself who broke his word. No less than a hundred times he changed the agreement between them. Nevertheless his unrighteous conduct was of no avail. Though a three days' journey had been set betwixt Laban's flocks and Jacob's, the angels were wont to bring the sheep belonging to Laban down to Jacob's sheep, and Jacob's droves grew constantly larger and better. Laban had given only the feeble and sick to Jacob, yet the young of the flock, raised under Jacob's tendance, were so excellent in quality that people bought them at a heavy price. And Jacob had no need to resort to the peeled rods. He had but to speak, and the flocks bare according to his desire. What Laban deserved was utter ruin, for having permitted the pious Jacob to work for him without hire, and after his wages had been changed ten times, and ten times Laban had tried to overreach him, God rewarded him in this way. But his good luck with the flocks was only what Jacob deserved. Every faithful laborer is rewarded by God in this world, quite regardless of what awaits him in the world to come. With empty hands Jacob had come to Laban, and he left him with herds numbering six hundred thousand. Their increase had been marvellous, an increase that will be equalled only in the Messianic time. The wealth and good fortune of Jacob called forth the envy of Laban and his sons, and they could not hide their vexation in their intercourse with him. And the Lord said unto Jacob, \"Thy father-in-law's countenance is not toward thee as beforetime, and yet thou tarriest with him? Do thou rather return unto the land of thy fathers, and there I will let My Shekinah rest upon thee, for I cannot permit the Shekinah to reside outside of the Holy Land.\" Immediately Jacob sent the fleet messenger Naphtali to Rachel and Leah to summon them to a consultation, and he chose as the place of meeting the open field, where none could overhear what was said. His two wives approved the plan of returning to his home, and Jacob resolved at once to go away with all his substance, without as much as acquainting Laban with his intention. Laban was gone to shear his sheep, and so Jacob could execute his plan without delay. That her father might not learn about their flight from his teraphim, Rachel stole them, and she took them and concealed them upon the camel upon which she sat, and she went on. And this is the manner they used to make the images: They took a man who was the first-born, slew him and took the hair off his head, then salted the head, and anointed it with oil, then they wrote \"the Name\" upon a small tablet of copper or gold, and placed it under his tongue. The head with the tablet under the tongue was then put in a house where lights were lighted before it, and at the time when they bowed down to it, it spoke to them on all matters that they asked of it, and that was due to the power of the Name which was written upon it.",

      "content": "Jacob departed and crossed the Euphrates, and set his face toward Gilead, for the holy spirit revealed to him that God would bring help there to his children in the days of Jephthah. Meantime the shepherds of Haran observed that the well, which had been filled to overflowing since the arrival of Jacob in their place, ran dry suddenly. For three days they watched and waited, in the hope that the waters would return in the same abundance as before. Disappointed, they finally told Laban of the misfortune, and he divined at once that Jacob had departed thence, for he knew that the blessing had been conferred upon Haran only for the sake of his son-in-law's merits. On the morrow Laban rose early, assembled all the people of the city, and pursued Jacob with the intention of killing him when he overtook him. But the archangel Michael appeared unto him, and bade him take heed unto himself, that he do not the least unto Jacob, else would he suffer death himself. This message from heaven came to Laban during the night, for when, in extraordinary cases, God finds it necessary to reveal Himself unto the heathen, He does it only in the dark, clandestinely as it were, while He shows Himself to the prophets of the Jews openly, during daylight. Laban accomplished the journey in one day for which Jacob had taken seven, and he overtook him at the mountain of Gilead. When he came upon Jacob, he found him in the act of praying and giving praise unto God. Immediately Laban fell to remonstrating with his son-in-law for having stolen away unawares to him. He showed his true character when he said, \"It is in the power of my hand to do thee hurt, but the God of thy father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\" That is the way of the wicked, they boast of the evil they can do. Laban wanted to let Jacob know that only the dream warning him against doing aught that was harmful to Jacob prevented him from carrying out the wicked design he had formed against him. Laban continued to take Jacob to task, and he concluded with the words, \"And now, though thou wouldst needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?\" When he pronounced the last words, his grandchildren interrupted him, saying, \"We are ashamed of thee, grandfather, that in thy old age thou shouldst use such words as 'my gods.'\" Laban searched all the tents for his idols, going first to the tent of Jacob, which was Rachel's at the same time, for Jacob always dwelt with his favorite wife. Finding nothing, he went thence to Leah's tent, and to the tents of the two handmaids, and, noticing that Rachel was feeling about here and there, his suspicions were aroused, and he entered her tent a second time. He would now have found what he was looking for, if a miracle had not come to pass. The teraphim were transformed into drinking vessels, and Laban had to desist from his fruitless search. Now Jacob, who did not know that Rachel had stolen her father's teraphim in order to turn him aside from his idolatrous ways, was wroth with Laban, and began to chide with him. In the quarrel between them, Jacob's noble character manifested itself. Notwithstanding his excitement, he did not suffer a single unbecoming word to escape him. He only reminded Laban of the loyalty and devotion with which he had served him, doing for him what none other would or could have done. He said: \"I dealt wrongfully with the lion, for God had appointed of Laban's sheep for the lion's daily sustenance, and I deprived him thereof. Could another shepherd have done thus? Yes, the people abused me, calling me robber and sneak thief, for they thought that only by stealing by day and stealing by night could I replace the animals torn by wild beasts. And as to my honesty,\" he continued, \"is it likely there is another son-in-law who, having lived with his father-in-law, hath not taken some little thing from the household of his father-in-law, a knife, or other trifle? But thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Not so much as a needle or a nail.\" In his indignation, and conscious of his innocence, Jacob exclaimed, \"With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live,\" words which contained a curse—the thief was cursed with premature death, and therefore Rachel had to die in giving birth to Benjamin. Indeed, the curse would have taken effect at once, had it not been the wish of God that Rachel should bear Jacob his youngest son. After the quarrel, the two men made a treaty, and with his gigantic strength Jacob set up a huge rock as a memorial, and a heap of stones as a sign of their covenant. In this matter Jacob followed the example of his fathers, who likewise had covenanted with heathen nations, Abraham with the Jebusites, and Isaac with the Philistines. Therefore Jacob did not hesitate to make a treaty with the Arameans. Jacob summoned his sons, calling them brethren, for they were his peers in piety and strength, and he bade them cast up heaps of stones. Thereupon he swore unto his father-in-law that he would take no wives beside his four daughters, either while they were alive or after their death, and Laban, on his part, swore that he would not pass over the heaps or over the pillar unto Jacob with hostile intent, and he took the oath by the God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, while Jacob made mention of the Fear of Isaac. He refrained from using the term \"the God of Isaac,\" because God never unites His name with that of a living person, for the reason that so long as a man has not ended his years, no trust may be put in him, lest he be seduced by the evil inclination. It is true, when He appeared unto Jacob at Beth-el, God called Himself \"the God of Isaac.\" There was a reason for the unusual phrase. Being blind, Isaac led a retired life, within his tent, and the evil inclination had no power over him any more. But though God had full confidence in Isaac, yet Jacob could not venture to couple the name of God with the name of a living man, wherefore he took his oath by \"the Fear of Isaac.\" Early in the morning after the day of covenanting, Laban rose up, and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters, and blessed them. But these acts and words of his did not come from the heart; in his innermost thoughts he regretted that Jacob and his family and his substance had escaped him. His true feelings he betrayed in the message which he sent to Esau at once upon his return to Haran, by the hand of his son Beor and ten companions of his son. The message read: \"Hast thou heard what Jacob thy brother has done unto me, who first came to me naked and bare, and I went to meet him, and took him to my house with honor, and brought him up, and gave him my two daughters for wives, and also two of my maids? And God blessed him on my account, and he increased abundantly, and had sons and daughters and maid-servants, and also an uncommon stock of flocks and herds, camels and asses, also silver and gold in abundance. But when he saw that his wealth increased, he left me while I went to shear my sheep, and he rose up and fled in secrecy. And he put his wives and children upon camels, and he led away all his cattle and substance which he acquired in my land, and he resolved to go to his father Isaac, to the land of Canaan. And he did not suffer me to kiss my sons and daughters, and he carried away my daughters as captives of the sword, and he also stole my gods, and he fled. And now I have left him in the mountain of the brook of Jabbok, he and all belonging to him, not a jot of his substance is lacking. If it be thy wish to go to him, go, and there wilt thou find him, and thou canst do unto him as thy soul desireth.\" Jacob had no need to fear either Laban or Esau, for on his journey he was accompanied by two angel hosts, one going with him from Haran to the borders of the Holy Land, where he was received by the other host, the angels of Palestine. Each of these hosts consisted of no less than six hundred thousand angels, and when he beheld them, Jacob said: \"Ye belong neither to the host of Esau, who is preparing to go out to war against me, nor the host of Laban, who is about to pursue me again. Ye are the hosts of the holy angels sent by the Lord.\" And he gave the name Mahanaim, Double-Host, to the spot on which the second army relieved the first.",

      "content": "The message of Laban awakened Esau's old hatred toward Jacob with increased fury, and he assembled his household, consisting of sixty men. With them and three hundred and forty inhabitants of Seir, he went forth to do battle with Jacob and kill him. He divided his warriors into seven cohorts, giving to his son Eliphaz his own division of sixty, and putting the other six divisions under as many of the Horites. While Esau was hastening onward to meet Jacob, the messengers which Laban had sent to Esau came to Rebekah and told her that Esau and his four hundred men were about to make war upon Jacob, with the purpose of slaying him and taking possession of all he had. Anxious lest Esau should execute his plan while yet Jacob was on the journey, she hastily dispatched seventy-two of the retainers of Isaac's household, to give him help. Jacob, tarrying on the banks of the brook Jabbok, rejoiced at the sight of these men, and he greeted them with the words, \"This is God's helping host,\" wherefore he called the place of their meeting Mahanaim, Host. After the warriors sent by Rebekah had satisfied his questions regarding the welfare of his parents, they delivered his mother's message unto him, thus: \"I have heard, my son, that thy brother Esau hath gone forth against thee on the road, with men of the children of Seir the Horite, and therefore, my son, hearken to my voice, and take counsel with thyself what thou wilt do, and when he cometh up to thee, supplicate him, and do not speak roughly to him, and give him a present from what thou possessest, and from what God has favored thee with. And when he asketh thee concerning thy affairs, conceal nothing from him, perhaps he may turn from his anger against thee, and thou wilt thereby save thy soul, thou and all belonging to thee, for it is thy duty to honor him, since he is thy elder brother.\" And when Jacob heard the words of his mother which the messengers had spoken to him, he lifted up his voice and wept bitterly, and did as his mother commanded him. He sent messengers to Esau to placate him, and they said unto him: \"Thus speaketh thy servant Jacob: My lord, think not that the blessing which my father bestowed upon me profited me. Twenty years I served Laban, and he deceived me, and changed my hire ten times, as thou well knowest. Yet did I labor sorely in his house, and God saw my affliction, my labor, and the work of my hands, and afterward He caused me to find grace and favor in the sight of Laban. And through God's great mercy and kindness, I acquired oxen and asses and cattle and men-servants and maid servants. And now I am coming to my country and to my home, to my father and mother, who are in the land of Canaan. And I have sent to let my lord know all this in order to find favor in the eyes of my lord, so that he may not imagine that I have become a man of substance, or that the blessing with which my father blessed me has benefited me.\" Furthermore spake the messengers: \"Why dost thou envy me in respect to the blessing wherewith my father blessed me? Is it that the sun shineth in my land, and not in thine? Or doth the dew and the rain fall only upon my land, and not upon thine? If my father blessed me with the dew of heaven, he blessed thee with the fatness of the earth, and if he spoke to me, Peoples will serve thee, he hath said unto thee, By thy sword shalt thou live. How long, then, wilt thou continue to envy me? Come, now, let us set up a covenant between us, that we will share equally all the vexations that may occur.\" Esau would not agree to this proposal, his friends dissuaded him therefrom, saying, \"Accept not these conditions, for God hath said to Abraham, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve the people thereof, and the aliens shall afflict them four hundred years. Wait, therefore, until Jacob and his family go down into Egypt to pay off this debt.\" Jacob also sent word to Esau, saying: \"Though I dwelt with that heathen of the heathen, Laban, yet have I not forgotten my God, but I fulfil the six hundred and thirteen commandments of the Torah. If thy mind be set upon peace, thou wilt find me ready for peace. But if thy desire be war, thou wilt find me ready for war. I have with me men of valor and strength, they have but to utter a word, and God fulfils it. I tarried with Laban until Joseph should be born, he who is destined to subdue thee. And though my descendants be held in bondage in this world, yet a day will come when they will rule over their rulers.\" In reply to all these gentle words, Esau spoke with arrogance: \"Surely I have heard, and truly it has been told unto me what Jacob has been to Laban, who brought him up in his house, and gave him his daughters for wives, and he begot sons and daughters, and abundantly increased in wealth and riches in Laban's house and with his help. And when he saw that his wealth was abundant and his riches were great, he fled with all belonging to him from Laban's house, and he carried away Laban's daughters from their father as captives of the sword, without telling him of it. And not only to Laban hath Jacob done thus, but also unto me hath he done so, and he hath twice supplanted me, and shall I be silent? Now, I have this day come with my camp to meet him, and I will do unto him according to the desire of my heart.\" The messengers dispatched by Jacob now returned to him, and reported these words of Esau unto him. They also told him that his brother was advancing against him with an army consisting of four hundred crowned heads, each leading a host of four hundred men. \"It is true, thou art his brother, and thou treatest him as a brother should,\" they said to Jacob, \"but he is an Esau, thou must be made aware of his villainy.\" Jacob bore in mind the promise of God, that He would bring him back to his father's house in peace, yet the report about his brother's purpose alarmed him greatly. A pious man may never depend upon promises of earthly good. God does not keep the promise if he is guilty of the smallest conceivable trespass, and Jacob feared that he might have forfeited happiness by reason of a sin committed by him. Moreover, he was anxious lest Esau be the one favored by God, inasmuch as he had these twenty years been fulfilling two Divine commands that Jacob had had to disregard. Esau had been living in the Holy Land, Jacob outside of it; the former had been in attendance upon his parents, the latter dwelling at a distance from them. And much as he feared defeat, Jacob also feared the reverse, that he might be victorious over Esau, or might even slay his brother, which would be as bad as to be slain by him. And he was depressed by another apprehension, that his father had died, for he reasoned that Esau would not take such warlike steps against his own brother, were his father still alive. When his wives saw the anxiety that possessed Jacob, they began to quarrel with him, and reproach him for having taken them away from their father's house, though he knew that such danger threatened from Esau. Then Jacob determined to apply the three means that might save him from the fate impending: he would cry to God for help, appease Esau's wrath with presents, and hold himself in readiness for war if the worst came to the worst. He prayed to God: \"O Thou God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, God of all who walk in the ways of the pious and do like unto them! I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which Thou hast showed unto Thy servant. O Lord of the world, as Thou didst not suffer Laban to execute his evil designs against me, so also bring to naught the purpose of Esau, who desireth to slay me. O Lord of the world, in Thy Torah which Thou wilt give us on Mount Sinai it is written, And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day. If this wretch should come and murder my children and their mothers at the same time, who would then desire to read Thy Torah which Thou wilt give us on Mount Sinai? And yet Thou didst speak, For the sake of thy merits and for the merits of thy fathers I will do good unto thee, and in the future world thy children shall be as numerous as the sand of the sea.\" As Jacob prayed for his own deliverance, so also he prayed for the salvation of his descendants, that they might not be annihilated by the descendants of Esau. Such was the prayer of Jacob when he saw Esau approaching from afar, and God heard his petition and looked upon his tears, and He gave him the assurance that for his sake his descendants, too, would be redeemed from all distress. Then the Lord sent three angels, and they went before Esau, and they appeared unto Esau and his people as hundreds and thousands of men riding upon horses. They were furnished with all sorts of weapons, and divided into four columns. And one division went on, and they found Esau coming with four hundred men, and the division ran toward them, and terrified them. Esau fell off his horse in alarm, and all his men separated from him in great fear, while the approaching column shouted after them, \"Verily, we are the servants of Jacob, the servant of God, and who can stand against us?\" Esau then said unto them, \"O, then my lord and brother Jacob is your lord, whom I have not seen these twenty years, and now that I have this day come to see him, do you treat me in this manner?\" The angels answered, \"As the Lord liveth, were not Jacob thy brother, we had not left one remaining of thee and thy people, but on account of Jacob we will do nothing to thee.\" This division passed from Esau, and when he had gone from there about a league, the second division came toward him, and they also did unto Esau and his men as the first had done to them, and when they permitted him to go on, the third came and did like the first, and when the third had passed also, and Esau still continued with his men on the road to Jacob, the fourth division came and did to them as the others had done. And Esau was greatly afraid of his brother, because he thought that the four columns of the army which he had encountered were the servants of Jacob. After Jacob had made an end of praying, he divided all that journeyed with him into two companies, and he set over them Damesek and Alinus, the two sons of Eliezer, the bondman of Abraham, and their sons. Jacob's example teaches us not to conceal the whole of our fortune in one hiding-place, else we run the danger of losing everything at one stroke. Of his cattle he sent a part to Esau as a present, first dividing it into three droves in order to impress his brother more. When Esau received the first drove, he would think he had the whole gift that had been sent to him, and suddenly he would be astonished by the appearance of the second portion, and again by the third. Jacob knew his brother's avarice only too well. The men who were the bearers of Jacob's present to Esau were charged with the following message, \"This is an offering to my lord Esau from his slave Jacob.\" But God took these words of Jacob in ill part, saying, \"Thou profanest what is holy when thou callest Esau lord.\" Jacob excused himself; he was but flattering the wicked in order to escape death at his hands.",

      "content": "The servants of Jacob went before him with the present for Esau, and he followed with his wives and his children. As he was about to pass over the ford of Jabbok, he observed a shepherd, who likewise had sheep and camels. The stranger approached Jacob and proposed that they should ford the stream together, and help each other move their cattle over, and Jacob assented, on the condition that his possessions should be put across first. In the twinkling of an eye Jacob's sheep were transferred to the other side of the stream by the shepherd. Then the flocks of the shepherd were to be moved by Jacob, but no matter how many he took over to the opposite bank, always there remained some on the hither shore. There was no end to the cattle, though Jacob labored all the night through. At last he lost patience, and he fell upon the shepherd and caught him by the throat, crying out, \"O thou wizard, thou wizard, at night no enchantment succeeds!\" The angel thought, \"Very well, let him know once for all with whom he has had dealings,\" and with his finger he touched the earth, whence fire burst forth. But Jacob said, \"What! thou thinkest thus to affright me, who am made wholly of fire?\" The shepherd was no less a personage than the archangel Michael, and in his combat with Jacob he was assisted by the whole host of angels under his command. He was on the point of inflicting a dangerous wound upon Jacob, when God appeared, and all the angels, even Michael himself, felt their strength ooze away. Seeing that he could not prevail against Jacob, the archangel touched the hollow of his thigh, and injured him, and God rebuked him, saying, \"Dost thou act as is seemly, when thou causest a blemish in My priest Jacob?\" Michael said in astonishment, \"Why, it is I who am Thy priest!\" But God said, \"Thou art My priest in heaven, and he is My priest on earth.\" Thereupon Michael summoned the archangel Raphael, saying, \"My comrade, I pray thee, help me out of my distress, for thou art charged with the healing of all disease,\" and Raphael cured Jacob of the injury Michael had inflicted. The Lord continued to reproach Michael, saying, \"Why didst thou do harm unto My first-born son?\" and the archangel answered, \"I did it only to glorify Thee,\" and then God appointed Michael as the guardian angel of Jacob and his seed unto the end of all generations, with these words: \"Thou art a fire, and so is Jacob a fire; thou art the head of the angels, and he is the head of the nations; thou art supreme over all the angels, and he is supreme over all the peoples. Therefore he who is supreme over all the angels shall be appointed unto him who is supreme over all the peoples, that he may entreat mercy for him from the Supreme One over all.\" Then Michael said unto Jacob, \"How is it possible that thou who couldst prevail against me, the most distinguished of the angels, art afraid of Esau?\" When the day broke, Michael said to Jacob, \"Let me go, for the day breaketh,\" but Jacob held him back, saying, \"Art thou a thief, or a gambler with dice, that thou fearest the daylight?\" At that moment appeared many different hosts of angels, and they called unto Michael: \"Ascend, O Michael, the time of song hath come, and if thou art not in heaven to lead the choir, none will sing.\" And Michael entreated Jacob with supplications to let him go, for he feared the angels of 'Arabot would consume him with fire, if he were not there to start the songs of praise at the proper time. Jacob said, \"I will not let thee go, except thou bless me,\" whereto Michael made reply: \"Who is greater, the servant or the son? I am the servant, and thou art the son. Why, then, cravest thou my blessing?\" Jacob urged as an argument, \"The angels that visited Abraham did not leave without blessing him,\" but Michael held, \"They were sent by God for that very purpose, and I was not.\" Yet Jacob insisted upon his demand, and Michael pleaded with him, saying, \"The angels that betrayed a heavenly secret were banished from their place for one hundred and thirty eight years. Dost thou desire that I should acquaint thee with what would cause my banishment likewise?\" In the end the angel nevertheless had to yield; Jacob could not be moved, and Michael took counsel with himself thus: \"I will reveal a secret to him, and if God demands to know why I revealed it, I will make answer, Thy children stand upon their wishes with Thee, and Thou dost yield to them. How, then, could I have left Jacob's wish unfulfilled?\" Then Michael spoke to Jacob, saying: \"A day will come when God will reveal Himself unto thee, and He will change thy name, and I shall be present when He changeth it. Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel, for happy thou, of woman born, who didst enter the heavenly palace, and didst escape thence with thy life.\" And Michael blessed Jacob with the words, \"May it be the will of God that thy descendants be as pious as thou art.\" At the same time the archangel reminded Jacob that he had promised to give a tithe of his possessions unto God, and at once Jacob separated five hundred and fifty head of cattle from his herds, which counted fifty-five hundred. Then Michael went on, \"But thou hast sons, and of them thou hast not set apart the tenth.\" Jacob proceeded to pass his sons in review: Reuben, Joseph, Dan, and Gad being the first-born, each of his mother, were exempt, and there remained but eight sons, and when he had named them, down to Benjamin, he had to go back and begin over again with Simon, the ninth, and finish with Levi as the tenth. Michael took Levi with him into heaven, and presented him before God, saying, \"O Lord of the world, this one is Thy lot, and the tenth belonging unto Thee,\" and God stretched forth His hand and blessed Levi with the blessing that his children should be the servants of God on earth as the angels were His servants on high. Michael spoke again, \"Doth not a king provide for the sustenance of his servants?\" whereupon God appointed for the Levites all that was holy unto the Lord. Then Jacob spoke to the angel: \"My father conferred the blessing upon me that was intended for Esau, and now I desire to know whether thou wilt acknowledge the blessing as mine, or wilt bring charges against me on account of it.\" And the angel said: \"I acknowledge the blessing to be thine by right. Thou didst not gain it by craft and cunning, and I and all the heavenly powers recognize it to be valid, for thou hast shown thyself master over the mighty powers of the heavens as over Esau and his legions.\" And even then Jacob would not let the angel depart, he had to reveal his name to him first, and the angel made known to him that it was Israel, the same name that Jacob would once bear. At last the angel departed, after Jacob had blessed him, and Jacob called the place of wrestling Penuel, the same place to which before he had given the name Mahanaim, for both words have but one meaning, the place of encounter with angels.",

      "title": "The Meeting Between Esau And Jacob",
      "content": "At the break of day the angel left off from wrestling with Jacob. The dawn on that day was of particularly short duration. The sun rose two hours before his time, by way of compensation for having set early, on the day on which Jacob passed Mount Moriah on his journey to Haran, to induce him to turn aside and lodge for a night on the future Temple place. Indeed, the power of the sun on this same day was altogether remarkable. He shone with the brilliance and ardor with which he was invested during the six days of the creation, and as he will shine at the end of days, to make whole the halt and the blind among the Jews and to consume the heathen. This same healing and devastating property he had on that day, too, for Jacob was cured, while Esau and his princes were all but burnt up by his terrible heat. Jacob was in dire need of healing lotions for the injury he had sustained in the encounter with the angel. The combat between them had been grim, the dust whirled up by the scuffle rose to the very throne of God. Though Jacob prevailed against his huge opponent, as big as one-third of the whole world, throwing him to the ground and keeping him pinned down, yet the angel had injured him by clutching at the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, so that it was dislocated, and Jacob halted upon his thigh. The healing power of the sun restored him, nevertheless his children took it upon themselves not to eat the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, for they reproached themselves with having been the cause of his mishap, they should not have left him alone in that night. Now, although Jacob had prepared for the worst, for open hostilities even, yet when he saw Esau and his men, he thought it discreet to make separate divisions of the households of Leah, Rachel, and the handmaids, and divide the children unto each of them. And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. It was the stratagem which the fox used with the lion. Once upon a time the king of beasts was wroth with his subjects, and they looked hither and thither for a spokesman who mastered the art of appeasing their ruler. The fox offered himself for the undertaking, saying, \"I know three hundred fables which will allay his fury.\" His offer was accepted with joy. On the way to the lion, the fox suddenly stood still, and in reply to the questions put to him, he said, \"I have forgotten one hundred of the three hundred fables.\" \"Never mind,\" said those accompanying him, \"two hundred will serve the purpose.\" A little way further on the fox again stopped suddenly, and, questioned again, he confessed that he had forgotten half of the two hundred remaining fables. The animals with him still consoled him that the hundred he knew would suffice. But the fox halted a third time, and then he admitted that his memory had failed him entirely, and he had forgotten all the fables he knew, and he advised that every animal approach the king on his own account and endeavor to appease his anger. At first Jacob had had courage enough to enter the lists with Esau in behalf of all with him. Now he came to the conclusion to let each one try to do what he could for himself. However, Jacob was too fond a father to expose his family to the first brunt of the danger. He himself passed over before all the rest, saying, \"It is better that they attack me than my children.\" After him came the handmaids and their children. His reason for placing them there was that, if Esau should be overcome by passion for the women, and try to violate them, he would thus meet the handmaids first, and in the meantime Jacob would have the chance of preparing for more determined resistance in the defense of the honor of his wives. Joseph and Rachel came last, and Joseph walked in front of his mother, though Jacob had ordered the reverse. But the son knew both the beauty of his mother and the lustfulness of his uncle, and therefore he tried to hide Rachel from the sight of Esau. In the vehemence of his rage against Jacob, Esau vowed that he would not slay him with bow and arrow, but would bite him dead with his mouth, and suck his blood. But he was doomed to bitter disappointment, for Jacob's neck turned as hard as ivory, and in his helpless fury Esau could but gnash his teeth. The two brothers were like the ram and the wolf. A wolf wanted to tear a ram in pieces, and the ram defended himself with his horns, striking them deep into the flesh of the wolf. Both began to howl, the wolf because he could not secure his prey, and the ram from fear that the wolf renew his attacks. Esau bawled because his teeth were hurt by the ivory-like flesh of Jacob's neck, and Jacob feared that his brother would make a second attempt to bite him. Esau addressed a question to his brother. \"Tell me,\" he said, \"what was the army I met?\" for on his march against Jacob he had had a most peculiar experience with a great host of forty thousand warriors. It consisted of various kinds of troops, armor-clad soldiers walking on foot, mounted on horses, and seated in chariots, and they all threw themselves upon Esau when they met. He demanded to know whence they came, and the strange soldiers hardly interrupted their savage onslaught to reply that they belonged to Jacob. Only when Esau told them that Jacob was his brother did they leave off, saying, \"Woe to us if our master hears that we did thee harm.\" This was the army and the encounter Esau inquired about as soon as he met his brother. But the army was a host of angels, who had the appearance of warriors to Esau and his men. Also the messengers sent by Jacob to Esau had been angels, for no mere human being could be induced to go forth and face the recreant. Jacob now gave Esau the presents intended for him, a tenth of all his cattle, and also pearls and precious stones, and, besides, a falcon for the chase. But even the animals refused to give up their gentle master Jacob and become the property of the villain Esau. They all ran away when Jacob wanted to hand them over to his brother, and the result was that the only ones that reached Esau were the feeble and the lame, all that could not make good their escape. At first Esau declined the presents offered to him. Naturally, that was a mere pretense. While refusing the gifts with words, he held his hand outstretched ready to receive them. Jacob took the hint, and insisted that he accept them, saying: \"Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand, forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as I have seen the face of angels, and thou art pleased with me.\" The closing words were chosen with well-calculated purpose. Jacob wanted Esau to derive the meaning that he had intercourse with angels, and to be inspired with awe. Jacob was like the man invited to a banquet by his mortal enemy who has been seeking an opportunity to slay him. When the guest divines the purpose for which he has been brought thither, he says to the host: \"What a magnificent and delicious meal this is! But once before in my life did I partake of one like it, and that was when I was bidden by the king to his table\"—enough to drive terror to the heart of the would-be slayer. He takes good care not to harm a man on such intimate terms with the king as to be invited to his table! Jacob had valid reason for recalling his encounter with the angel, for it was the angel of Esau who had measured his strength with Jacob's, and had been overcome. As Esau accepted the presents of Jacob willingly on this first occasion, so he continued to accept them for a whole year; daily Jacob gave him presents as on the day of their meeting, for, he said, \"'A gift doth blind the eyes of the wise,' and how much more doth it blind the wicked! Therefore will I give him presents upon presents, perhaps he will let me alone.\" Besides, he did not attach much value to the possessions he had acquired outside of the Holy Land. Such possessions are not a blessing, and he did not hesitate to part with them. Beside the presents which Jacob gave Esau, he also paid out a large sum of money to him for the Cave of Machpelah. Immediately upon his arrival in the Holy Land he sold all he had brought with him from Haran, and a pile of gold was the proceeds of the sale. He spoke to Esau, saying: \"Like me thou hast a share in the Cave of Machpelah, wilt thou take this pile of gold for thy portion therein?\" \"What care I for the Cave?\" returned Esau. \"Gold is what I want,\" and for his share in Machpelah he took the gold realized from the sale of the possessions Jacob had accumulated outside of the Holy Land. But God \"filled the vacuum without delay,\" and Jacob was as rich as before. Wealth was not an object of desire to Jacob. He would have been well content, in his own behalf and in behalf of his family, to resign all earthly treasures in favor of Esau and his family. He said to Esau: \"I foresee that in future days suffering will be inflicted by thy children upon mine. But I do not demur, thou mayest exercise thy dominion and wear thy crown until the time when the Messiah springs from my loins, and receives the rule from thee.\" These words spoken by Jacob will be realized in days to come, when all the nations will rise up against the kingdom of Edom, and take away one city after another from him, one realm after another, until they reach Bet-Gubrin, and then the Messiah will appear and assume his kingship. The angel of Edom will flee for refuge to Bozrah, but God will appear there, and slay him, for though Bozrah is one of the cities of refuge, yet will the Lord exercise the right of the avenger therein. He will seize the angel by his hair, and Elijah will slaughter him, letting the blood spatter the garments of God. All this Jacob had in mind when he said to Esau, \"Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.\" Jacob himself never went to Seir. What he meant was the Messianic time when Israel shall go to Seir, and take possession thereof. Jacob tarried in Succoth a whole year, and he opened a house of learning there. Then he journeyed on to Shechem, while Esau betook himself to Seir, saying to himself, \"How long shall I be a burden to my brother?\" for it was during Jacob's sojourn at Succoth that Esau received daily presents from Jacob. And Jacob, after abiding these many years in a strange land, came to Shechem in peace, unimpaired in mind and body. He had forgotten none of the knowledge he had acquired before; the gifts he gave to Esau did not encroach upon his wealth; the injury inflicted by the angel that wrestled with him had been healed, and likewise his children were sound and healthy. Jacob entered Shechem on a Friday, late in the afternoon, and his first concern was to lay out the boundaries of the city, that the laws of the Sabbath might not be transgressed. As soon as he was settled in the place, he sent presents to the notables. A man must be grateful to a city from which he derives benefits. No less did the common people enjoy his bounty. For them he opened a market where he sold all wares at low prices. Also he lost no time in buying a parcel of ground, for it is the duty of every man of substance who comes to the Holy Land from outside to make himself the possessor of land there. He gave a hundred lambs for his estate, a hundred yearling sheep, and a hundred pieces of money, and received in return a bill of sale, to which he attached his signature, using the letters Yod-He for it. And then he erected an altar to God upon his land, and he said, \"Thou art the Lord of all celestial things, and I am the lord of all earthly things.\" But God said, \"Not even the overseer of the synagogue arrogates privileges in the synagogue, and thou assumest lordship with a high hand? Forsooth, on the morrow thy daughter will go abroad, and she shall be humbled.\"",

      "title": "The Outrage At Shechem",
      "content": "While Jacob and his sons were sitting in the house of learning, occupied with the study of the Torah, Dinah went abroad to see the dancing and singing women, whom Shechem had hired to dance and play in the streets in order to entice her forth. Had she remained at home, nothing would have happened to her. But she was a woman, and all women like to show themselves in the street. When Shechem caught sight of her, he seized her by main force, young though she was, and violated her in beastly fashion. This misfortune befell Jacob as a punishment for his excessive self-confidence. In his negotiations with Laban, he had used the expression, \"My righteousness shall answer for me hereafter.\" Besides, on his return to Palestine, when he was preparing to meet his brother, he concealed his daughter Dinah in a chest, lest Esau desire to have her for wife, and he be obliged to give her to him. God spoke to him, saying: \"Herein hast thou acted unkindly toward thy brother, and therefore Dinah will have to marry Job, one that is neither circumcised nor a proselyte. Thou didst refuse to give her to one that is circumcised, and one that is uncircumcised will take her. Thou didst refuse to give her to Esau in lawful wedlock, and now she will fall a victim to the ravisher's illicit passion.\" When Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter, he sent twelve servants to fetch Dinah from Shechem's house, but Shechem went out to them with his men, and drove them from his house, and he would not suffer them to come unto Dinah, and he kissed and embraced her before their eyes. Jacob then sent two maidens of his servants' daughters to remain with Dinah in the house of Shechem. Shechem bade three of his friends go to his father Hamor, the son of Haddakum, the son of Pered, and say, \"Get me this damsel to wife.\" Hamor tried at first to persuade his son not to take a Hebrew woman to wife, but when Shechem persisted in his request, he did according to the word of his son, and went forth to communicate with Jacob concerning the matter. In the meanwhile the sons of Jacob returned from the field, and, kindled with wrath, they spoke unto their father, saying, \"Surely death is due to this man and his household, because the Lord God of the whole earth commanded Noah and his children that man shall never rob nor commit adultery. Now, behold, Shechem has ravaged and committed fornication with our sister, and not one of all the people of the city spake a word to him.\" And whilst they were speaking, Hamor came to speak to Jacob the words of his son concerning Dinah, and after he ceased to speak, Shechem himself came to Jacob and repeated the request made by his father. Simon and Levi answered Hamor and Shechem deceitfully, saying: \"All you have spoken unto us we will do. And, behold, our sister is in your house, but keep away from her until we send to our father Isaac concerning this matter, for we can do nothing without his counsel. He knows the ways of our father Abraham, and whatever he saith unto us we will tell you, we will conceal nothing from you.\" Shechem and his father went home thereafter, satisfied with the result achieved, and when they had gone, the sons of Jacob asked him to seek counsel and pretext in order to kill all the inhabitants of the city, who had deserved this punishment on account of their wickedness. Then Simon said to them: \"I have good counsel to give you. Bid them be circumcised. If they consent not, we shall take our daughter from them, and go away. And if they consent to do this, then, when they are in pain, we shall attack them and slay them.\" The next morning Shechem and his father came again to Jacob, to speak concerning Dinah, and the sons of Jacob spoke deceitfully to them, saying: \"We told our father Isaac all your words, and your words pleased him, but he said, that thus did Abraham his father command him from God, that any man that is not of his descendants, who desireth to take one of his daughters to wife, shall cause every male belonging to him to be circumcised.\" Shechem and his father hastened to do the wishes of the sons of Jacob, and they persuaded also the men of the city to do likewise, for they were greatly esteemed by them, being the princes of the land. On the next day, Shechem and his father rose up early in the morning, and they assembled all the men of the city, and they called for the sons of Jacob, and they circumcised Shechem, his father, his five brothers, and all the males in the city, six hundred and forty-five men and two hundred and seventy-six lads. Haddakum, the grandfather of Shechem, and his six brothers would not be circumcised, and they were greatly incensed against the people of the city for submitting to the wishes of the sons of Jacob. In the evening of the second day, Shechem and his father sent to have eight little children whom their mothers had concealed brought to them to be circumcised. Haddakum and his six brothers sprang at the messengers, and sought to slay them, and sought to slay also Shechem, Hamor, and Dinah. They chided Shechem and his father for doing a thing that their fathers had never done, which would raise the ire of the inhabitants of the land of Canaan against them, as well as the ire of all the children of Ham, and that on account of a Hebrew woman. Haddakum and his brothers finished by saying: \"Behold, to-morrow we will go and assemble our Canaanitish brethren, and we will come and smite you and all in whom you trust, that there shall not be a remnant left of you or them.\" When Hamor and his son Shechem and all the people of the city heard this, they were sore afraid, and they repented what they had done, and Shechem and his father answered Haddakum and his brothers: \"Because we saw that the Hebrews would not accede to our wishes concerning their daughter, we did this thing, but when we shall have obtained our request from them, we will then do unto them that which is in your hearts and in ours, as soon as we shall become strong.\" Dinah, who heard their words, hastened and dispatched one of her maidens whom her father had sent to take care of her in Shechem's house, and informed Jacob and his sons of the conspiracy plotted against them. When the sons of Jacob heard this, they were filled with wrath, and Simon and Levi swore, and said, \"As the Lord liveth, by to-morrow there shall not be a remnant left In the whole city.\" They began the extermination by killing eighteen of the twenty young men who had concealed themselves and were not circumcised, and two of them fled and escaped to some lime pits that were in the city. Then Simon and Levi slew all the city, not leaving a male over, and while they were looking for spoils outside of the city, three hundred women rose against them and threw stones and dust upon them, but Simon single-handed slew them all, and returned to the city, where he joined Levi. Then they took away from the people outside of the city their sheep, their oxen, their cattle, and also the women and the little children, and they led all these away, and took them to the city to their father Jacob. The number of women whom they did not slay, but only took captive, was eighty-five virgins, among them a young damsel of great beauty by the name of Bunah, whom Simon took to wife. The number of the males which they took captive and did not slay was forty-seven, and all these men and women were servants to the sons of Jacob, and to their children after them, until the day they left Egypt.",

      "content": "When Simon and Levi had gone from the city, the two young men who had concealed themselves in the lime pits, and were not slain amongst the people of the city, rose up, and they found the city desolate, without a man, only weeping women, and they cried out, saying, \"Behold, this is the evil which the sons of Jacob did who destroyed one of the Canaanite cities, and were not afraid of all the land of Canaan.\" They left the city and went to Tappuah, and told the inhabitants all that the sons of Jacob had done to the city of Shechem. Jashub, the king of Tappuah, sent to Shechem to see whether these young men told the truth, for he did not believe them, saying, \"How could two men destroy a large city like Shechem?\" The messengers of Jashub returned, and they reported, \"The city is destroyed, not a man is left there, only weeping women, neither are there flocks and cattle there, for all that was in the city was taken away by the sons of Jacob.\" Jashub wondered thereat, for the like had not been heard from the days of Nimrod, and not even from the remotest times, that two men should be able to destroy so large a city, and he decided to go to war against the Hebrews, and avenge the cause of the people of Shechem. His counsellors said to him: \"If two of them laid waste a whole city, surely if thou goest against them, they all will rise up against us, and destroy us. Therefore, send to the kings round about, that we all together fight against the sons of Jacob, and prevail against them.\" The seven kings of the Amorites, when they heard the evil that the sons of Jacob had done to the city of Shechem, assembled together, with all their armies, ten thousand men, with drawn swords, and they came to fight against the sons of Jacob. And Jacob was greatly afraid, and he said to Simon and Levi, \"Why have you brought such evil upon me? I was at rest, and you provoked the inhabitants of the land against me by your acts.\" Then Judah spoke to his father: \"Was it for naught that Simon and Levi killed the inhabitants of Shechem? Verily, it was because Shechem dishonored our sister, and transgressed the command of our God to Noah and his children, and not one of the inhabitants of the city interfered in the matter. Now, why art thou afraid, and why art thou displeased at my brethren? Surely, our God, who delivered the city of Shechem and its people into their hand, He will also deliver into our hands all the Canaanitish kings who are coming against us. Now cast away thy fears, and pray to God to assist us and deliver us.\" Judah then addressed his brethren, saying: \"The Lord our God is with us! Fear naught, then! Stand ye forth, each man girt with his weapons of war, his bow and his sword, and we will go and fight against the uncircumcised. The Lord is our God, He will save us.\" Jacob, his eleven sons, and one hundred servants belonging to Isaac, who had come to their assistance, marched forward to meet the Amorites, a people exceedingly numerous, like unto the sand upon the sea-shore. The sons of Jacob sent unto their grandfather Isaac, at Hebron, requesting him to pray unto the Lord to protect them from the hand of the Canaanites, and he prayed as follows: \"O Lord God, Thou didst promise my father, saying, I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and also me Thou didst promise that Thou wouldst establish Thy word to my father. Now, O Lord, God of the whole world, pervert, I pray Thee, the counsel of these kings, that they may not fight against my sons, and impress the hearts of their kings and their people with the terror of my sons, and bring down their pride that they turn away from my sons. Deliver my sons and their servants from them with Thy strong hand and outstretched arm, for power and might are in Thy hands to do all this.\" Jacob also prayed unto God, and said: \"O Lord God, powerful and exalted God, who hast reigned from days of old, from then until now and forever! Thou art He who stirreth up wars and causeth them to cease. In Thy hand are power and might to exalt and to bring low. O may my prayer be acceptable unto Thee, that Thou mayest turn to me with Thy mercies, to impress the hearts of these kings and their people with the terror of my sons, and terrify them and their camps, and with Thy great kindness deliver all those that trust in Thee, for Thou art He who subdues the peoples under us, and the nations under our feet.\" God heard the prayers of Isaac and Jacob, and He filled the hearts of all the advisers of the Canaanite kings with great fear and terror, and when the kings, who were undecided whether to undertake a campaign against the sons of Jacob, consulted them, they said: \"Are you silly, or is there no understanding in you, that you propose to fight with the Hebrews? Why do you take delight in your own destruction this day? Behold, two of them came to the city of Shechem without fear or terror, and they put all the inhabitants of the city to the sword, no man stood up against them, and how will you be able to fight with them all?\" The royal counsellors then proceeded to enumerate all the mighty things God had done for Abraham, Jacob, and the sons of Jacob, such as had not been done from days of old and by any of the gods of the nations. When the kings heard all the words of their advisers, they were afraid of the sons of Jacob, and they would not fight against them. They turned back with their armies on that day, each to his own city. But the sons of Jacob kept their station that day till evening, and seeing that the kings did not advance to do battle with them in order to avenge the inhabitants of Shechem whom they had killed, they returned home. The wrath of the Lord descended upon the inhabitants of Shechem to the uttermost on account of their wickedness. For they had sought to do unto Sarah and Rebekah as they did unto Dinah, but the Lord had prevented them. Also they had persecuted Abraham when he was a stranger, and they had vexed his flocks when they were big with young, and Eblaen, one born in his house, they had handled most shamefully. And thus they did to all strangers, taking away their wives by force.",

      "content": "The destruction of Shechem by Simon and Levi terrified the heathen all around. If two sons of Jacob had succeeded in ruining a great city like Shechem, they argued, what would Jacob and all his sons accomplish acting together? Jacob meanwhile left Shechem, hindered by none, and with all his possessions he set out, to betake himself to his father Isaac. But after an eight days' march he encountered a powerful army, which had been dispatched from Nineveh to levy tribute upon the whole world and subjugate it. On coming in the vicinity of Shechem, this army heard to what the city had been exposed at the hands of the sons of Jacob, and fury seized the men, and they resolved to make war upon Jacob. But Jacob said to his sons: \"Fear not, God will be your helper, and He will fight for you against your enemies. Only you must put away from you the strange gods in your possession, and you must purify yourselves, and wash your garments clean.\" Girt with his sword, Jacob advanced against the enemy, and in the first onslaught he slew twelve thousand of the weak in the army. Then Judah spake to him, and said, \"Father, thou art tired and exhausted, let me fight the enemy alone.\" And Jacob replied, saying, \"Judah, my son, I know thy strength and thy bravery, that they are exceeding great, so that none in the world is like unto thee therein.\" His countenance like a lion's and inflamed with wrath, Judah attacked the army, and slew twelve myriads of tried and famous warriors. The battle raged hot in front and in the rear, and Levi his brother hastened to his aid, and together they won a victory over the Ninevites. Judah alone slew five thousand more soldiers, and Levi dealt blows right and left with such vigor that the men of the enemy's army fell like grain under the scythe of the reaper. Alarmed about their fate, the people of Nineveh said: \"How long shall we fight with these devils? Let us return to our land, lest they exterminate us root and branch, without leaving a remnant.\" But their king desired to restrain them, and he said: \"O ye heroes, ye men of might and valor, have you lost your senses that you ask to return to your land? Is this your bravery? After you have subdued many kingdoms and countries, ye are not able to hold out against twelve men? If the nations and the kings whom we have made tributary to ourselves hear of this, they will rise up against us as a man, and make a laughing-stock of us, and do with us according to their desire. Take courage, ye men of the great city of Nineveh, that your honor and your name be exalted, and you become not a mockery in the mouth of your enemies.\" These words of their king inspired the warriors to continue the campaign. They sent messengers to all the lands to ask for help, and, reinforced by their allies, the Ninevites assaulted Jacob a second time. He spoke to his sons, saying, \"Take courage and be men, fight against your enemies.\" His twelve sons then took up their stand in twelve different places, leaving considerable intervals between one and another, and Jacob, a sword in his right hand and a bow in his left, advanced to the combat. It was a desperate encounter for him. He had to ward off the enemy to the right and the left. Nevertheless he inflicted a severe blow, and when a band of two thousand men beset him, he leapt up in the air and over them and vanished from their sight. Twenty-two myriads he slew on this day, and when evening came he planned to flee under cover of darkness. But suddenly ninety thousand men appeared, and he was compelled to continue the fight. He rushed at them with his sword, but it broke, and he had to defend himself by grinding huge rocks into lime powder, and this he threw at the enemy and blinded them so that they could see nothing. Luckily, darkness was about to fall, and he could permit himself to take rest for the night. In the morning, Judah said to Jacob, \"Father, thou didst fight the whole of yesterday, and thou art weary and exhausted. Let me fight this day.\" When the warriors caught sight of Judah's lion face and his lion teeth, and heard his lion voice, they were greatly afraid. Judah hopped and jumped over the army like a flea, from one warrior to the next, raining blows down upon them incessantly, and by evening he had slain eighty thousand and ninety-six men, armed with swords and bows. But fatigue overcame him, and Zebulon took up his station at his brother's left hand, and mowed down eighty thousand of the enemy. Meantime Judah regained some of his strength, and, rising up in wrath and fury, and gnashing his teeth with a noise like unto thunder claps in midsummer, he put the army to flight. It ran a distance of eighteen miles, and Judah could enjoy a respite that night. But the army reappeared on the morrow, ready for battle again, to take revenge on Jacob and his children. They blew their trumpets, whereupon Jacob spake to his sons, \"Go forth and fight with your enemies.\" Issachar and Gad said that this day they would take the combat upon themselves, and their father bade them do it while their brothers kept guard and held themselves in readiness to aid and relieve the two combatants when they showed signs of weariness and exhaustion. The leaders of the day slew forty-eight thousand warriors, and put to flight twelve myriads more, who concealed themselves in a cave. Issachar and Gad fetched trees from the woods, piled the trunks up in front of the opening of the cave, and set fire to them. When the fire blazed with a fierce flame, the warriors spoke, saying: \"Why should we stay in this cave and perish with the smoke and the heat? Rather will we go forth and fight with our enemies, then we may have a chance of saving ourselves.\" They left the cave, going through openings at the side, and they attacked Issachar and Gad in front and behind. Dan and Naphtali saw the plight of their brothers and ran to their assistance. They laid about with their swords, hewing a way for themselves to Issachar and Gad, and, united with them, they, too, opposed the foe. It was the third day of the conflict, and the Ninevites were reinforced by an army as numerous as the sand on the sea-shore. All the sons of Jacob united to oppose it, and they routed the host. But when they pursued after the enemy, the fugitives faced about and resumed the battle, saying: \"Why should we run away? Let us rather fight them, perhaps we may be victorious, now they are weary.\" A stubborn combat ensued, and when Jacob saw the vehement attack upon his children, he himself sprang into the thick of the battle and dealt blows right and left. Nevertheless the heathen were victorious, and succeeded in separating Judah from his brethren. As soon as Jacob was aware of the peril of his son, he whistled, and Judah responded, and his brethren hastened to his aid. Judah was fatigued and parched with thirst, and there was no water for him to drink, but he dug his finger into the ground with such force that water gushed out in the sight of the whole army. Then said one warrior to another, \"I will flee before these devils, for God fights on their side,\" and he and all the army fled precipitately, pursued by the sons of Jacob. Soldiers without number they slew, and then they went back to their tents. On their return they noticed that Joseph was missing, and they feared he had been killed or taken captive. Naphtali ran after the retreating enemy, to make search for Joseph, and he found him still fighting against the Ninevite army. He joined Joseph, and killed countless soldiers, and of the fugitives many drowned, and the men that were besetting Joseph ran off and left him in safety. At the end of the war Jacob continued his journey, unhindered, to his father Isaac.",

      "content": "At first the people that lived round about Shechem made no attempt to molest Jacob, who had returned thither after a while, together with his household, to take up his abode there and establish himself. But at the end of seven years the heathen began to harass him. The kings of the Amorites assembled together against the sons of Jacob to slay them in the Valley of Shechem. \"Is it not enough,\" they said, \"that they have slain all the men of Shechem? Should they be permitted now to take possession of their land, too?\" and they advanced to render battle. Judah leapt into the midst of the ranks of the foot soldiers of the allied kings, and slew first of all Jashub, the king of Tappuah, who was clad in iron and brass from top to toe. The king was mounted, and from his horse he cast his spears downward with both hands, in front of him and in back, without ever missing his aim, for he was a mighty warrior, and he could throw javelins with one hand or the other. Nevertheless Judah feared neither him nor his prowess. He ran toward him, snatching a stone of sixty sela'im from the ground and hurling it at him. Jashub was at a distance of one hundred and seventy-seven ells and one-third of an ell, and, protected with iron armor and throwing spears, he moved forward upon Judah. But Judah struck him on his shield with the stone, and unhorsed him. When the king attempted to rise, Judah hastened to his side to slay him before he could get on his feet. But Jashub was nimble, he stood ready to attack Judah, shield to shield, and he drew his sword to cut off Judah's head. Quickly Judah raised his shield to catch the blow upon it, but it broke in pieces. What did Judah now? He wrested the shield of his opponent away from him, and swung his sword against Jashub's feet, cutting them off above the ankles. The king fell prostrate, his sword slipped from his grasp, and Judah hastened to him and severed his head from his body. While Judah was removing the armor of his slain adversary, nine of Jashub's followers appeared. Judah slung a stone against the head of the first of them that approached him, with such force that he dropped his shield, which Judah snatched from the ground and used to defend himself against his eight assailants. His brother Levi came and stood next to him, and shot off an arrow that killed Elon, king of Gaash, and then Judah killed the eight men. And his father Jacob came and killed Zerori king of Shiloh. None of the heathen could prevail against these sons of Jacob, they had not the courage to stand up before them, but took to flight, and the sons of Jacob pursued after them, and each slew a thousand men of the Amorites on that day, before the going down of the sun. And the other sons of Jacob set forth from the Hill of Shechem, where they had taken up their stand, and they also pursued after them as far as Hazor. Before this city they had another severe encounter with the enemy, more severe than that in the Valley of Shechem. Jacob let his arrows fly, and slew Pirathon king of Hazor, and then Pasusi king of Sartan, Laban king of Aram, and Shebir king of Mahanaim. Judah was the first to mount the walls of Hazor. As he approached the top, four warriors attacked him, but he slew them without stopping in his ascent, and before his brother Naphtali could bring him succor. Naphtali followed him, and the two stood upon the wall, Judah to the right and Naphtali to the left, and thence they dealt out death to the warriors. The other sons of Jacob followed their two brothers in turn, and made an end of exterminating the heathen host on that day. They subjugated Hazor, slew the warriors thereof, let no man escape with his life, and despoiled the city of all therein. On the day following they went to Sartan, and again a bloody battle took place. Sartan was situated upon high land, and the hill before the city was likewise very high, so that none could come near unto it, and also none could come near unto the citadel, because the wall thereof was high. Nevertheless they made themselves masters of the city. They scaled the walls of the citadel, Judah on the east side being the first to ascend, then Gad on the west side, Simon and Levi on the north, and Reuben and Dan on the south, and Naphtali and Issachar set fire to the hinges upon which the gates of the city were hung. In the same way the sons of Jacob subdued five other cities, Tappuah, Arbel, Shiloh, Mahanaim, and Gaash, making an end of all of them in five days. On the sixth day all the Amorites assembled, and they came to Jacob and his sons unarmed, bowed down before them, and sued for peace. And the sons of Jacob made peace with the heathen, who ceded Timna to them, and all the land of Harariah. In that day also Jacob concluded peace with them, and they made restitution to the sons of Jacob for all the cattle they had taken, two head for one, and they restored all the spoil they had carried off. And Jacob turned to go to Timna, and Judah went to Arbel, and thenceforth the Amorites troubled them no more.",

      "content": "If a man voweth a vow, and he does not fulfil it in good time, he will stumble through three grave sins, idolatry, unchastity, and bloodshed. Jacob had been guilty of not accomplishing promptly the vow he had taken upon himself at Beth-el, and therefore punishment overtook him—his daughter was dishonored, his sons slew men, and they kept the idols found among the spoils of Shechem. Therefore, when Jacob prostrated himself before God after the bloody outrage at Shechem, He bade him arise, and go to Beth-el and accomplish the vow he had vowed there. Before Jacob set out for the holy place to do the bidding of God, he took the idols which were in the possession of his sons, and the teraphim which Rachel had stolen from her father, and he shivered them in pieces, and buried the bits under an oak upon Mount Gerizim, uprooting the tree with one hand, concealing the remains of the idols in the hollow left in the earth, and planting the oak again with one hand. Among the destroyed idols was one in the form of a dove, and this the Samaritans dug up later and worshipped. On reaching Beth-el he erected an altar to the Lord, and on a pillar he set up the stone whereon he had rested his head during the night which he had passed there on his journey to Haran. Then he bade his parents come to Beth-el and take part in his sacrifice. But Isaac sent him a message, saying, \"O my son Jacob, that I might see thee before I die,\" whereupon Jacob hastened to his parents, taking Levi and Judah with him. When his grandchildren stepped before Isaac, the darkness that shrouded his eyes dropped away, and he said, \"My son, are these thy children, for they resemble thee?\" And the spirit of prophecy entered his mouth, and he grasped Levi with his right hand and Judah with his left in order to bless them, and he spoke these words to Levi: \"May the Lord bring thee and thy seed nigh unto Him before all flesh, that ye serve in His sanctuary like the Angel of the Face and the Holy Angels. Princes, judges, and rulers shall they be unto all the seed of the children of Jacob. The word of God they will proclaim in righteousness, and all His judgments they will execute in justice, and they will make manifest His ways unto the children of Jacob, and unto Israel His paths.\" And unto Judah he spake, saying: \"Be ye princes, thou and one of thy sons, over the sons of Jacob. In thee shall be the help of Jacob, and the salvation of Israel shall be found in thee. And when thou sittest upon the throne of the glory of thy justice, perfect peace shall reign over all the seed of the children of my beloved Abraham.\" On the morrow, Isaac told his son that he would not accompany him to Beth-el on account of his great age, but he bade him not delay longer to fulfil his vow, and gave him permission to take his mother Rebekah with him to the holy place. And Rebekah and her nurse Deborah went to Beth-el with Jacob.",

      "content": "Deborah, the nurse of Rebekah, and some of the servants of Isaac had been sent to Jacob by his mother, while he still abode with Laban, to summon him home at the end of his fourteen years' term of service. As Jacob did not at once obey his mother's behest, the two servants of Isaac returned to their master, but Deborah remained with Jacob then and always. Therefore, when Deborah died in Beth-el, Jacob mourned for her, and he buried her below Beth-el under the palm-tree, the same under which the prophetess Deborah sat later, when the children of Israel came to her for judgment. But a short time elapsed after the death of the nurse Deborah, and Rebekah died, too. Her passing away was not made the occasion for public mourning. The reason was that, as Abraham was dead, Isaac blind, and Jacob away from home, there remained Esau as the only mourner to appear in public and represent her family, and beholding that villain, it was feared, might tempt a looker-on to cry out, \"Accursed be the breasts that gave thee suck.\" To avoid this, the burial of Rebekah took place at night. God appeared unto Jacob to comfort him in his grief, and with Him appeared the heavenly family. It was a sign of grace, for all the while the sons of Jacob had been carrying idols with them the Lord had not revealed Himself to Jacob. At this time God announced to Jacob the birth of Benjamin soon to occur, and the birth of Manasseh and Ephraim, who also were to be founders of tribes, and furthermore He told him that these three would count kings among their descendants, Saul and Ish-bosheth, of the seed of Benjamin, Jeroboam the Ephraimite, and Jehu of the tribe of Manasseh. In this vision, God confirmed the change of his name from Jacob to Israel, promised him by the angel with whom he had wrestled on entering the Holy Land, and finally God revealed to him that he would be the last of the three with whose names the Name of God would appear united, for God is called only the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and never the God of any one else. In token of this revelation from God, Jacob set up a pillar of stone, and he poured out a drink offering thereon, as in a later day the priests were to offer libations in the Temple on the Feast of Tabernacles, and the libation brought by Jacob at Beth-el was as much as all the waters in the Sea of Tiberias. At the time when Deborah and Rebekah died, occurred also the death of Rachel, at the age of thirty-six, but not before her prayer was heard, that she bear Jacob a second son, for she died in giving birth to Benjamin. Twelve years she had borne no child, then she fasted twelve days, and her petition was granted her. She brought forth the youngest son of Jacob, whom he called Benjamin, the son of days, because he was born in his father's old age, and with him a twin sister was born. Rachel was buried in the way to Ephrath, because Jacob, gifted with prophetic spirit, foresaw that the exiles would pass this place on their march to Babylon, and as they passed, Rachel would entreat God's mercy for the poor outcasts. Jacob journeyed on to Jerusalem. During Rachel's lifetime, her couch had always stood in the tent of Jacob. After her death, he ordered the couch of her handmaid Bilhah to be carried thither. Reuben was sorely vexed thereat, and he said, \"Not enough that Rachel alive curtailed the rights of my mother, she must needs give her annoyance also after death!\" He went and took the couch of his mother Leah and placed it in Jacob's tent instead of Bilhah's couch. Reuben's brothers learned of his disrespectful act from Asher. He had found it out in one way or another, and had told it to his brethren, who ruptured their relations with him, for they would have nothing to do with an informer, and they did not become reconciled with Asher until Reuben himself confessed his transgression. For it was not long before Reuben recognized that he had acted reprehensibly toward his father, and he fasted and put on sackcloth, and repented of his misdeed. He was the first among men to do penance, and therefore God said to him: \"Since the beginning of the world it hath not happened that a man hath sinned and then repented thereof. Thou art the first to do penance, and as thou livest, a prophet of thy seed, Hosea, shall be the first to proclaim, 'O Israel, return.' \"",

      "content": "When Isaac felt his end approaching, he called his two sons to him, and charged them with his last wish and will, and gave them his blessing. He said: \"I adjure you by the exalted Name, the praised, honored, glorious, immutable, and mighty One, who hath made heaven and earth and all things together, that ye fear Him, and serve Him, and each shall love his brother in mercy and justice, and none wish evil unto the other, now and henceforth unto all eternity, all the days of your life, that ye may enjoy good fortune in all your undertakings, and that ye perish not.\" Furthermore he commanded them to bury him in the Cave of Machpelah, by the side of his father Abraham, in the grave which he had dug for himself with his own hands. Then he divided his possessions between his two sons, giving Esau the larger portion, and Jacob the smaller. But Esau said, \"I sold my birthright to Jacob, and I ceded it to him, and it belongs unto him.\" Isaac rejoiced greatly that Esau acknowledged the rights of Jacob of his own accord, and he closed his eyes in peace. The funeral of Isaac was not disturbed by any unseemly act, for Esau was sure of his heritage in accordance with the last wishes expressed by his father. But when the time came to divide Isaac's possessions between the two brothers, Esau said to Jacob, \"Divide the property of our father into two portions, but I as the elder claim the right of choosing the portion I desire.\" What did Jacob do? He knew well that \"the eye of the wicked never beholds treasures enough to satisfy it,\" so he divided their common heritage in the following way: all the material possessions of his father formed one portion, and the other consisted of Isaac's claim upon the Holy Land, together with the Cave of Machpelah, the tomb of Abraham and Isaac. Esau chose the money and the other things belonging to Isaac for his inheritance, and to Jacob were left the Cave and the title to the Holy Land. An agreement to this effect was drawn up in writing in due form, and on the strength of the document Jacob insisted upon Esau's leaving Palestine. Esau acquiesced, and he and his wives and his sons and daughters journeyed to Mount Seir, where they took up their abode. Though Esau gave way before Jacob for the nonce, he returned to the land to make war upon his brother. Leah had just died, and Jacob and the sons borne by Leah were mourning for her, and the rest of his sons, borne unto him by his other wives, were trying to comfort them, when Esau came upon them with a powerful host of four thousand men, well equipped for war, clad in armor of iron and brass, all furnished with bucklers, bows, and swords. They surrounded the citadel wherein Jacob and his sons dwelt at that time with their servants and children and households, for they had all assembled to console Jacob for the death of Leah, and they sat there unconcerned, none entertained a suspicion that an assault upon them was meditated by any man. And the great army had already encircled their castle, and still none within suspected any harm, neither Jacob and his children nor the two hundred servants. Now when Jacob saw that Esau presumed to make war upon them, and sought to slay them in the citadel, and was shooting darts at them, he ascended the wall of the citadel and spake words of peace and friendship and brotherly love to Esau. He said: \"Is this the consolation which thou hast come to bring me, to comfort me for my wife, who hath been taken by death? Is this in accordance with the oath thou didst swear twice unto thy father and thy mother before they died? Thou hast violated thy oath, and in the hour when thou didst swear unto thy father, thou wast judged.\" But Esau made reply: \"Neither the children of men nor the beasts of the field swear an oath to keep it unto all eternity, but on every day they devise evil against one another, when it is directed against an enemy, or when they seek to slay an adversary. If the boar will change his skin and make his bristles as soft as wool, or if he can cause horns to sprout forth on his head like the horns of a stag or a ram, then shall I observe the tie of brotherhood with thee.\" Then spoke Judah to his father Jacob, saying: \"How long wilt thou stand yet wasting words of peace and friendship upon him? And he attacks us unawares, like an enemy, with his mail-clad warriors, seeking to slay us.\" Hearing these words, Jacob grasped his bow and killed Adoram the Edomite, and a second time he bent his bow, and the arrow struck Esau upon the right thigh. The wound was mortal, and his sons lifted Esau up and put him upon his ass, and he came to Adora, and there he died. Judah made a sally to the south of the citadel, and with him were Naphtali and Gad, aided by fifty of Jacob's servants; to the east Levi and Dan went forth with fifty servants; Reuben, Issachar, and Zebulon with fifty servants, to the north; and Simon, Benjamin, and Enoch, the last the son of Reuben, with fifty servants, to the west. Judah was exceedingly brave in battle. Together with Naphtali and Gad he pressed forward into the ranks of the enemy, and captured one of their iron towers. On their bucklers they caught the sharp missiles hurled against them in such numbers that the light of the sun was darkened by reason of the rocks and darts and stones. Judah was the first to break the ranks of the enemy, of whom he killed six valiant men, and he was accompanied on the right by Naphtali and by Gad on the left. They also hewed down two soldiers each, while their troop of servants killed one man each. Nevertheless they did not succeed in forcing the army away from the south of the citadel, not even when all together, Judah and his brethren, made an united attack upon the enemy, each of them picking out a victim and slaying him. And they were still unsuccessful in a third combined attack, though this time each killed two men. When Judah saw now that the enemy remained in possession of the field, and it was impossible to dislodge them, he girded himself with strength, and an heroic spirit animated him. Judah, Naphtali, and Gad united, and together they pierced the ranks of the enemy, Judah slaying ten of them, and his brothers each eight. Seeing this, the servants took courage, and they joined their leaders and fought at their side. Judah laid about him to right and to left, always aided by Naphtali and Gad, and so they succeeded in forcing the enemy one ris further to the south, away from the citadel. But the hostile army recovered itself, and maintained a brave stand against all the sons of Jacob, who were faint from the hardships of the combat, and could not continue to fight. Thereupon Judah turned to God in prayer, and God hearkened unto his petition, and He helped them. He set loose a storm from one of His treasure chambers, and it blew into the faces of the enemy, and filled their eyes with darkness, and they could not see how to fight. But Judah and his brothers could see clearly, for the wind blew upon their backs. Now Judah and his two brothers wrought havoc among them, they hewed the enemy down as the reaper mows down the stalks of grain and heaps them up for sheaves. After they had routed the division of the army assigned to them on the south, they hastened to the aid of their brothers, who were defending the east, north, and west of the citadel with three companies. On each side the wind blew into the faces of the enemy, and so the sons of Jacob succeeded in annihilating their army. Four hundred were slain in battle, and six hundred fled, among the latter Esau's four sons, Reuel, Jeush, Lotan, and Korah. The oldest of his sons, Eliphaz, took no part in the war, because he was a disciple of Jacob, and therefore would not bear arms against him. The sons of Jacob pursued after the fleeing remnant of the army as far as Adora. There the sons of Esau abandoned the body of their father, and continued their flight to Mount Seir. But the sons of Jacob remained in Adora over night, and out of respect for their father they buried the remains of his brother Esau. In the morning they went on in pursuit of the enemy, and besieged them on Mount Seir. Now the sons of Esau and all the other fugitives came and fell down before them, bowed down, and entreated them without cease, until they concluded peace with them. But the sons of Jacob exacted tribute from them.",

      "content": "The worthiest among the sons of Esau was his first-born Eliphaz. He had been raised under the eyes of his grandfather Isaac, from whom he had learnt the pious way of life. The Lord had even found him worthy of being endowed with the spirit of prophecy, for Eliphaz the son of Esau is none other than the prophet Eliphaz, the friend of Job. It was from the life of the Patriarchs that he drew the admonitions which he gave unto Job in his disputes with him. Eliphaz spake: \"Thou didst ween thyself the equal of Abraham, and thou didst marvel, therefore, that God should deal with thee as with the generation of the confusion of tongues. But Abraham stood the test of ten temptations, and thou faintest when but one toucheth thee. When any that was not whole came to thee, thou wouldst console him. To the blind thou wouldst say, If thou didst build thyself a house, thou wouldst surely put windows in it, and if God hath denied thee light, it is but that He may be glorified through thee in the day when 'the eyes of the blind shall be opened.' To the deaf thou wouldst say, If thou didst fashion a water pitcher, thou wouldst surely not forget to make ears for it, and if God created thee without hearing, it is but that He may be glorified through thee in the day when 'the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.' In such wise thou didst endeavor to console the feeble and the maimed. But now it is come unto thee, and thou art troubled. Thou sayest, I am an upright man, why doth He chastise me? But who, I pray thee, ever perished, being innocent? Noah was saved from the flood, Abraham from the fiery furnace, Isaac from the slaughtering knife, Jacob from angels, Moses from the sword of Pharaoh, and Israel from the Egyptians that were drowned in the Sea. Thus shall all the wicked fare.\" Job answered Eliphaz, and said, \"Look at thy father Esau!\" But Eliphaz returned: \"I have nothing to do with him, the son should not bear the iniquity of the father. Esau will be destroyed, because he executed no good deeds, and likewise his dukes will perish. But as for me, I am a prophet, and my message is not unto Esau, but unto thee, to make thee render account of thyself.\" But God rebuked Eliphaz, and said: \"Thou didst speak harsh words unto My servant Job. Therefore shall Obadiah, one of thy descendants, utter a prophecy of denunciation against thy father's house, the Edomites.\" The concubine of Eliphaz was Timna, a princess of royal blood, who had asked to be received into the faith of Abraham and his family, but they all, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, had rejected her, and she said, \"Rather will I be a maid servant unto the dregs of this nation, than mistress of another nation,\" and so she was willing to be concubine to Eliphaz. To punish the Patriarchs for the affront they had offered her, she was made the mother of Amalek, who inflicted great injury upon Israel. Another one of Esau's descendants, Anah, had a most unusual experience. Once when he was pasturing his father's asses in the wilderness, he led them to one of the deserts on the shores of the Red Sea, opposite the wilderness of the nations, and while he was feeding the beasts, a very heavy storm came from the other side of the sea, and the asses could not move. Then about one hundred and twenty great and terrible animals came out from the wilderness at the other side of the sea, and they all came to the place where the asses were, and they placed themselves there. From the middle down, these animals were in the shape of a man, and from the middle up some had the likeness of bears, some of apes, and they all had tails behind them like the tail of the dukipat, from between their shoulders reaching down to the earth. The animals mounted the asses, and they rode away with them, and unto this day no eye hath seen them. One of them approached Anah, and smote him with its tail, and then ran off. When Anah saw all this, he was exceedingly afraid on account of his life, and he fled to the city, where he related all that had happened to him. Many sallied forth to seek the asses, but none could find them. Anah and his brothers went no more to the same place from that day forth, for they were greatly afraid on account of their lives. This Anah was the offspring of an incestuous marriage; his mother was at the same time the mother of his father Zibeon. And as he was born of an unnatural union, so he tried to bring about unnatural unions among animals. He was the first to mix the breed of the horse and the ass and produce the mule. As a punishment, God crossed the snake and the lizard, and they brought forth the habarbar, whose bite is certain death, like the bite of the white she-mule. The descendants of Esau had eight kings before there reigned any king over the descendants of Jacob. But a time came when the Jews had eight kings during whose reign the Edomites had none and were subject to the Jewish kings. This was the time that intervened between Saul, the first Israelitish king, who ruled over Edom, and Jehoshaphat, for Edom did not make itself independent of Jewish rule until the time of Joram, the son of Jehoshaphat. There was a difference between the kings of Esau's seed and the kings of Jacob's seed. The Jewish people always produced their kings from their own midst, while the Edomites had to go to alien peoples to secure theirs. The first Edomite king was the Aramean Balaam, called Bela in his capacity as ruler of Edom. His successor Job, called Jobab also, came from Bozrah, and for furnishing Edom with a king this city will be chastised in time to come. When God sits in judgment on Edom, Bozrah will be the first to suffer punishment. The rule of Edom was of short duration, while the rule of Israel will be unto all times, for the standard of the Messiah shall wave forever and ever. *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LEGENDS OF THE JEWS — VOLUME 1 *** Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™ Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life. Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate. While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org. This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",

      "content": "Jacob was not exempt from the lot that falls to the share of all the pious. Whenever they expect to enjoy life in tranquillity, Satan hinders them. He appears before God, and says: \"Is it not enough that the future world is set apart for the pious? What right have they to enjoy this world, besides?\" After the many hardships and conflicts that had beset the path of Jacob, he thought he would be at rest at last, and then came the loss of Joseph and inflicted the keenest suffering. Verily, few and evil had been the days of the years of Jacob's pilgrimage, for the time spent outside of the Holy Land had seemed joyless to him. Only the portion of his life passed in the land of his fathers, during which he was occupied with making proselytes, in accordance with the example set him by Abraham and Isaac, did he consider worth while having lived, and this happy time was of short duration. When Joseph was snatched away, but eight years had elapsed since his return to his father's house. And yet it was only for the sake of Joseph that Jacob had been willing to undergo all the troubles and the adversity connected with his sojourn in the house of Laban. Indeed, Jacob's blessing in having his quiver full of children was due to the merits of Joseph, and likewise the dividing of the Red Sea and of the Jordan for the Israelites was the reward for his son's piety. For among the sons of Jacob Joseph was the one that resembled his father most closely in appearance, and, also, he was the one to whom Jacob transmitted the instruction and knowledge he had received from his teachers Shem and Eber. The whole course of the son's life is but a repetition of the father's. As the mother of Jacob remained childless for a long time after her marriage, so also the mother of Joseph. As Rebekah had undergone severe suffering in giving birth to Jacob, so Rachel in giving birth to Joseph. As Jacob's mother bore two sons, so also Joseph's mother. Like Jacob, Joseph was born circumcised. As the father was a shepherd, so the son. As the father served for the sake of a woman, so the son served under a woman. Like the father, the son appropriated his older brother's birthright. The father was hated by his brother, and the son was hated by his brethren. The father was the favorite son as compared with his brother, so was the son as compared with his brethren. Both the father and the son lived in the land of the stranger. The father became a servant to a master, also the son. The master whom the father served was blessed by God, so was the master whom the son served. The father and the son were both accompanied by angels, and both married their wives outside of the Holy Land. The father and the son were both blessed with wealth. Great things were announced to the father in a dream, so also to the son. As the father went to Egypt and put an end to famine, so the son. As the father exacted the promise from his sons to bury him in the Holy Land, so also the son. The father died in Egypt, there died also the son. The body of the father was embalmed, also the body of the son. As the father's remains were carried to the Holy Land for interment, so also the remains of the son. Jacob the father provided for the sustenance of his son Joseph during a period of seventeen years, so Joseph the son provided for his father Jacob during a period of seventeen years. Until he was seventeen years old, Joseph frequented the Bet ha-Midrash, and he became so learned that he could impart to his brethren the Halakot he had heard from his father, and in this way he may be regarded as their teacher. He did not stop at formal instruction, he also tried to give them good counsel, and he became the favorite of the sons of the handmaids, who would kiss and embrace him. In spite of his scholarship there was something boyish about Joseph. He painted his eyes, dressed his hair carefully, and walked with a mincing step. These foibles of youth were not so deplorable as his habit of bringing evil reports of his brethren to his father. He accused them of treating the beasts under their care with cruelty—he said that they ate flesh torn from a living animal—and he charged them with casting their eyes upon the daughters of the Canaanites, and giving contemptuous treatment to the sons of the handmaids Bilhah and Zilpah, whom they called slaves. For these groundless accusations Joseph had to pay dearly. He was himself sold as a slave, because he had charged his brethren with having called the sons of the handmaids slaves, and Potiphar's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, because he threw the suspicion upon his brethren that they had cast their eyes upon the Canaanitish women. And how little it was true that they were guilty of cruelty to animals, appears from the fact that at the very time when they were contemplating their crime against Joseph, they yet observed all the rules and prescriptions of the ritual in slaughtering the kid of the goats with the blood of which they besmeared his coat of many colors.",

      "content": "Joseph's talebearing against his brethren made them hate him. Among all of them Gad was particularly wrathful, and for good reason. Gad was a very brave man, and when a beast of prey attacked the herd, over which he kept guard at night, he would seize it by one of its legs, and whirl it around until it was stunned, and then he would fling it away to a distance of two stadia, and kill it thus. Once Jacob sent Joseph to tend the flock, but he remained away only thirty days, for he was a delicate lad and fell sick with the heat, and he hastened back to his father. On his return he told Jacob that the sons of the handmaids were in the habit of slaughtering the choice cattle of the herd and eating it, without obtaining permission from Judah and Reuben. But his report was not accurate. What he had seen was Gad slaughtering one lamb, which he had snatched from the very jaws of a bear, and he killed it because it could not be kept alive after its fright. Joseph's account sounded as though the sons of the handmaids were habitually inconsiderate and careless in wasting their father's substance. To the resentment of the brethren was added their envy of Joseph, because their father loved him more than all of them. Joseph's beauty of person was equal to that of his mother Rachel, and Jacob had but to look at him to be consoled for the death of his beloved wife. Reason enough for distinguishing him among his children. As a token of his great love for him, Jacob gave Joseph a coat of many colors, so light and delicate that it could be crushed and concealed in the closed palm of one hand. The Hebrew name of the garment, Passim, conveys the story of the sale of Joseph. The first letter, Pe, stands for Potiphar, his Egyptian master; Samek stands for Soharim, the merchantmen that bought Joseph from the company of Ishmaelites to whom his brethren had sold him; Yod stands for these same Ishmaelites; and Mem, for the Midianites that obtained him from the merchantmen, and then disposed of him to Potiphar. But Passim. has yet another meaning, \"clefts.\" His brethren knew that the Red Sea would be cleft in twain in days to come for Joseph's sake, and they were jealous of the glory to be conferred upon him. Although they were filled with hatred of him, it must be said in their favor that they were not of a sullen, spiteful nature. They did not hide their feelings, they proclaimed their enmity openly. Once Joseph dreamed a dream, and he could not refrain from telling it to his brethren. He spoke, and said: \"Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed. Behold, you gathered fruit, and so did I. Your fruit rotted, but mine remained sound. Your seed will set up dumb images of idols, but they will vanish at the appearance of my descendant, the Messiah of Joseph. You will keep the truth as to my fate from the knowledge of my father, but I will stand fast as a reward for the self-denial of my mother, and you will prostrate yourselves five times before me.\" The brethren refused at first to listen to the dream, but when Joseph urged them again and again, they gave heed to him, and they said, \"Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us?\" God put an interpretation into their mouths that was to be verified in the posterity of Joseph. Jeroboam and Jehu, two kings, and Joshua and Gideon, two judges, have been among his descendants, corresponding to the double and emphatic expressions used by his brethren in interpreting the dream. Then Joseph dreamed another dream, how the sun, the moon, and eleven stars bowed down before him, and Jacob, to whom he told it first, was rejoiced over it, for he understood its meaning properly. He knew that he himself was designated by the sun, the name by which God had called him when he lodged overnight on the holy site of the Temple. He had heard God say to the angels at that time, \"The sun has come.\" The moon stood for Joseph's mother, and the stars for his brethren, for the righteous are as the stars. Jacob was so convinced of the truth of the dream that he was encouraged to believe that he would live to see the resurrection of the dead, for Rachel was dead, and her return to earth was clearly indicated by the dream. He went astray there, for not Joseph's own mother was referred to, but his foster-mother Bilhah, who had raised him. Jacob wrote the dream in a book, recording all the circumstances, the day, the hour, and the place, for the holy spirit cautioned him, \"Take heed, these things will surely come to pass.\" But when Joseph repeated his dream to his brethren, in the presence of his father, Jacob rebuked him, saying, \"I and thy brethren, that has some sense, but I and thy mother, that is inconceivable, for thy mother is dead.\" These words of Jacob called forth a reproof from God. He said, \"Thus thy descendants will in time to come seek to hinder Jeremiah in delivering his prophecies.\" Jacob may be excused, he had spoken in this way only in order to avert the envy and hate of his brethren from Joseph, but they envied and hated him because they knew that the interpretation put upon the dream by Jacob would be realized.",

      "content": "Once the brethren of Joseph led their father's flocks to the pastures of Shechem, and they intended to take their ease and pleasure there. They stayed away a long time, and no tidings of them were heard. Jacob began to be anxious about the fate of his sons. He feared that a war had broken out between them and the people of Shechem, and he resolved to send Joseph to them and have him bring word again, whether it was well with his brethren. Jacob desired to know also about the flocks, for it is a duty to concern oneself about the welfare of anything from which one derives profit. Though he knew that the hatred of his brethren might bring on unpleasant adventures, yet Joseph, in filial reverence, declared himself ready to go on his father's errand. Later, whenever Jacob remembered his dear son's willing spirit, the recollection stabbed him to the heart. He would say to himself, \"Thou didst know the hatred of thy brethren, and yet thou didst say, Here am I.\" Jacob dismissed Joseph, with the injunction that he journey only by daylight, saying furthermore, \"Go now, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flock; and send me word\"—an unconscious prophecy. He did not say that he expected to see Joseph again, but only to have word from him. Since the covenant of the pieces, God had resolved, on account of Abraham's doubting question, that Jacob and his family should go down into Egypt to dwell there. The preference shown to Joseph by his father, and the envy it aroused, leading finally to the sale of Joseph and his establishment in Egypt, were but disguised means created by God, instead of executing His counsel directly by carrying Jacob down into Egypt as a captive. Joseph reached Shechem, where he expected to find his brethren. Shechem was always a place of ill omen for Jacob and his seed—there Dinah was dishonored, there the Ten Tribes of Israel rebelled against the house of David while Rehoboam ruled in Jerusalem, and there Jeroboam was installed as king. Not finding his brethren and the herd in Shechem, Joseph continued his journey in the direction of the next pasturing place, not far from Shechem, but he lost his way in the wilderness. Gabriel in human shape appeared before him, and asked him, saying, \"What seekest thou?\" And he answered, \"I seek my brethren.\" Whereto the angel replied, \"Thy brethren have given up the Divine qualities of love and mercy. Through a prophetic revelation they learned that the Hivites were preparing to make war upon them, and therefore they departed hence to go to Dothan. And they had to leave this place for other reasons, too. I heard, while I was still standing behind the curtain that veils the Divine throne, that this day the Egyptian bondage would begin, and thou wouldst be the first to be subjected to it.\" Then Gabriel led Joseph to Dothan. When his brethren saw him afar off, they conspired against him, to slay him. Their first plan was to set dogs on him. Simon then spoke to Levi, \"Behold, the master of dreams cometh with a new dream, he whose descendant Jeroboam will introduce the worship of Baal. Come now, therefore, and let us slay him, that we may see what will become of his dreams.\" But God spoke: \"Ye say, We shall see what will become of his dreams, and I say likewise, We shall see, and the future shall show whose word will stand, yours or Mine.\" Simon and Gad set about slaying Joseph, and he fell upon his face, and entreated them: \"Have mercy with me, my brethren, have pity on the heart of my father Jacob. Lay not your hands upon me, to spill innocent blood, for I have done no evil unto you. But if I have done evil unto you, then chastise me with a chastisement, but your hands lay not upon me, for the sake of our father Jacob.\" These words touched Zebulon, and he began to lament and weep, and the wailing of Joseph rose up together with his brother's, and when Simon and Gad raised their hands against him to execute their evil design, Joseph took refuge behind Zebulon, and supplicated his other brethren to have mercy upon him. Then Reuben arose, and he said, \"Brethren, let us not slay him, but let us cast him into one of the dry pits, which our fathers dug without finding water.\" That was due to the providence of God; He had hindered the water from rising in them in order that Joseph's rescue might be accomplished, and the pits remained dry until Joseph was safe in the hands of the Ishmaelites. Reuben had several reasons for interceding in behalf of Joseph. He knew that he as the oldest of the brethren would be held responsible by their father, if any evil befell him. Besides, Reuben was grateful to Joseph for having reckoned him among the eleven sons of Jacob in narrating his dream of the sun, moon, and stars. Since his disrespectful bearing toward Jacob, he had not thought himself worthy of being considered one of his sons. First Reuben tried to restrain his brethren from their purpose, and he addressed them in words full of love and compassion. But when he saw that neither words nor entreaties would change their intention, he begged them, saying: \"My brethren, at least hearken unto me in respect of this, that ye be not so wicked and cruel as to slay him. Lay no hand upon your brother, shed no blood, cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and let him perish thus. Then Reuben went away from his brethren, and he hid in the mountains, so that he might be able to hasten back in a favorable moment and draw Joseph forth from the pit and restore him to his father. He hoped his reward would be pardon for the transgression he had committed against Jacob. His good intention was frustrated, yet Reuben was rewarded by God, for God gives a recompense not only for good deeds, but for good intentions as well. As he was the first of the brethren of Joseph to make an attempt to save him, so the city of Bezer in the tribe of Reuben was the first of the cities of refuge appointed to safeguard the life of the innocent that seek help. Furthermore God spake to Reuben, saying: \"As thou wast the first to endeavor to restore a child unto his father, so Hosea, one of thy descendants, shall be the first to endeavor to lead Israel back to his heavenly Father.\" The brethren accepted Reuben's proposition, and Simon seized Joseph, and cast him into a pit swarming with snakes and scorpions, beside which was another unused pit, filled with offal. As though this were not enough torture, Simon bade his brethren fling great stones at Joseph. In his later dealings with this brother Simon, Joseph showed all the forgiving charitableness of his nature. When Simon was held in durance in Egypt as a hostage, Joseph, so far from bearing him a grudge, ordered crammed poultry to be set before him at all his meals. Not satisfied with exposing Joseph to the snakes and scorpions, his brethren had stripped him bare before they flung him into the pit. They took off his coat of many colors, his upper garment, his breeches, and his shirt. However, the reptiles could do him no harm. God heard his cry of distress, and kept them in hiding in the clefts and the holes, and they could not come near him. From the depths of the pit Joseph appealed to his brethren, saying: \"O my brethren, what have I done unto you, and what is my transgression? Why are you not afraid before God on account of your treatment of me? Am I not flesh of your flesh, and bone of your bone? Jacob your father, is he not also my father? Why do you act thus toward me? And how will you be able to lift up your countenance before Jacob? O Judah, Reuben, Simon, Levi, my brethren, deliver me, I pray you, from the dark place into which you have cast me. Though I committed a trespass against you, yet are ye children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were compassionate with the orphan, gave food to the hungry, and clothed the naked. How, then, can ye withhold your pity from your own brother, your own flesh and bone? And though I sinned against you, yet you will hearken unto my petition for the sake of my father. O that my father knew what my brethren are doing unto me, and what they spake unto me!\" To avoid hearing Joseph's weeping and cries of distress, his brethren passed on from the pit, and stood at a bowshot's distance. The only one among them that manifested pity was Zebulon. For two days and two nights no food passed his lips on account of his grief over the fate of Joseph, who had to spend three days and three nights in the pit before he was sold. During this period Zebulon was charged by his brethren to keep watch at the pit. He was chosen to stand guard because he took no part in the meals. Part of the time Judah also refrained from eating with the rest, and took turns at watching, because he feared Simon and Gad might jump down into the pit and put an end to Joseph's life. While Joseph was languishing thus, his brethren determined to kill him. They would finish their meal first, they said, and then they would fetch him forth and slay him. When they had done eating, they attempted to say grace, but Judah remonstrated with them: \"We are about to take the life of a human being, and yet would bless God? That is not a blessing, that is contemning the Lord. What profit is it if we slay our brother? Rather will the punishment of God descend upon us. I have good counsel to give you. Yonder passeth by a travelling company of Ishmaelites on their way to Egypt. Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him. The Ishmaelites will take him with them upon their journeyings, and he will be lost among the peoples of the earth. Let us follow the custom of former days, for Canaan, too, the son of Ham, was made a slave for his evil deeds, and so will we do with our brother Joseph.\"",

      "content": "While the brethren of Joseph were deliberating upon his fate, seven Midianitish merchantmen passed near the pit in which he lay. They noticed that many birds were circling above it, whence they assumed that there must be water therein, and, being thirsty, they made a halt in order to refresh themselves. When they came close, they heard Joseph screaming and wailing, and they looked down into the pit and saw a youth of beautiful figure and comely appearance. They called to him, saying: \"Who art thou? Who brought thee hither, and who cast thee into this pit in the wilderness?\" They all joined together and dragged him up, and took him along with them when they continued on their journey. They had to pass his brethren, who called out to the Midianites: \"Why have you done such a thing, to steal our slave and carry him away with you? We threw the lad into the pit, because he was disobedient. Now, then, return our slave to us.\" The Midianites replied: \"What, this lad, you say, is your slave, your servant? More likely is it that you all are slaves unto him, for in beauty of form, in pleasant looks, and fair appearance, he excelleth you all. Why, then, will you speak lies unto us? We will not give ear unto your words, nor believe you, for we found the lad in the wilderness, in a pit, and we took him out, and we will carry him away with us on our journey.\" But the sons of Jacob insisted, \"Restore our slave to us, lest you meet death at the edge of the sword.\" Unaffrighted, the Midianites drew their weapons, and, amid war whoops, they prepared to enter into a combat with the sons of Jacob. Then Simon rose up, and with bared sword he sprang upon the Midianites, at the same time uttering a cry that made the earth reverberate. The Midianites fell down in great consternation, and he said: \"I am Simon, the son of the Hebrew Jacob, who destroyed the city of Shechem alone and unaided, and together with my brethren I destroyed the cities of the Amorites. God do so and more also, if it be not true that all the Midianites, your brethren, united with all the Canaanite kings to fight with me, cannot hold out against me. Now restore the boy you took from us, else will I give your flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field.\" The Midianites were greatly afraid of Simon, and, terrified and abashed, they spake to the sons of Jacob with little courage: \"Said ye not that ye cast this lad into the pit because he was of a rebellious spirit? What, now, will ye do with an insubordinate slave? Rather sell him to us, we are ready to pay any price you desire.\" This speech was part of the purpose of God. He had put it into the heart of the Midianites to insist upon possessing Joseph, that he might not remain with his brethren, and be slain by them. The brethren assented, and Joseph was sold as a slave while they sat over their meal. God spake, saying: \"Over a meal did ye sell your brother, and thus shall Ahasuerus sell your descendants to Haman over a meal, and because ye have sold Joseph to be a slave, therefore shall ye say year after year, Slaves were we unto Pharaoh in Egypt.\" The price paid for Joseph by the Midianites was twenty pieces of silver, enough for a pair of shoes for each of his brethren. Thus \"they sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes.\" For so handsome a youth as Joseph the sum paid was too low by far, but his appearance had been greatly changed by the horrible anguish he bad endured in the pit with the snakes and the scorpions. He had lost his ruddy complexion, and he looked sallow and sickly, and the Midianites were justified in paying a small sum for him. The merchantmen had come upon Joseph naked in the pit, for his brethren had stripped him of all his clothes. That he might not appear before men in an unseemly condition, God sent Gabriel down to him, and the angel enlarged the amulet banging from Joseph's neck until it was a garment that covered him entirely. Joseph's brethren were looking after him as he departed with the Midianites, and when they saw him with clothes upon him, they cried after them, \"Give us his raiment! We sold him naked, without clothes.\" His owners refused to yield to their demand, but they agreed to reimburse the brethren with four pairs of shoes, and Joseph kept his garment, the same in which he was arrayed when he arrived in Egypt and was sold to Potiphar, the same in which he was locked up in prison and appeared before Pharaoh, and the same he wore when he was ruler over Egypt. As an atonement for the twenty pieces of silver taken by his brethren in exchange for Joseph, God commanded that every first-born son shall be redeemed by the priest with an equal amount, and, also, every Israelite must pay annually to the sanctuary as much as fell to each of the brethren as his share of the price. The brethren of Joseph bought shoes for the money, for they said: \"We will not eat it, because it is the price for the blood of our brother, but we will tread upon him, for that he spake, he would have dominion over us, and we will see what will become of his dreams.\" And for this reason the ordinance has been commanded, that he who refuseth to raise up a name in Israel unto his brother that hath died without having a son, shall have his shoe loosed from off his foot, and his face shall be spat upon. Joseph's brethren refused to do aught to preserve his life, and therefore the Lord loosed their shoes from off their feet, for, when they went down to Egypt, the slaves of Joseph took their shoes off their feet as they entered the gates, and they prostrated themselves before Joseph as before a Pharaoh, and, as they lay prostrate, they were spat upon, and put to shame before the Egyptians. The Midianites pursued their journey to Gilead, but they soon regretted the purchase they had made. They feared that Joseph had been stolen in the land of the Hebrews, though sold to them as a slave, and if his kinsmen should find him with them, death would be inflicted upon them for the abduction of a free man. The high-handed manner of the sons of Jacob confirmed their suspicion, that they might be capable of man theft. Their wicked deed would explain, too, why they had accepted so small a sum in exchange for Joseph. While discussing these points, they saw, coming their way, the travelling company of Ishmaelites that had been observed earlier by the sons of Jacob, and they determined to dispose of Joseph to them, that they might at least not lose the price they had paid, and might escape the danger at the same time of being made captives for the crime of kidnapping a man. And the Ishmaelites bought Joseph from the Midianites, and they paid the same price as his former owners had given for him.",

      "content": "As a rule the only merchandise with which the Ishmaelites loaded their camels was pitch and the skins of beasts. By a providential dispensation they carried bags of perfumery this time, instead of their usual ill-smelling freight, that sweet fragrance might be wafted to Joseph on his journey to Egypt. These aromatic substances were well suited to Joseph, whose body emitted a pleasant smell, so agreeable and pervasive that the road along which he travelled was redolent thereof, and on his arrival in Egypt the perfume from his body spread over the whole land, and the royal princesses, following the sweet scent to trace its source, reached the place in which Joseph was. Even after his death the same fragrance was spread abroad by his bones, enabling Moses to distinguish Joseph's remains from all others, and keep the oath of the children of Israel, to inter them in the Holy Land. When Joseph learned that the Ishmaelites were carrying him to Egypt, he began to weep bitterly at the thought of being removed so far from Canaan and from his father. One of the Ishmaelites noticed Joseph's weeping and crying, and thinking that he found riding uncomfortable, he lifted him from the back of the camel, and permitted him to walk on foot. But Joseph continued to weep and sob, crying incessantly, \"O father, father!\" Another one of the caravan, tired of his lamentations, beat him, causing only the more tears and wails, until the youth, exhausted by his grief, was unable to move on. Now all the Ishmaelites in the company dealt out blows to him. They treated him with relentless cruelty, and tried to silence him by threats. God saw Joseph's distress, and He sent darkness and terror upon the Ishmaelites, and their hands grew rigid when they raised them to inflict a blow. Astonished, they asked themselves why God did thus unto them upon the road. They did not know that it was for the sake of Joseph. The journey was continued until they came to Ephrath, the place of Rachel's sepulchre. Joseph hastened to his mother's grave, and throwing himself across it, he groaned and cried, saying: \"O mother, mother, that didst bear me, arise, come forth and see how thy son hath been sold into slavery, with none to take pity upon him. Arise, see thy son, and weep with me over my misfortune, and observe the heartlessness of my brethren. Awake, O mother, rouse thyself from thy sleep, rise up and prepare for the conflict with my brethren, who stripped me even of my shirt, and sold me as a slave to merchantmen, who in turn sold me to others, and without mercy they tore me away from my father. Arise, accuse my brethren before God, and see whom He will justify in the judgment, and whom He will find guilty. Arise, O mother, awake from thy sleep, see how my father is with me in his soul and in his spirit, and comfort him and ease his heavy heart.\" Joseph wept and cried upon the grave of his mother, until, weary from grief, he lay immovable as a stone. Then he heard a voice heavy with tears speak to him from the depths, saying: \"My son Joseph, my son, I heard thy complaints and thy groans, I saw thy tears, and I knew thy misery, my son. I am grieved for thy sake, and thy affliction is added to the burden of my affliction. But, my son Joseph, put thy trust in God, and wait upon Him. Fear not, for the Lord is with thee, and He will deliver thee from all evil. Go down into Egypt with thy masters, my son; fear naught, for the Lord is with thee, O my son.\" This and much more like unto it did the voice utter, and then it was silent. Joseph listened in great amazement at first, and then he broke out in renewed tears. Angered thereby, one of the Ishmaelites drove him from his mother's grave with kicks and curses. Then Joseph entreated his masters to take him back to his father, who would give them great riches as a reward. But they said, \"Why, thou art a slave! How canst thou know where thy father is? If thou hadst had a free man as father, thou wouldst not have been sold twice for a petty sum.\" And then their fury against him increased, they beat him and maltreated him, and he wept bitter tears. Now God looked upon the distress of Joseph, and He sent darkness to enshroud the land once more. A storm raged, the lightning flashed, and from the thunderbolts the whole earth trembled, and the Ishmaelites lost their way in their terror. The beasts and the camels stood still, and, beat them as their drivers would, they refused to budge from the spot, but crouched down upon the ground. Then the Ishmaelites spake to one another, and said: \"Why hath God brought this upon us? What are our sins, what our trespasses, that such things befall us?\" One of them said to the others: \"Peradventure this hath come upon us by reason of the sin which we have committed against this slave. Let us beg him earnestly to grant us forgiveness, and if then God will take pity, and let these storms pass away from us, we shall know that we suffered harm on account of the injury we inflicted upon this slave.\" The Ishmaelites did according to these words, and they said unto Joseph: \"We have sinned against God and against thee. Pray to thy God, and entreat Him to take this death plague from us, for we acknowledge that we have sinned against Him.\" Joseph fulfilled their wish, and God hearkened to his petition, and the storm was assuaged. All around became calm, the beasts arose from their recumbent position, and the caravan could proceed upon its way. Now the Ishmaelites saw plainly that all their trouble had come upon them for the sake of Joseph, and they spoke one to another, saying: \"We know now that all this evil hath happened to us on account of this poor fellow, and wherefore should we bring death upon ourselves by our own doings? Let us take counsel together, what is to be done with the slave.\" One of them advised that Joseph's wish be fulfilled, and he be taken back to his father. Then they would be sure of receiving the money they had paid out for him. This plan was rejected, because they had accomplished a great part of their journey, and they were not inclined to retrace their steps. They therefore resolved upon carrying Joseph to Egypt and selling him there. They would rid themselves of him in this way, and also receive a great price for him. They continued their journey as far as the borders of Egypt, and there they met four men, descendants of Medan, the son of Abraham, and to these they sold Joseph for five shekels. The two companies, the Ishmaelites and the Medanites, arrived in Egypt upon the same day. The latter, hearing that Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, was seeking a good slave, repaired to him at once, to try to dispose of Joseph to him. Potiphar was willing to pay as much as four hundred pieces of silver, for, high as the price was, it did not seem too great for a slave that pleased him as much as Joseph. However, he made a condition. He said to the Medanites: \"I will pay you the price demanded, but you must bring me the person that sold the slave to you, that I may be in a position to find out all about him, for the youth seems to me to be neither a slave nor the son of a slave. He appears to be of noble blood. I must convince myself that he was not stolen.\" The Medanites brought the Ishmaelites to Potiphar, and they testified that Joseph was a slave, that they had owned him, and had sold him to the Medanites. Potiphar rested satisfied with this report, paid the price asked for Joseph, and the Medanites and the Ishmaelites went their way.",

      "content": "No sooner was the sale of Joseph an accomplished fact than the sons of Jacob repented of their deed. They even hastened after the Midianites to ransom Joseph, but their efforts to overtake them were vain, and they had to accept the inevitable. Meantime Reuben had rejoined his brethren. He had been so deeply absorbed in penances, in praying and studying the Torah, in expiation of his sin against his father, that he had not been able to remain with his brethren and tend the flocks, and thus it happened that he was not on the spot when Joseph was sold. His first errand was to go to the pit, in the hope of finding Joseph there. In that case he would have carried him off and restored him to his father clandestinely, without the knowledge of his brethren. He stood at the opening and called again and again, \"Joseph, Joseph!\" As he received no answer, he concluded that Joseph had perished, either by reason of terror or as the result of a snake bite, and he descended into the pit, only to find that he was not there, either living or dead. He mounted to the top again, and rent his clothes, and cried out, \"The lad is not there, and what answer shall I give to my father, if he be dead?\" Then Reuben returned unto his brethren, and told them that Joseph bad vanished from the pit, whereat he was deeply grieved, because he, being the oldest of the sons, was responsible to their father Jacob. The brethren made a clean breast of what they had done with Joseph, and they related to him how they had tried to make good their evil deed, and how their efforts had been vain. Now there remained nothing to do but invent a plausible explanation for their brother's disappearance to give to Jacob. First of all, however, they took an oath not to betray to his father or any human being what they bad actually done with Joseph. He who violated the oath would be put to the sword by the rest. Then they took counsel together about what to say to Jacob. It was Issachar's advice to tear Joseph's coat of many colors, and dip it in the blood of a little kid of the goats, to make Jacob believe that his son had been torn by a wild beast. The reason he suggested a kid was because its blood looks like human blood. In expiation of this act of deception, it was ordained that a kid be used as an atonement sacrifice when the Tabernacle was dedicated. Simon opposed this suggestion. He did not want to relinquish Joseph's coat, and he threatened to hew down any one that should attempt to wrest it from him by force. The reason for his vehemence was that he was very much enraged against his brethren for not having slain Joseph. But they threatened him in turn, saying, \"If thou wilt not give up the coat, we shall say that thou didst execute the evil deed thyself.\" At that Simon surrendered it, and Naphtali brought it to Jacob, handing it to him with the words: \"When we were driving our herds homeward, we found this garment covered with blood and dust on the highway, a little beyond Shechem. Know now whether it be thy son's coat or not.\" Jacob recognized Joseph's coat, and, overwhelmed by grief, he fell prostrate, and long lay on the ground motionless, like a stone. Then he arose, and set up a loud cry, and wept, saying, \"It is my son's coat.\" In great haste Jacob dispatched a slave to his sons, to bid them come to him, that he might learn more about what had happened. In the evening they all came, their garments rent, and dust strewn upon their heads. When they confirmed all that Naphtali had told him, Jacob broke out in mourning and lamentation: \"It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces. I sent him to you to see whether it was well with you, and well with the flock. He went to do my errand, and while I thought him to be with you, the misfortune befell.\" Thereto the sons of Jacob made reply: \"He came to us not at all. Since we left thee, we have not set eyes on him.\" After these words, Jacob could doubt no longer that Joseph bad been torn by wild beasts, and he mourned for his son, saying: \"O my son Joseph, my son, I sent thee to inquire after the welfare of thy brethren, and now thou art torn by wild beasts. It is my fault that this evil chance hath come upon thee. I am distressed for thee, my son, I am sorely distressed. How sweet was thy life to me, and how bitter is thy death! Would God I had died for thee, O Joseph, my son, for now I am distressed on thy account. O my son Joseph, where art thou, and where is thy soul? Arise, arise from thy place, and look upon my grief for thee. Come and count the tears that roll down my cheeks, and bring the tale of them before God, that His wrath be turned away from me. O Joseph, my son, how painful and appalling was thy death! None hath died a death like thine since the world doth stand. I know well that it came to pass by reason of my sins. O that thou wouldst return and see the bitter sorrow thy misfortune hath brought upon me! But it is true, it was not I that created thee, and formed thee. I gave thee neither spirit nor soul, but God created thee. He formed thy bones, covered them with flesh, breathed the breath of life into thy nostrils, and then gave thee unto me. And God who gave thee unto me, He hath taken thee from me, and from Him hath this dispensation come upon me. What the Lord doeth is well done!\" In these words and many others like them Jacob mourned and bewailed his son, until he fell to the ground prostrate and immovable. When the sons of Jacob saw the vehemence of their father's grief, they repented of their deed, and wept bitterly. Especially Judah was grief-stricken. He laid his father's head upon his knees, and wiped his tears away as they flowed from his eyes, while he himself broke out in violent weeping. The sons of Jacob and their wives all sought to comfort their father. They arranged a great memorial service, and they wept and mourned over Joseph's death and over their father's sorrow. But Jacob refused to be comforted. The tidings of his son's death caused the loss of two members of Jacob's family. Bilhah and Dinah could not survive their grief. Bilhah passed away the very day whereon the report reached Jacob, and Dinah died soon after, and so he had three losses to mourn in one month. He received the tidings of Joseph's death in the seventh month, Tishri, and on the tenth day of the month, and therefore the children of Israel are bidden to weep and afflict their souls on this day. Furthermore, on this day the sin offering of atonement shall be a kid of the goats, because the sons of Jacob transgressed with a kid, in the blood of which they dipped Joseph's coat, and thus they brought sorrow upon Jacob. When he had recovered somewhat from the stunning blow which the tidings of his favorite son's death had dealt him, Jacob rose up from the ground and addressed his sons, tears streaming down his cheeks all the while. \"Up,\" he said, \"take your swords and your bows, go out in the field, and make search, perhaps you will find the body of my son, and you will bring it to me, so that I may bury it. Keep a lookout, too, for beasts of prey, and catch the first you meet. Seize it and bring it to me. It may be that God will have pity upon my sorrow, and put the beast between your hands that hath torn my child in pieces, and I will take my revenge upon it.\" The sons of Jacob set out on the morrow to do the bidding of their father, while he remained at home and wept and lamented for Joseph. In the wilderness they found a wolf, which they caught and brought to Jacob alive, saying: \"Here is the first wild beast we encountered, and we have brought it to thee. But of thy son's corpse we saw not a trace.\" Jacob seized the wolf, and, amid loud weeping, he addressed these words to him: \"Why didst thou devour my son Joseph, without any fear of the God of the earth, and without taking any thought of the grief thou wouldst bring down upon me? Thou didst devour my son without reason, he was guilty of no manner of transgression, and thou didst roll the responsibility for his death upon me. But God avengeth him that is persecuted.\" To grant consolation to Jacob, God opened the mouth of the beast, and he spake: \"As the Lord liveth, who hath created me, and as thy soul liveth, my lord, I have not seen thy son, and I did not rend him in pieces. From a land afar off I came to seek mine own son, who suffered a like fate with thine. He hath disappeared, and I know not whether he be dead or alive, and therefore I came hither ten days ago to find him. This day, while I was searching for him, thy sons met me, and they seized me, and, adding more grief to my grief over my lost son, they brought me hither to thee. This is my story, and now, O son of man, I am in thy hands, thou canst dispose of me this day as seemeth well in thy sight, but I swear unto thee by the God that bath created me, I have not seen thy son, nor have I torn him in pieces, never hath the flesh of man come into my mouth.\" Astonished at the speech of the wolf, Jacob let him go, unhindered, whithersoever he would, but he mourned his son Joseph as before. It is a law of nature that however much one may grieve over the death of a dear one, at the end of a year consolation finds its way to the heart of the mourner. But the disappearance of a living man can never be wiped out of one's memory. Therefore the fact that he was inconsolable made Jacob suspect that Joseph was alive, and he did not give entire credence to the report of his sons. His vague suspicion was strengthened by something that happened to him. He went up into the mountains, hewed twelve stones out of the quarry, and wrote the names of his sons thereon, their constellations, and the months corresponding to the constellations, a stone for a son, thus, \"Reuben, Ram, Nisan,\" and so for each of his twelve sons. Then he addressed the stones and bade them bow down before the one marked with Reuben's name, constellation, and month, and they did not move. He gave the same order regarding the stone marked for Simon, and again the stones stood still. And so he did respecting all his sons, until he reached the stone for Joseph. When he spoke concerning this one, \"I command you to fall down before Joseph,\" they all prostrated themselves. He tried the same test with other things, with trees and sheaves, and always the result was the same, and Jacob could not but feel that his suspicion was true, Joseph was alive. There was a reason why God did not reveal the real fate of Joseph to Jacob. When his brethren sold Joseph, their fear that the report of their iniquity might reach the ears of Jacob led them to pronounce the ban upon any that should betray the truth without the consent of all the others. Judah advanced the objection that a ban is invalid unless it is decreed in the presence of ten persons, and there were but nine of them, for Reuben and Benjamin were not there when the sale of Joseph was concluded. To evade the difficulty, the brothers counted God as the tenth person, and therefore God felt bound to refrain from revealing the true state of things to Jacob. He had regard, as it were, for the ban pronounced by the brethren of Joseph. And as God kept the truth a secret from Jacob, Isaac did not feel justified in acquainting him with his grandson's fate, which was well known to him, for he was a prophet. Whenever he was in the company of Jacob, he mourned with him, but as soon as he quitted him, he left off from manifesting grief, because he knew that Joseph lived. Jacob was thus the only one among Joseph's closest kinsmen that remained in ignorance of his son's real fortunes, and he was the one of them all that had the greatest reason for regretting his death. He spoke: \"The covenant that God made with me regarding the twelve tribes is null and void now. I did strive in vain to establish the twelve tribes, seeing that now the death of Joseph hath destroyed the covenant. All the works of God were made to correspond to the number of the tribes—twelve are the signs of the zodiac, twelve the months, twelve hours hath the day, twelve the night, and twelve stones are set in Aaron's breastplate—and now that Joseph hath departed, the covenant of the tribes is set at naught.\" He could not replace the lost son by entering into a new marriage, for he had made the promise to his father-in-law to take none beside his daughters to wife, and this promise, as he interpreted it, held good after the death of Laban's daughters as well as while they were alive. Beside grief over his loss and regret at the breaking of the covenant of the tribes, Jacob had still another reason for mourning the death of Joseph. God had said to Jacob, \"If none of thy sons dies during thy lifetime, thou mayest look upon it as a token that thou wilt not be put in Gehenna after thy death.\" Thinking Joseph to be dead, Jacob had his own fate to bewail, too, for he now believed that he was doomed to Gehenna. His mourning lasted all of twenty-two years, corresponding to the number of the years he had dwelt apart from his parents, and had not fulfilled the duty of a son toward them. In his mourning Jacob put sackcloth upon his loins, and therein be became a model for the kings and princes in Israel, for David, Ahab, Joram, and Mordecai did likewise when a great misfortune befell the nation.",

      "content": "When the sons of Jacob saw how inconsolable their father was, they went to Judah, and said to him, \"This great misfortune is thy fault.\" Judah replied: \"It was I that asked you, What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood? and now you say the sin lies at my door.\" The brethren continued to argue: \"But it was thou that didst say, Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and we followed thy advice. Hadst thou said, Let us restore him to his father, we had heeded these words of thine as well.\" The brethren hereupon deprived Judah of his dignity, for hitherto he had been their king, and they also excluded him from their fellowship, and he had to seek his fortune alone. Through the mediation of his chief shepherd Hirah, he became acquainted with the Canaanitish king of Adullam, Barsan by name. Though he was well aware of the corruption of the generations of Canaan, he permitted passion to get the better of him, and took a Canaanite to wife. The Adullamite king gave a banquet in his honor, at which his daughter Bath-shua poured the wine, and intoxicated by wine and passion Judah took her and married her. Judah's action may be compared to that of the lion who passes a carrion and eats of it, though a cur preceding him on the way had refused to touch it. Even Esau came in time to acknowledge that the daughters of Canaan were wicked, and the lion Judah must needs take one of them to wife. The holy spirit cried out against Judah when he married the Canaanite woman of Adullam, saying, \"The glory of Israel went down in Adullam.\" The first-born son of Judah from this marriage was named Er, \"the childless,\" a suitable name for him that died without begetting any issue. At Judah's desire, Er married Tamar, a daughter of Aram, the son of Shem, but because she was not a Canaanitish woman, his mother used artifices against her, and he did not know her, and an angel of the Lord killed him on the third day after his wedding. Then Judah gave Tamar to his second son Onan, the marriage taking place before the week of the wedding festivities for Er had elapsed. A whole year Onan lived with Tamar without knowing her, and when, finally, Judah uttered threats against him on that account, he did, indeed, have intercourse with her, but, giving heed to the injunctions of his mother, he took care not to beget any children with her. He, too, died on account of his iniquity, and his name Onan \"mourning,\" was well chosen, for very soon was his father called upon to mourn for him. Now Judah conceived the plan of marrying Tamar to his youngest son Shelah, but his wife would not permit it. She hated Tamar because she was not of the daughters of Canaan like herself, and while Judah was away from home, Bath-shua chose a wife for her son Shelah from the daughters of Canaan. Judah was very angry at Bath-shua for what she had done, and also God poured out His wrath upon her, for on account of her wickedness she had to die, and her death happened a year after that of her two sons. Now that Bath-shua was dead, Judah might have carried out his wish and married Tamar to his youngest son. But he waited for Shelah to grow up, because he feared for his life, seeing that Tamar had brought death to two husbands before him. So she remained a widow in her father's house for two years. Endowed with the gift of prophecy, Tamar knew that she was appointed to be the ancestress of David and of the Messiah, and she determined to venture upon an extreme measure in order to make sure of fulfilling her destiny. Accordingly, when the holy spirit revealed to her that Judah was going up to Timnah, she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and sat in the gate of Abraham's tent, and there she encountered Judah. All the time she lived in the house of her father-in-law, he had never seen her face, for in her virtue and chastity she had always kept it covered, and now when Judah met her, he did not recognize her. It was as a reward for her modesty that God made her to become the mother of the royal line of David, and the ancestress of Isaiah, and his father Amoz as well, both of whom were prophets and of royal blood. Judah passed Tamar by without paying any attention to her, and she raised her eyes heavenward, and said, \"O Lord of the world, shall I go forth empty from the house of this pious man?\" Then God sent the angel that is appointed over the passion of love, and he compelled Judah to turn back. With prophetic caution, Tamar demanded that, as a pledge for the reward he promised her, he leave with her his signet, his mantle, and his staff, the symbols of royalty, judgeship, and Messiahship, the three distinctions of the descendants of Tamar from her union with Judah. When Judah sent her the promised reward, a kid of the goats, by the hand of his friend, in order to receive the pledges from her hand, Tamar could not be found, and he feared to make further search for her, lest he be put to shame. But Tamar, who soon discerned that she was with child, felt very happy and proud, for she knew that she would be the mother of kings and redeemers. When her state became known, she was forcibly dragged before the court, in which Isaac, Jacob, and Judah sat as judges. Judah, being the youngest of the judges and the least considerable in dignity, was the first to give a decision, for thus it is prescribed in criminal cases, that the prominent judges overawe not the lesser and influence their decisions unduly. It was the opinion of Judah that the woman was liable to the penalty of death by burning, for she was the daughter of the high priest Shem, and death by fire is the punishment ordained by the law for a high priest's daughter that leads an unchaste life. The preparations for her execution were begun. In vain Tamar searched for the three pledges she had received from Judah, she could not find them, and almost she lost hope that she would be able to wring a confession from her father-in-law. She raised her eyes to God, and prayed: \"I supplicate Thy grace, O God, Thou who givest ear to the cry of the distressed in the hour of his need, answer me, that I may be spared to bring forth the three holy children, who will be ready to suffer death by fire, for the sake of the glory of Thy Name.\" And God granted her petition, and sent the angel Michael down to succor her. He put the pledges in a place in which Tamar could not fail to see them, and she took them, and threw them before the feet of the judges, with the words: \"By the man whose these are am I with child, but though I perish in the flames, I will not betray him. I hope in the Lord of the world, that He will turn the heart of the man, so that he will make confession thereof.\" Then Judah rose up, and said: \"With your permission, my brethren, and ye men of my father's house, I make it known that with what measure a man metes, it shall be measured unto him, be it for good or for evil, but happy the man that acknowledgeth his sins. Because I took the coat of Joseph, and colored it with the blood of a kid, and then laid it at the feet of my father, saying, Know now whether it be thy son's coat or not, therefore must I now confess, before the court, unto whom belongeth this signet, this mantle, and this staff. But it is better that I be put to shame in this world than I should be put to shame in the other world, before the face of my pious father. It is better that I should perish in a fire that can be extinguished than I should be cast into hell fire, which devoureth other fires. Now, then, I acknowledge that Tamar is innocent. By me is she with child, not because she indulged in illicit passion, but because I held back her marriage with my son Shelah.\" Then a heavenly voice was heard to say: \"Ye are both innocent! It was the will of God that it should happen!\" The open confession of Judah induced his oldest brother Reuben to make public acknowledgment of the sin he had committed against his father, for he had kept it a secret until then. Tamar gave birth to twin sons, Perez and Zerah, both resembling their father in bravery and piety. She called the first Perez, \"mighty,\" because she said, \"Thou didst show thyself of great power, and it is meet and proper that thou shouldst be strong, for thou art destined to possess the kingdom.\" The second son was called Zerah, because he appeared from out of the womb before his brother, but he was forced back again to make way for Perez. These two, Perez and Zerah. were sent out as spies by Joshua, and the line that Rahab bound in the window of her house as a token to the army of the Israelites, she received from Zerah. It was the scarlet thread that the midwife had bound upon his hand, to mark him as the child that appeared first and withdrew.",

      "title": "The Wives Of The Sons Of Jacob",
      "content": "Judah was the first of the sons of Jacob to enter wedlock. After the sale of Joseph to the Midianites, his brethren had said to Judah, \"If conditions were as before, our father would provide wives for us now. As it is, he is entirely absorbed by his grief for Joseph, and we must look about for wives ourselves. Thou art our chief, and thou shouldst marry first.\" Judah's marriage with Alit the daughter of the noble merchant Shua, which was consummated at Adullam, the residence of his friend Hirah, or, as he was called later, Hiram, king of Tyre, was not happy. His two oldest sons died, and shortly thereafter his wife also. It was Judah's punishment for having begun a good deed and left it unfinished, for \"he who begins a good deed, and does not execute it to the end, brings down misfortune upon his own head.\" Judah had rescued Joseph from death, but it was his suggestion to sell him into slavery. Had he urged them to restore the lad to his father, his brethren would have obeyed his words. He was lacking in constancy to persist until he had completed the work of Joseph's deliverance, which he had begun. In the same year, the year of Joseph's misfortune, all his other brethren married, too. Reuben's wife was named Elyoram, the daughter of the Canaanite Uzzi of Timnah. Simon married his sister Dinah first, and then a second wife. When Simon and Levi massacred the men of Shechem, Dinah refused to leave the city and follow her brethren, saying, \"Whither shall I carry my shame?\" But Simon swore he would marry her, as he did later, and when she died in Egypt, he took her body to the Holy Land and buried it there. Dinah bore her brother a son, and from her union with Shechem, the son of Hamor, sprang a daughter, Asenath by name, afterward the wife of Joseph. When this daughter was born to Dinah, her brethren, the sons of Jacob, wanted to kill her, that the finger of men might not point at the fruit of sin in their father's house. But Jacob took a piece of tin, inscribed the Holy Name upon it, and bound it about the neck of the girl, and he put her under a thornbush, and abandoned her there. An angel carried the babe down to Egypt, where Potiphar adopted her as his child, for his wife was barren. Years thereafter, when Joseph travelled through the land as viceroy, the maidens threw gifts at him, to make him turn his eyes in their direction and give them the opportunity of gazing upon his beauty. Asenath possessed nothing that would do as a present, therefore she took off the amulet suspended from her neck, and gave it to him. Thus Joseph became acquainted with her lineage, and he married her, seeing that she was not an Egyptian, but one connected with the house of Jacob through her mother. Beside the son of Dinah, Simon had another son, whose name was Saul, by Bunah, the damsel he had taken captive in the campaign against Shechem. Levi and Issachar married two daughters of Jobab, the grandson of Eber; the wife of the former was named Adinah, the wife of the latter, Aridah. Dan's wife was Elflalet, a daughter of the Moabite Hamudan. For a long time their marriage remained childless, finally they had a son, whom they called Hushim. Gad and Naphtali married women from Haran, two sisters, daughters of Amoram, a grandson of Nahor. Naphtali's wife, Merimit, was the older of the two, and the younger, the wife of Gad, was named Uzit. Asher's first wife was Adon, the daughter of Ephlal, a grandson of Ishmael. She died childless, and he married a second wife, Hadorah, a daughter of Abimael, the grandson of Shem. She had been married before, her first husband having been Malchiel, also a grandson of Shem, and the issue of this first marriage was a daughter, Serah by name. When Asher brought his wife to Canaan, the three year old orphan Serah came with them. She was raised in the house of Jacob, and she walked in the way of pious children, and God gave her beauty, wisdom, and sagacity. Zebulon's wife was Maroshah, the daughter of Molad, a grandson of Midian, the son of Abraham by Keturah. For Benjamin, when he was but ten years old, Jacob took Mahlia to wife, the daughter of Aram, the grandson of Terah, and she bore him five sons. At the age of eighteen he married a second wife, Arbat, the daughter of Zimran, a son of Abraham by Keturah, and by her also he had five sons.",

      "content": "When Joseph was sold as a slave to the Ishmaelites, he kept silent out of respect for his brethren, and did not tell his masters that he was a son of Jacob, a great and powerful man. Even when he came to the Midianites with the Ishmaelites, and the former asked after his parentage, he still said he was a slave, only in order not to put his brethren to shame. But the most distinguished of the Midianites rebuked Joseph, saying, \"Thou art no slave, thy appearance betrayeth thee,\" and he threatened him with death unless he acknowledged the truth. Joseph, however, was steadfast, he would not act treacherously toward his brethren. Arrived in Egypt, the owners of Joseph could come to no agreement regarding him. Each desired to have sole and exclusive possession of him. They therefore decided to leave him with a shopkeeper until they should come back to Egypt again with their merchandise. And God let Joseph find grace in the sight of the shopkeeper. All that he had, his whole house, he put into Joseph's hand, and therefore the Lord blessed him with much silver and gold, and Joseph remained with him for three months and five days. At that time there came from Memphis the wife of Potiphar, and she cast her eyes upon Joseph, of whose comeliness of person she had heard from the eunuchs. She told her husband how that a certain shopkeeper had grown rich through a young Hebrew, and she added: \"But it is said that the youth was stolen away out of the land of Canaan. Go, therefore, and sit in judgment upon his owner, and take the youth unto thy house, that the God of the Hebrews may bless thee, for the grace of heaven rests upon the youth.\" Potiphar summoned the shopkeeper, and when he appeared before him, he spoke harshly to him, saying: \"What is this I hear? that thou stealest souls from the land of Canaan, and dost carry on traffic with them?\" The shop-keeper protested his innocence, and he could not be made to recede from his assertion, that a company of Ishmaelites had left Joseph in his charge temporarily, until they should return. Potiphar had him stripped naked and beaten, but he continued to reiterate the same statement. Then Potiphar summoned Joseph. The youth prostrated himself before this chief of the eunuchs, for he was third in rank of the officers of Pharaoh. And he addressed Joseph, and said, \"Art thou a slave or a free-born man?\" and Joseph replied, \"A slave.\" Potiphar continued to question him, \"Whose slave art thou?\" Joseph: \"I belong to the Ishmaelites.\" Potiphar: \"How wast thou made a slave?\" Joseph: \"They bought me in the land of Canaan.\" But Potiphar refused to give credence to what he said, and he had also him stripped and beaten. The wife of Potiphar, standing by the door, saw how Joseph was abused, and she sent word to her husband, \"Thy verdict is unjust, for thou punishest the free-born youth that was stolen away from his place as though he were the one that had committed a crime.\" As Joseph held firmly to what he had said, Potiphar ordered him to prison, until his masters should return. In her sinful longing for him, his wife wanted to have Joseph in her own house, and she remonstrated with her husband in these words: \"Wherefore dost thou keep the captive, nobly-born slave a prisoner? Thou shouldst rather set him at liberty and have him serve thee.\" He answered, \"The law of the Egyptians does not permit us to take what belongs to another before all titles are made clear,\" and Joseph stayed in prison for twenty-four days, until the return of the Ishmaelites to Egypt. Meanwhile they had heard somewhere that Joseph was the son of Jacob, and they therefore said to him: \"Why didst thou pretend that thou wast a slave? See, we have information that thou art the son of a powerful man in Canaan, and thy father mourns for thee in sackcloth.\" Joseph was on the point of divulging his secret, but he kept a check upon himself for the sake of his brethren, and he repeated that he was a slave. Nevertheless the Ishmaelites decided to sell him, that he be not found in their hands, for they feared the revenge of Jacob, who, they knew, was in high favor with the Lord and with men. The shopkeeper begged the Ishmaelites to rescue him from the legal prosecution of Potiphar, and clear him of the suspicion of man theft. The Ishmaelites in turn had a conference with Joseph, and bade him testify before Potiphar that they had bought him for money. He did so, and then the chief of the eunuchs liberated him from prison, and dismissed all parties concerned. With the permission of her husband, Potiphar's wife sent a eunuch to the Ishmaelites, bidding him to buy Joseph, but he returned and reported that they demanded an exorbitant price for the slave. She dispatched a second eunuch, charging him to conclude the bargain, and though they asked one mina of gold, or even two, he was not to be sparing of money, he was to be sure to buy the slave and bring him to her. The eunuch gave the Ishmaelites eighty pieces of gold for Joseph, telling his mistress, however, that he had paid out a hundred pieces. Joseph noticed the deception, but he kept silent, that the eunuch might not be put to shame. Thus Joseph became the slave of the idolatrous priest Potiphar, or Poti-phera, as he was sometimes called. He had secured possession of the handsome youth for a lewd purpose, but the angel Gabriel mutilated him in such manner that he could not accomplish it. His master soon had occasion to notice that Joseph was as pious as he was beautiful, for whenever he was occupied with his ministrations, he would whisper a prayer: \"O Lord of the world, Thou art my trust, Thou art my protection. Let me find grace and favor in Thy sight and in the sight of all that see me, and in the sight of my master Potiphar.\" When Potiphar noticed the movement of his lips, he said to Joseph, \"Dost thou purpose to cast a spell upon me?\" \"Nay,\" replied the youth, \"I am beseeching God to let me find favor in thine eyes.\" His prayer was heard. Potiphar convinced himself that God was with Joseph. Sometimes he would make a test of Joseph's miraculous powers. If he brought him a glass of hippocras, he would say, \"I would rather have wine mixed with absinthe,\" and straightway the spiced wine was changed into bitter wine. Whatever he desired, he could be sure to get from Joseph, and he saw clearly that God fulfilled the wishes of his slave. Therefore he put all the keys of his house into his hand, and he knew not aught that was with him, keeping back nothing from Joseph but his wife. Seeing that the Shekinah rested upon him, Potiphar treated Joseph not as a slave, but as a member of his family, for he said, \"This youth is not cut out for a slave's work, he is worthy of a prince's place.\" Accordingly, he provided instruction for him in the arts, and ordered him to have better fare than the other slaves. Joseph thanked God for his new and happy state. He prayed, \"Blessed art Thou, O Lord, that Thou hast caused me to forget my father's house.\" What made his present fortunes so agreeable was that he was removed from the envy and jealousy of his brethren. He said: \"When I was in my father's house, and he gave me something pretty, my brethren begrudged me the present, and now, O Lord, I thank Thee that I live amid plenty.\" Free from anxieties, he turned his attention to his external appearance. He painted his eyes, dressed his hair, and aimed to be elegant in his walk. But God spake to him, saying, \"Thy father is mourning in sackcloth and ashes, while thou dost eat, drink, and dress thy hair. Therefore I will stir up thy mistress against thee, and thou shalt be embarrassed.\" Thus Joseph's secret wish was fulfilled, that he might be permitted to prove his piety under temptation, as the piety of his fathers had been tested.",

      "content": "\"Throw the stick up in the air, it will always return to its original place.\" Like Rachel his mother, Joseph was of ravishing beauty, and the wife of his master was filled with invincible passion for him.\" Her feeling was heightened by the astrologic forecast that she was destined to have descendants through Joseph. This was true, but not in the sense in which she understood the prophecy. Joseph married her daughter Asenath later on, and she bore him children, thus fulfilling what had been read in the stars.\" In the beginning she did not confess her love to Joseph. She tried first to seduce him by artifice. On the pretext of visiting him, she would go to him at night, and, as she had no sons, she would pretend a desire to adopt him. Joseph then prayed to God in her behalf, and she bore a son. However, she continued to embrace him as though he were her own child, yet he did not notice her evil designs. Finally, when he recognized her wanton trickery, he mourned many days, and endeavored to turn her away from her sinful passion by the word of God. She, on her side, often threatened him with death, and surrendered him to castigations in order to make him amenable to her will, and when these means had no effect upon Joseph, she sought to seduce him with enticements. She would say, \"I promise thee, thou shalt rule over me and all I have, if thou wilt but give thyself up to me. and thou shalt be to me the same as my lawful husband.\" But Joseph was mindful of the words of his fathers, and he went into his chamber, and fasted, and prayed to God, that He would deliver him from the toils of the Egyptian woman. In spite of the mortifications he practiced, and though he gave the poor and the sick the food apportioned to him, his master thought he lived a luxurious life, for those that fast for the glory of God are made beautiful of countenance. The wife of Potiphar would frequently speak to her husband in praise of Joseph's chastity in order that he might conceive no suspicion of the state of her feelings. And, again, she would encourage Joseph secretly, telling him not to fear her husband, that he was convinced of his purity of life, and though one should carry tales to him about Joseph and herself, Potiphar would lend them no credence. And when she saw that all this was ineffectual , she approached him with the request that he teach her the word of God, saying, \"If it be thy wish that I forsake idol worship, then fulfil my desire, and I will persuade that Egyptian husband of mine to abjure the idols, and we shall walk in the law of thy God.\" Joseph replied, \"The Lord desireth not that those who fear Him shall walk in impurity, nor hath He pleasure in the adulterer.\" Another time she came to him, and said, \"If thou wilt not do my desire, I will murder the Egyptian and wed with thee according to the law.\" Whereat Joseph rent his garment, and he said, \"O woman, fear the Lord, and do not execute this evil deed, that thou mayest not bring destruction down upon thyself, for I will proclaim thy impious purposes to all in public.\" Again, she sent him a dish prepared with magic spells, by means of which she hoped to get him into her power. But when the eunuch set it before him, he saw the image of a man handing him a sword together with the dish, and, warned by the vision, he took good care not to taste of the food. A few days later his mistress came to him, and asked him why he had not eaten of what she had sent him. He reproached her, saying, \"How couldst thou tell me, I do not come nigh unto the idols, but only unto the Lord? The God of my fathers hath revealed thy iniquity to me through an angel, but that thou mayest know that the malice of the wicked has no power over those who fear God in purity, I shall eat thy food before thine eyes, and the God of my fathers and the angel of Abraham will be with me.\" The wife of Potiphar fell upon her face at the feet of Joseph, and amid tears she promised not to commit this sin again. But her unholy passion for Joseph did not depart from her, and her distress over her unfulfilled wish made her look so ill that her husband said to her, \"Why is thy countenance fallen?\" And she replied, \"I have a pain at my heart, and the groanings of my spirit oppress me.\" Once when she was alone with Joseph, she rushed toward him, crying, \"I will throttle myself, or I will jump into a well or a pit, if thou wilt not yield thyself to me.\" Noticing her extreme agitation, Joseph endeavored to calm her with these words, \"Remember, if thou makest away with thyself, thy husband's concubine, Asteho, thy rival, will maltreat thy children, and extirpate thy memory from the earth.\" These words, gently spoken, had the opposite effect from that intended. They only inflamed her passion the more by feeding her hopes. She said: \"There, seest thou, thou dost love me now! It sufficeth for me that thou takest thought for me and for the safety of my children. I expect now that my desire will be fulfilled.\" She did not know that Joseph spoke as he did for the sake of God, and not for her sake. His mistress, or, as she was called, Zuleika, pursued him day after day with her amorous talk and her flattery, saying: \"How fair is thy appearance, how comely thy form! Never have I seen so well-favored a slave as thou art.\" Joseph would reply: \"God, who formed me in my mother's womb, hath created all men.\" Zuleika: \"How beautiful are thine eyes, with which thou hast charmed all Egyptians, both men and women!\" Joseph: \"Beautiful as they may be while I am alive, so ghastly they will be to look upon in the grave.\" Zuleika: \"How lovely and pleasant are thy words! I pray thee, take thy harp, play and also sing, that I may hear thy words.\" Joseph: \"Lovely and pleasant are my words when I proclaim the praise of my God.\" Zuleika: \"How beautiful is thy hair! Take my golden comb, and comb it.\" Joseph: \"How long wilt thou continue to speak thus to me? Leave off! It were better for thee to care for thy household.\" Zuleika: \"There is nothing in my house that I care for, save thee alone.\" But Joseph's virtue was unshaken. While she spoke thus, he did not so much as raise his eyes to look at his mistress. He remained equally steadfast when she lavished gifts upon him, for she provided him with garments of one kind for the morning, another for noon, and a third kind for the evening. Nor could threats move him. She would say, \"I will bring false accusations against thee before thy master,\" and Joseph would reply, \"The Lord executeth judgment for the oppressed.\" Or, \"I will deprive thee of food;\" whereupon Joseph, \"The Lord giveth food to the hungry.\" Or, \"I will have thee thrown into prison;\" whereupon Joseph, \"The Lord looseth the prisoners.\" Or, \"I will put heavy labor upon thee that will bend thee double;\" whereupon Joseph, \"The Lord raiseth up them that are bowed down.\" Or, \"I will blind thine eyes;\" whereupon Joseph, \"The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind.\" When she began to exercise her blandishments upon him, he rejected them with the words, \"I fear my master.\" But Zuleika would say, \"I will kill him.\" Joseph replied with indignation, \"Not enough that thou wouldst make an adulterer of me, thou wouldst have me be a murderer, besides?\" And he spoke furthermore, saying, \"I fear the Lord my God!\" Zuleika: \"Nonsense! He is not here to see thee! Joseph: \"Great is the Lord and highly to be praised, and His greatness is unsearchable.\" Thereupon she took Joseph into her chamber, where an idol hung above the bed. This she covered, that it might not be a witness of what she was about to do. Joseph said: \"Though thou coverest up the eyes of the idol, remember, the eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the whole earth. Yes,\" continued Joseph, \"I have many reasons not to do this thing for the sake of God. Adam was banished from Paradise on account of violating a light command; how much more should I have to fear the punishment of God, were I to commit so grave a sin as adultery! The Lord is in the habit of choosing a favorite member of our family as a sacrifice unto Himself. Perhaps He desireth to make choice of me, but if I do thy will, I make myself unfit to be a sacrifice unto God. Also the Lord is in the habit of appearing suddenly, in visions of the night, unto those that love Him. Thus did He appear unto Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I fear that He may appear unto me at the very moment while I am defiling myself with thee. And as I fear God, so I fear my father, who withdrew the birthright from his first-born son Reuben, on account of an immoral act, and gave it to me. Were I to fulfil thy desire, I would share the fate of my brother Reuben.\" With such words, Joseph endeavored to cure the wife of his master of the wanton passion she had conceived for him, while he took heed to keep far from a heinous sin, not from fear of the punishment that would follow, nor out of consideration for the opinion of men, but because he desired to sanctify the Name of God, blessed be He, before the whole world. It was this feeling of his that Zuleika could not comprehend, and when, finally, carried away by passion, she told him in unmistakable language what she desired, and he recoiled from her, she said to Joseph: \"Why dost thou refuse to fulfil my wish? Am I not a married woman? None will find out what thou hast done.\" Joseph replied: \"If the unmarried women of the heathen are prohibited unto us, how much more their married women? As the Lord liveth, I will not commit the crime thou biddest me do.\" In this Joseph followed the example of many pious men, who utter an oath at the moment when they are in danger of succumbing to temptation, and seek thus to gather moral courage to control their evil instincts.\" When Zuleika could not prevail upon him, to persuade him, her desire threw her into a grievous sickness, and all the women of Egypt came to visit her, and they said unto her, \"Why art thou so languid and wasted, thou that lackest nothing? Is not thy husband a prince great and esteemed in the sight of the king? Is it possible that thou canst want aught of what thy heart desireth?\" Zuleika answered them, saying, \"This day shall it be made known unto you whence cometh the state wherein you see me.\" She commanded her maid-servants to prepare food for all the women, and she spread a banquet before them in her house. She placed knives upon the table to peel the oranges, and then ordered Joseph to appear, arrayed in costly garments, and wait upon her guests. When Joseph came in, the women could not take their eyes off him, and they all cut their hands with the knives, and the oranges in their hands were covered with blood, but they, not knowing what they were doing, continued to look upon the beauty of Joseph without turning their eyes away from him. Then Zuleika said unto them: \"What have ye done? Behold, I set oranges before you to eat, and you have cut your hands.\" All the women looked at their hands, and, lo, they were full of blood, and it flowed down and stained their garments. They said to Zuleika, \"This slave in thy house did enchant us, and we could not turn our eyes away from him on account of his beauty.\" She then said: \"This happened to you that looked upon him but a moment, and you could not refrain yourselves! How, then, can I control myself in whose house he abideth continually, who see him go in and out day after day? How, then, should I not waste away, or keep from languishing on account of him!\" And the women spake, saying: \"It is true, who can look upon this beauty in the house, and refrain her feelings? But he is thy slave! Why dost thou not disclose to him that which is in thy heart, rather than suffer thy life to perish through this thing?\" Zuleika answered them: \"Daily do I endeavor to persuade him, but he will not consent to my wishes. I promised him everything that is fair, yet have I met with no return from him, and therefore I am sick, as you may see.\" Her sickness increased upon her. Her husband and her household suspected not the cause of her decline, but all the women that were her friends knew that it was on account of the love she bore Joseph, and they advised her all the time to try to entice the youth. On a certain day, while Joseph was doing his master's work in the house, Zuleika came and fell suddenly upon him, but Joseph was stronger than she, and he pressed her down to the ground. Zuleika wept, and in a voice of supplication, and in bitterness of soul, she said to Joseph: \"Hast thou ever known, seen, or heard of a woman my peer in beauty, let alone a woman with beauty exceeding mine? Yet I try daily to persuade thee, I fall into decline through love of thee, I confer all this honor upon thee, and thou wilt not hearken unto my voice! Is it by reason of fear of thy master, that he punish thee? As the king liveth, no harm shall come upon thee from thy master on account of this thing. Now, therefore, I pray thee, listen to me, and consent unto my desire for the sake of the honor that I have conferred upon thee, and take this death away from me. For why should I die on account of thee?\" Joseph remained as steadfast under these importunities as before. Zuleika, however, was not discouraged; she continued her solicitations unremittingly, day after day, month after month, for a whole year, but always without the least success, for Joseph in his chastity did not permit himself even to look upon her, wherefore she resorted to constraint. She had an iron shackle placed upon his chin, and he was compelled to keep his head up and look her in the face.\"",

      "content": "Seeing that she could not attain her object by entreaties or tears, Zuleika finally used force, when she judged that the favorable chance had come. She did not have long to wait. When the Nile overflowed its banks, and, according to the annual custom of the Egyptians, all repaired to the river, men and women, people and princes, accompanied by music, Zuleika remained at home under pretense of being sick. This was her long-looked-for opportunity, she thought. She rose up and ascended to the hall of state, and arrayed herself in princely garments. She placed precious stones upon her head, onyx stones set in silver and gold, she beautified her face and her body with all sorts of things for the purifying of women, she perfumed the hall and the whole house with cassia and frankincense, spread myrrh and aloes all over, and afterward sat herself down at the entrance to the hall, in the vestibule leading to the house, through which Joseph had to pass to his work. And, behold, Joseph came from the field, and he was on the point of entering the house to do his master's work, but when he reached the place where Zuleika sat, and saw all she had done, he turned back. His mistress, perceiving it, called out to him, \"What aileth thee, Joseph? Go to thy work, I will make room for thee, that thou mayest pass by to thy seat.\" Joseph did as she bade him, he entered the house, took his seat, and set about his master's work as usual. Then Zuleika stood before him suddenly in all her beauty of person and magnificence of raiment, and repeated the desire of her heart. It was the first and the last time that Joseph's steadfastness deserted him, but only for an instant. When he was on the point of complying with the wish of his mistress, the image of his mother Rachel appeared before him, and that of his aunt Leah, and the image of his father Jacob. The last addressed him thus: \"In time to come the names of thy brethren will be graven upon the breastplate of the high priest. Dost thou desire to have thy name appear with theirs? Or wilt thou forfeit this honor through sinful conduct? For know, he that keepeth company with harlots wasteth his substance.\" This vision of the dead, and especially the image of his father, brought Joseph to his senses, and his illicit passion departed from him. Astonished at the swift change in his countenance, Zuleika said, \"My friend and true-love, why art thou so affrighted that thou art near to swooning? Joseph: \"I see my father!\" Zuleika: \"Where is he? Why, there is none in the house.\" Joseph: \"Thou belongest to a people that is like unto the ass, it perceiveth nothing. But I belong to those who can see things.\" Joseph fled forth, away from the house of his mistress, the same house in which aforetime wonders had been done for Sarah kept a captive there by Pharaoh. But hardly was he outside when the sinful passion again overwhelmed him, and he returned to Zuleika's chamber. Then the Lord appeared unto him, holding the Eben Shetiyah in His hand, and said to him: \"If thou touchest her, I will cast away this stone upon which the earth is founded, and the world will fall to ruin.\" Sobered again, Joseph started to escape from his mistress, but Zuleika caught him by his garment, and she said: \"As the king liveth, if thou wilt not fulfil my wish, thou must die,\" and while she spoke thus, she drew a sword with her free hand from under her dress, and, pressing it against Joseph's throat, she said, \"Do as I bid thee, or thou diest.\" Joseph ran out, leaving a piece of his garment in the hands of Zuleika as he wrenched himself loose from the grasp of the woman with a quick, energetic motion. Zuleika's passion for Joseph was so violent that, in lieu of its owner, whom she could not succeed in subduing to her will, she kissed and caressed the fragment of cloth left in her hand. At the same time she was not slow to perceive the danger into which she had put herself, for, she feared, Joseph might possibly betray her conduct, and she considered ways and means of obviating the consequences of her folly. Meanwhile her friends returned from the Nile festival, and they came to visit her and inquire after her health. They found her looking wretchedly ill, on account of the excitement she had passed through and the anxiety she was in. She confessed to the women what had happened with Joseph, and they advised her to accuse him of immorality before her husband, and then he would be thrown into prison. Zuleika accepted their advice, and she begged her visitors to support her charges by also lodging complaints against Joseph, that he had been annoying them with improper proposals. But Zuleika did not depend entirely upon the assistance of her friends. She planned a ruse, besides, to be sure of convincing her husband of Joseph's guilt. She laid aside her rich robes of state, put on her ordinary clothes, and took to her sick-bed, in which she had been lying when the people left to go to the festival. Also she took Joseph's torn garment, and laid it out next to her. Then she sent a little boy to summon some of the men of her house, and to them she told the tale of Joseph's alleged outrage, saying: \"See the Hebrew slave, whom your master hath brought in unto my house, and who attempted to do violence to me to-day! You had scarcely gone away to the festival when be entered the house, and making sure that no one was here he tried to force me to yield to his lustful desire. But I grasped his clothes, tore them, and cried with a loud voice. When he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he was seized with fear, and be fled, and got him out, but he left his garment by me.\" The men of her house spake not a word, but, in a rage against Joseph, they went to their master, and reported to him what had come to pass. In the meantime the husbands of Zuleika's friends had also spoken to Potiphar, at the instigation of their wives, and complained of his slave, that he molested them. Potiphar hastened home, and he found his wife in low spirits, and though the cause of her dejection was chagrin at not having succeeded in winning Joseph's love, she pretended that it was anger at the immoral conduct of the slave. She accused him in the following words: \"O husband, mayest thou not live a day longer, if thou dost not punish the wicked slave that hath desired to defile thy bed, that hath not kept in mind who he was when he came to our house, to demean himself with modesty, nor hath he been mindful of the favors he hath received from thy bounty. He did lay a privy design to abuse thy wife, and this at the time of observing a festival, when thou wouldst be absent.\" These words she spoke at the moment of conjugal intimacy with Potiphar, when she was certain of exerting an influence upon her husband. Potiphar gave credence to her words, and he had Joseph flogged unmercifully. While the cruel blows fell upon him, he cried to God, \"O Lord, Thou knowest that I am innocent of these things, and why should I die to-day on account of a false accusation by the hands of these uncircumcised, impious men?\" God opened the mouth of Zuleika's child, a babe of but eleven months, and he spoke to the men that were beating Joseph, saying: \"What is your quarrel with this man? Why do you inflict such evil upon him? Lies my mother doth speak, and deceit is what her mouth uttereth. This is the true tale of that which did happen,\" and the child proceeded to tell all that had passed—how Zuleika had tried first to persuade Joseph to act wickedly, and then had tried to force him to do her will. The people listened in great amazement. But the report finished, the child spake no word, as before. Abashed by the speech of his own infant son, Potiphar commanded his bailiffs to leave off from chastising Joseph, and the matter was brought into court, where priests sat as judges. Joseph protested his innocence, and related all that had happened according to the truth, but Potiphar repeated the account his wife had given him. The judges ordered the garment of Joseph to be brought which Zuleika had in her possession, and they examined the tear therein. It turned out to be on the front part of the mantle, and they came to the conclusion that Zuleika had tried to hold him fast, and had been foiled in her attempt by Joseph, against whom she was now lodging a trumped up charge. They decided that Joseph had not incurred the death penalty, but they condemned him to incarceration, because he was the cause of a stain upon Zuleika's fair name.\" Potiphar himself was convinced of Joseph's innocence, and when he cast him into prison, he said to him, \"I know that thou art not guilty of so vile a crime, but I must put thee in durance, lest a taint cling to my children.\"",

      "content": "By way of punishment for having traduced his ten brethren before his father, Joseph had to languish for ten years in the prison to which the wiles of traducers had in turn condemned him. But, on the other hand, as he had sanctified the Name of God before the world by his chastity and his steadfastness, he was rewarded. The letter He, which occurs twice in the Name of God, was added to his name. He had been called Joseph, but now he was called also Jehoseph. Though he was bound in prison, Joseph was not yet safe from the machinations of his mistress, whose passion for him was in no wise lessened. In truth it was she that had induced her husband to change his intention regarding Joseph; she urged him to imprison the slave rather than kill him, for she hoped that as a prisoner he could be made amenable to her wishes more easily. She spake to her husband, saying: \"Do not destroy thy property. Cast the slave in prison and keep him there until thou canst sell him, and receive back the money thou didst pay out for him.\" Thus she had the opportunity of visiting Joseph in his cell and trying to persuade him to do her will. She would say, \"This and that outrage have I executed against thee, but, as thou livest, I will put yet other outrages upon thee if thou dost not obey me.\" But Joseph replied, \"The Lord executeth judgment for the oppressed.\" Zuleika: \"I will push matters so far that all men will hate thee.\" Joseph: \"The Lord loveth the righteous.\" Zuleika: \"I will sell thee into a strange land.\" Joseph: \"The Lord preserveth the strangers.\" Then she would resort to enticements in order to obtain her desire. She would promise to release him from prison, if he would but grant her wish. But he would say, \"Better it is to remain here than be with thee and commit a trespass against God.\" These visits to Joseph in prison Zuleika continued for a long time, but when, finally, she saw that all her hopes were vain, she let him alone. As the mistress persisted in her love for Joseph, so his master, her husband, could not separate himself from his favorite slave. Though a prisoner, Joseph continued to minister to the needs of Potiphar, and he received permission from the keeper of the prison to spend some of his time in his master's house. In many other ways the jailer showed himself kindly disposed toward Joseph. Seeing the youth's zeal and conscientiousness in executing the tasks laid upon him, and under the spell of his enchanting beauty, he made prison life as easy as possible for his charge. He even ordered better dishes for him than the common prison fare, and he found it superfluous caution to keep watch over Joseph, for he could see no wrong in him, and he observed that God was with him, in good days and in bad. He even appointed him to be the overseer of the prison, and as Joseph commanded, so the other prisoners were obliged to do. For a long time the people talked of nothing but the accusation raised against Joseph by his mistress. In order to divert the attention of the public from him, God ordained that two high officers, the chief butler and the chief baker, should offend their lord, the king of Egypt, and they were put in ward in the house of the captain of the guard. Now the people ceased their talk about Joseph, and spoke only of the scandal at court. The charges laid at the door of the noble prisoners were that they had attempted to do violence to the daughter of Pharaoh, and they had conspired to poison the king himself. Besides, they had shown themselves derelict in their service. In the wine the chief butler had handed to the king to drink, a fly had been discovered, and the bread set upon the royal board by the chief baker contained a little pebble.\" On account of all these transgressions they were condemned to death by Pharaoh, but for the sake of Joseph it was ordained by Divine providence that the king should first detain them in prison before he ordered their execution. The Lord had enkindled the wrath of the king against his servants only that the wish of Joseph for liberty might be fulfilled, for they were the instruments of his deliverance from prison, and though they were doomed to death, yet in consideration of the exalted office they had held at court, the keeper of the prison accorded them privileges, as, for instance, a man was detailed to wait upon them, and the one appointed thereto was Joseph. 1] The chief butler and the chief baker had been confined in prison ten years, when they dreamed a dream, both of them, but as for the interpretation, each dreamed only that of the other one's dream. In the morning when Joseph brought them the water for washing, he found them sad, depressed in spirits, and, in the manner of the sages, he asked them why they looked different on that day from other days. They said unto him, \"We have dreamed a dream this night, and our two dreams resemble each other in certain particulars, and there is none that can interpret them.\" And Joseph said unto them: \"God granteth understanding to man to interpret dreams. Tell them me, I pray you.\" It was as a reward for ascribing greatness and credit to Him unto whom it belongeth that Joseph later attained to his lofty position. The chief butler proceeded to tell his dream: \"In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; and in the vine were three branches; and it was as though it budded, and its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes; and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.\" The chief butler was not aware that his dream contained a prophecy regarding the future of Israel, but Joseph discerned the recondite meaning, and he interpreted the dream thus: The three branches are the three Fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, whose descendants in Egypt will be redeemed by three leaders, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam; and the cup given into the hand of Pharaoh is the cup of wrath that he will have to drain in the end. This interpretation of the dream Joseph kept for himself, and he told the chief butler nothing thereof, but out of gratitude for the glad tidings of the deliverance of Israel from the bondage of Egypt, he gave him a favorable interpretation of his dream, and begged him to have him in his remembrance, when it should be well with him, and liberate him from the dungeon in which he was confined. When the chief baker heard the interpretation of the butler's dream, he knew that Joseph had divined its meaning correctly, for in his own he had seen the interpretation of his friend's dream, and he proceeded to tell Joseph what he had dreamed in the night: \"I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head; and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.\" Also this dream conveyed a prophecy regarding the future of Israel: The three baskets are the three kingdoms to which Israel will be made subject, Babylon, Media, and Greece; and the uppermost basket indicates the wicked rule of Rome, which will extend over all the nations of the world, until the bird shall come, who is the Messiah, and annihilate Rome. Again Joseph kept the prophecy a secret. To the chief baker he gave only the interpretation that had reference to his person, but it was unfavorable to him, because through his dream Joseph had been made acquainted with the suffering Israel would have to undergo. And all came to pass, as Joseph had said, on the third day. The day whereon he explained the meaning of their dreams to the two distinguished prisoners, a son was born unto Pharaoh and to celebrate the joyous event, the king arranged a feast for his princes and servants that was to last eight days. He invited them and all the people to his table, and he entertained them with royal splendor. The feast had its beginning on the third day after the birth of the child, and on that occasion the chief butler was restored in honor to his butlership, and the chief baker was hanged, for Pharaoh's counsellors had discovered that it was not the butler's fault that the fly had dropped into the king's wine, but the baker had been guilty of carelessness in allowing the pebble to get into the bread. Likewise it appeared that the butler had had no part in the conspiracy to poison the king, while the baker was revealed as one of the plotters, and he had to expiate his crime with his life.",

      "content": "Properly speaking, Joseph should have gone out free from his dungeon on the same day as the butler. He had been there ten years by that time, and had made amends for the slander he had uttered against his ten brethren. However, he remained in prison two years longer. \"Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope is the Lord,\" but Joseph had put his confidence in flesh and blood. He had prayed the chief butler to have him in remembrance when it should be well with him, and make mention of him unto Pharaoh, and the butler forgot his promise, and therefore Joseph had to stay in prison two years more than the years originally allotted to him there. The butler had not forgotten him intentionally, but it was ordained of God that his memory should fail him. When he would say to himself, If thus and so happens, I will remember the case of Joseph, the conditions he had imagined were sure to be reversed, or if he made a knot as a reminder, an angel came and undid the knot, and Joseph did not enter his mind. But \"the Lord setteth an end to darkness,\" and Joseph's liberation was not delayed by a single moment beyond the time decreed for it. God said, \"Thou, O butler, thou didst forget Joseph, but I did not,\" and He caused Pharaoh to dream a dream that was the occasion for Joseph's release. In his dream Pharaoh saw seven kine, well-favored and fat-fleshed, come up out of the Nile, and they all together grazed peaceably on the brink of the river, In years when the harvest is abundant, friendship reigns among men, and love and brotherly harmony, and these seven fat kine stood for seven such prosperous years. After the fat kine, seven more came up out of the river, ill-favored and leanfleshed, and each had her back turned to the others, for when distress prevails, one man turns away from the other. For a brief space Pharaoh awoke, and when he went to sleep again, he dreamed a second dream, about seven rank and good ears of corn, and seven ears that were thin and blasted with the east wind, the withered cars swallowing the full ears. He awoke at once, and it was morning, and dreams dreamed in the morning are the ones that come true. This was not the first time Pharaoh had had these dreams. They had visited him every night during a period of two years, and he had forgotten them invariably in the morning. This was the first time he remembered them, for the day had arrived for Joseph to come forth from his prison house. Pharaoh's heart beat violently when he called his dreams to mind on awaking. Especially the second one, about the ears of corn, disquieted him. He reflected that whatever has a mouth can eat, and therefore the dream of the seven lean kine that ate up the seven fat kine did not appear strange to him. But the ears of corn that swallowed up other ears of corn troubled his spirit. He therefore called for all the wise men of his land, and they endeavored in vain to find a satisfactory interpretation. They explained that the seven fat kine meant seven daughters to be born unto Pharaoh, and the seven lean kine, that he would bury seven daughters; the rank ears of corn meant that Pharaoh would conquer seven countries, and the blasted ears, that seven provinces would rebel against him. About the ears of corn they did not all agree. Some thought the good ears stood for seven cities to be built by Pharaoh, and the seven withered ears indicated that these same cities would be destroyed at the end of his reign. Sagacious as he was, Pharaoh knew that none of these explanations hit the nail on the head. He issued a decree summoning all interpreters of dreams to appear before him on pain of death, and he held out great rewards and distinctions to the one who should succeed in finding the true meaning of his dreams. In obedience to his summons, all the wise men appeared, the magicians and the sacred scribes that were in Mizraim, the city of Egypt, as well as those from Goshen, Raamses, Zoan, and the whole country of Egypt, and with them came the princes, officers, and servants of the king from all the cities of the land. To all these the king narrated his dreams, but none could interpret them to his satisfaction. Some said that the seven fat kine were the seven legitimate kings that would rule over Egypt, and the seven lean kine betokened seven princes that would rise up against these seven kings and exterminate them. The seven good ears of corn were the seven superior princes of Egypt that would engage in a war for their overlord, and would be defeated by as many insignificant princes, who were betokened by the seven blasted ears. Another interpretation was that the seven fat kine were the seven fortified cities of Egypt, at some future time to fall into the hands of seven Canaanitish nations, who were foreshadowed in the seven lean kine. According to this interpretation, the second dream supplemented the first. It meant that the descendants of Pharaoh would regain sovereign authority over Egypt at a subsequent period, and would subdue the seven Canaanitish nations as well. There was a third interpretation, given by some: The seven fat kine are seven women whom Pharaoh would take to wife, but they would die during his lifetime, their loss being indicated by the seven lean kine. Furthermore, Pharaoh would have fourteen sons, and the seven strong ones would be conquered by the seven weaklings, as the blasted ears of corn in his dream had swallowed up the rank ears of corn. And a fourth: \"Thou wilt have seven sons, O Pharaoh, these are the seven fat kine. These sons of thine will be killed by the seven powerful rebellious princes. But then seven minor princes will come, and they will kill the seven rebels, avenge thy descendants, and restore the dominion to thy family.\" The king was as little pleased with these interpretations as with the others, which he had heard before, and in his wrath he ordered the wise men, the magicians and the scribes of Egypt, to be killed, and the hangmen made ready to execute the royal decree. However, Mirod, Pharaoh's chief butler, took fright, seeing that the king was so vexed at his failure to secure an interpretation of his dreams that he was on the point of giving up the ghost. He was alarmed about the king's death, for it was doubtful whether the successor to the throne would retain him in office. He resolved to do all in his power to keep Pharaoh alive. Therefore he stepped before him, and spake, saying, \"I do remember two faults of mine this day, I showed myself ungrateful to Joseph, in that I did not bring his request before thee, and also I saw thee in distress by reason of thy dream, without letting thee know that Joseph can interpret dreams. When it pleased the Lord God to make Pharaoh wroth with his servants, the king put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker. And with us there was a simple young man, one of the despised race of the Hebrews, slave to the captain of the guard, and he interpreted our dreams to us, and it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was. Therefore, O king, stay the hand of the hangmen, let them not execute the Egyptians. The slave I speak of is still in the dungeon, and if the king will consent to summon him hither, he will surely interpret thy dreams.\"",

      "content": "\"Accursed are the wicked that never do a wholly good deed.\" The chief butler described Joseph contemptuously as a \"slave\" in order that it might be impossible for him to occupy a distinguished place at court, for it was a law upon the statute books of Egypt that a slave could never sit upon the throne as king, nor even put his foot in the stirrup of a horse. Pharaoh revoked the edict of death that he had issued against the wise men of Egypt, and he sent and called Joseph. He impressed care upon his messengers, they were not to excite and confuse Joseph, and render him unfit to interpret the king's dream correctly. They brought him hastily out of the dungeon, but first Joseph, out of respect for the king, shaved himself, and put on fresh raiment, which an angel brought him from Paradise, and then he came in unto Pharaoh. The king was sitting upon the royal throne, arrayed in princely garments, clad with a golden ephod upon his breast, and the fine gold of the ephod sparkled, and the carbuncle, the ruby, and the emerald flamed like a torch, and all the precious stones set upon the king's head flashed like a blazing fire, and Joseph was greatly amazed at the appearance of the king. The throne upon which he sat was covered with gold and silver and with onyx stones, and it had seventy steps. If a prince or other distinguished person came to have an audience with the king, it was the custom for him to advance and mount to the thirty-first step of the throne, and the king would descend thirty-six steps and speak to him. But if one of the people came to have speech with the king, he ascended only to the third step, and the king would come down four steps from his seat, and address him thence. It was also the custom that one who knew all the seventy languages ascended the seventy steps of the throne to the top, but if a man knew only some of the seventy languages, he was permitted to ascend as many steps as he knew languages, whether they were many or, few. And another custom of the Egyptians was that none could reign over them unless he was master of all the seventy languages. When Joseph came before the king, he bowed down to the ground, and he ascended to the third step, while the king sat upon the fourth from the top, and spake with Joseph, saying: \"O young man, my servant beareth witness concerning thee, that thou art the best and most discerning person I can consult with. I pray thee, vouchsafe unto me the same favors which thou didst bestow on this servant of mine, and tell me what events they are which the visions of my dreams foreshow. I desire thee to suppress naught out of fear, nor shalt thou flatter me with lying words, or with words that please me. Tell me the truth, though it be sad and alarming.\" Joseph asked the king first whence he knew that the interpretation given by the wise men of his country was not true, and Pharaoh replied, \"I saw the dream and its interpretation together, and therefore they cannot make a fool of me.\" In his modesty Joseph denied that he was an adept at interpreting dreams. He said, \"It is not in me; it is in the hand of God, and if it be the wish of God, He will permit me to announce tidings of peace to Pharaoh.\" And for such modesty he was rewarded by sovereignty over Egypt, for the Lord doth honor them that honor Him. Thus was also Daniel rewarded for his speech to Nebuchadnezzar: \"There is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, but as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart.\" Then Pharaoh began to tell his dream, only he omitted some points and narrated others inaccurately in order that he might test the vaunted powers of Joseph. But the youth corrected him, and pieced the dreams together exactly as they had visited Pharaoh in the night, and the king was greatly amazed. Joseph was able to accomplish this feat, because he had dreamed the same dream as Pharaoh, at the same time as he. Thereupon Pharaoh retold his dreams, with all details and circumstances, and precisely as he had seen them in his sleep, except that he left out the word Nile in the description of the seven lean kine, because this river was worshipped by the Egyptians, and he hesitated to say that aught that is evil had come from his god. Now Joseph proceeded to give the king the true interpretation of the two dreams. They were both a revelation concerning the seven good years impending and the seven years of famine to follow them. In reality, it had been the purpose of God to bring a famine of forty-two years' duration upon Egypt, but only two years of this distressful period were inflicted upon the land, for the sake of the blessing of Jacob when he came to Egypt in the second year of the famine. The other forty years fell upon the land at the time of the prophet Ezekiel. Joseph did more than merely interpret the dreams. When the king gave voice to doubts concerning the interpretation, he told him signs and tokens. He said: \"Let this be a sign to thee that my words are true, and my advice is excellent: Thy wife, who is sitting upon the birthstool at this moment, will bring forth a son, and thou wilt rejoice over him, but in the midst of thy joy the sad tidings will be told thee of the death of thine older son, who was born unto thee but two years ago, and thou must needs find consolation for the loss of the one in the birth of the other.\" Scarcely had Joseph withdrawn from the presence of the king, when the report of the birth of a son was brought to Pharaoh, and soon after also the report of the death of his first-born, who had suddenly dropped to the floor and passed away. Thereupon he sent for all the grandees of his realm, and all his servants, and he spake to them, saying: \"Ye have heard the words of the Hebrew, and ye have seen that the signs which he foretold were accomplished, and I also know that he hath interpreted the dream truly. Advise me now how the land may be saved from the ravages of the famine. Look hither and thither whether you can find a man of wisdom and understanding, whom I may set over the land, for I am convinced that the land can be saved only if we heed the counsel of the Hebrew.\" The grandees and the princes admitted that safety could be secured only by adhering to the advice given by Joseph, and they proposed that the king, in his sagacity, choose a man whom he considered equal to the great task. Thereupon Pharaoh said: \"If we traversed and searched the earth from end to end, we could find none such as Joseph, a man in whom is the spirit of God. If ye think well thereof, I will set him over the land which he hath saved by his wisdom.\" The astrologers, who were his counsellors, demurred, saying, \"A slave, one whom his present owner hath acquired for twenty pieces of silver, thou proposest to set over us as master?\" But Pharaoh maintained that Joseph was not only a free-born man beyond the peradventure of a doubt, but also the scion of a noble family. However, the princes of Pharaoh were not silenced, they continued to give utterance to their opposition to Joseph, saying: \"Dost thou not remember the immutable law of the Egyptians, that none may serve as king or as viceroy unless he speaks all the languages of men? And this Hebrew knows none but his own tongue, and how were it possible that a man should rule over us who cannot even speak the language of our land? Send and have him fetched hither, and examine him in respect to all the things a ruler should know and have, and then decide as seemeth wise in thy sight.\" Pharaoh yielded, he promised to do as they wished, and he appointed the following day as the time for examining Joseph, who had returned to his prison in the meantime, for, on account of his wife, his master feared to have him stay in his house. During the night Gabriel appeared unto Joseph, and taught him all the seventy languages, and he acquired them quickly after the angel had changed his name from Joseph to Jehoseph. The next morning, when he came into the presence of Pharaoh and the nobles of the kingdom, inasmuch as he knew every one of the seventy languages, he mounted all the steps of the royal throne, until he reached the seventieth, the highest, upon which sat the king, and Pharaoh and his princes rejoiced that Joseph fulfilled all the requirements needed by one that was to rule over Egypt. The king said to Joseph: \"Thou didst give me the counsel to look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt, that he may in his wisdom save the land from the famine. As God hath showed thee all this, and as thou art master of all the languages of the world, there is none so discreet and wise as thou. Thou shalt therefore be the second in the land after Pharaoh, and according unto thy word shall all my people go in and go out; my princes and my servants shall receive their monthly appanage from thee; before thee the people shall prostrate themselves, only in the throne will I be greater than thou.\"",

      "content": "Now Joseph reaped the harvest of his virtues, and according to the measure of his merits God granted him reward. The mouth that refused the kiss of unlawful passion and sin received the kiss of homage from the people; the neck that did not bow itself unto sin was adorned with the gold chain that Pharaoh put upon it; the hands that did not touch sin wore the signet ring that Pharaoh took from his own hand and put upon Joseph's; the body that did not come in contact with sin was arrayed in vestures of byssus; the feet that made no steps in the direction of sin reposed in the royal chariot, and the thoughts that kept themselves undefiled by sin were proclaimed as wisdom. Joseph was installed in his high position, and invested with the insignia of his office, with solemn ceremony. The king took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in princely apparel, and set a gold crown upon his head, and laid a gold chain about his neck. Then he commanded his servants to make Joseph to ride in his second chariot, which went by the side of the chariot wherein sat the king, and he also made him to ride upon a great and strong horse of the king's horses, and his servants conducted him through the streets of the city of Egypt. Musicians, no less than a thousand striking cymbals and a thousand blowing flutes, and five thousand men with drawn swords gleaming in the air formed the vanguard. Twenty thousand of the king's grandees girt with gold-embroidered leather belts marched at the right of Joseph, and as many at the left of him. The women and the maidens of the nobility looked out of the windows to gaze upon Joseph's beauty, and they poured down chains upon him, and rings and jewels, that he might but direct his eyes toward them. Yet he did not look up, and as a reward God made him proof against the evil eye, nor has it ever had the power of inflicting harm upon any of his descendants. Servants of the king, preceding him and following him, burnt incense upon his path, and cassia, and all manner of sweet spices, and strewed myrrh and aloes wherever he went. Twenty heralds walked before him, and they proclaimed: \"This is the man whom the king bath chosen to be the second after him. All the affairs of state will be administered by him, and whoever resisteth his commands, or refuseth to bow down to the ground before him, he will die the death of the rebel against the king and the king's deputy.\" Without delay the people prostrated themselves, and they cried, \"Long live the king, and long live the deputy of the king!\" And Joseph, looking down from his horse upon the people and their exultation, exclaimed, his eyes directed heavenward: \"The Lord raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the needy from the dunghill. O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in Thee.\" After Joseph, accompanied by Pharaoh's officers and princes, had journeyed through the whole city of Egypt, and viewed all there was therein, he returned to the king on the selfsame day, and the king gave him fields and vineyards as a present, and also three thousand talents of silver, and a thousand talents of gold, and onyx stones and bdellium, and many other costly things. The king commanded, moreover, that every Egyptian give Joseph a gift, else he would be put to death. A platform was erected in the open street, and there all deposited their presents, and among the things were many of gold and silver, as well as precious stones, carried thither by the people and also the grandees, for they saw that Joseph enjoyed the favor of the king. Furthermore, Joseph received one hundred slaves from Pharaoh, and they were to do all his bidding, and he himself acquired many more, for he resided in a spacious palace. Three years it took to build it. Special magnificence was lavished upon the hall of state, which was his audience chamber, and upon the throne fashioned of gold and silver and inlaid with precious stones, whereon there was a representation of the whole land of Egypt and of the river Nile. And as Joseph multiplied in riches, so he increased also in wisdom, for God added to his wisdom that all might love and honor him. Pharaoh called him Zaphenath-paneah, he who can reveal secret things with ease, and rejoiceth the heart of man therewith. Each letter of the name Zaphenath-paneah has a meaning, too. The first, Zadde, stands for Zofeh, seer; Pe for Podeh, redeemer; Nun for Nabi, prophet; Taw for Tomek, supporter; Pe for Poter, interpreter of dreams; Ain for Arum, clever; Nun for Nabon, discreet; and Het for Hakam, wise. The name of Joseph's wife pointed to her history in the same way. Asenath was the daughter of Dinah and Hamor, but she was abandoned at the borders of Egypt, only, that people might know who she was, Jacob engraved the story of her parentage and her birth upon a gold plate fastened around her neck. The day on which Asenath was exposed, Potiphar went walking with his servants near the city wall, and they heard the voice of a child. At the captain's bidding they brought the baby to him, and when he read her history from the gold plate, he determined to adopt her. He took her home with him, and raised her as his daughter. The Alef in Asenath stands for On, where Potiphar was priest; the Samek for Setirah, Hidden, for she was kept concealed on account of her extraordinary beauty; the Nun for Nohemet, for she wept and entreated that she might be delivered from the house of the heathen Potiphar; and the Taw for Tammah, the perfect one, on account of her pious, perfect deeds. Asenath had saved Joseph's life while she was still an infant in arms. When Joseph was accused of immoral conduct by Potiphar's wife and the other women, and his master was on the point of having him hanged, Asenath approached her foster-father, and she assured him under oath that the charge against Joseph was false. Then spake God, \"As thou livest, because thou didst try to defend Joseph, thou shalt be the woman to bear the tribes that he is appointed to beget. Asenath bore him two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, during the seven years of plenty, for in the time of famine Joseph refrained from all indulgence in the pleasures of life. They were bred in chastity and fear of God by their father, and they were wise, and well-instructed in all knowledge and in the affairs of state, so that they became the favorites of the court, and were educated with the royal princes. Before the famine broke over the land, Joseph found an opportunity of rendering the king a great service. He equipped an army of four thousand six hundred men, providing all the soldiers with shields and spears and bucklers and helmets and slings. With this army, and aided by the servants and officers of the king, and by the people of Egypt, he carried on a war with Tarshish in the first year after his appointment as viceroy. The people of Tarshish had invaded the territory of the Ishmaelites, and the latter, few in number at that time, were sore pressed, and applied to the king of Egypt for help against their enemies. At the head of his host of heroes, Joseph marched to the land of Havilah, where he was joined by the Ishmaelites, and with united forces they fought against the people of Tarshish, routed them utterly, settled their land with the Ishmaelites, while the defeated men took refuge with their brethren in Javan. Joseph and his army returned to Egypt, and not a man had they lost. In a little while Joseph's prophecy was confirmed: that year and the six following years were years of plenty, as he had foretold. The harvest was so ample that a single ear produced two heaps of grain, and Joseph made circumspect arrangements to provide abundantly for the years of famine. He gathered up all the grain, and in the city situated in the middle of each district he laid up the produce from round about, and had ashes and earth strewn on the garnered food from the very soil on which it had been grown; also he preserved the grain in the ear; all these being precautions taken to guard against rot and mildew. The inhabitants of Egypt also tried, on their own account, to put aside a portion of the superabundant harvest of the seven fruitful years against the need of the future, but when the grievous time of dearth came, and they went to their storehouses to bring forth the treasured grain, behold, it had rotted, and become unfit for food. The famine broke in upon the people with such suddenness that the bread gave out unexpectedly as they sat at their tables, they had not even a bite of bran bread. Thus they were driven to apply to Joseph and beseech his help, and he admonished them, saying, \"Give up your allegiance to your deceitful idols, and say, Blessed is He who giveth bread unto all flesh.\" But they refused to deny their lying gods, and they betook themselves to Pharaoh, only to be told by him, \"Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do!\" For this Pharaoh was rewarded. God granted him long life and a long reign, until he became arrogant, and well-merited punishment overtook him. When the Egyptians approached Joseph with the petition for bread, he spoke, saying, \"I give no food to the uncircumcised. Go hence, and circumcise yourselves, and then return hither.\" They entered the presence of Pharaoh, and complained to him regarding Joseph, but he said as before, \"Go unto Joseph!\" And they replied, \"We come from Joseph, and he hath spoken roughly unto us, saying, Go hence and circumcise yourselves! We warned thee in the beginning that he is a Hebrew, and would treat us in such wise.\" Pharaoh said to them: \"O ye fools, did he not prophesy through the holy spirit and proclaim to the whole world, that there would come seven years of plenty to be followed by seven years of dearth? Why did you not save the yield of one or two years against the day of your need?\" Weeping, they made reply: \"The grain that we put aside during the good years hath rotted.\" Pharaoh: \"Have ye nothing over of the flour of yesterday?\" The Egyptians: \"The very bread in the basket rotted!\" Pharaoh: \"Why?\" The Egyptians: \"Because Joseph willed thus!\" Pharaoh: \"O ye fools, if his word hath power over the grain, making it to rot when he desireth it to rot, then also must we die, if so be his wish concerning us. Go, therefore, unto him, and do as he bids you.\"",

      "content": "The famine, which inflicted hardships first upon the wealthy among the Egyptians, gradually extended its ravages as far as Phoenicia, Arabia, and Palestine. Though the sons of Jacob, being young men, frequented the streets and the highways, yet they were ignorant of what their old home-keeping father Jacob knew, that corn could be procured in Egypt. Jacob even suspected that Joseph was in Egypt. His prophetic spirit, which forsook him during the time of his grief for his son, yet manifested itself now and again in dim visions, and he was resolved to send his sons down into Egypt. There was another reason. Though he was not yet in want, he nevertheless had them go thither for food, because he was averse from arousing the envy of the sons of Esau and Ishmael by his comfortable state. For the same reason, to avoid friction with the surrounding peoples, he bade his sons not appear in public with bread in their hands, or in the accoutrements of war. And as he knew that they were likely to attract attention, on account of their heroic stature and handsome appearance, he cautioned them against going to the city all together through the same gate, or, indeed, showing themselves all together anywhere in public, that the evil eye be not cast upon them. The famine in Canaan inspired Joseph with the hope of seeing his brethren. To make sure of their coming, he issued a decree concerning the purchase of corn in Egypt, as follows: \"By order of the king and his deputy, and the princes of the realm, be it enacted that he who desireth to buy grain in Egypt may not send his slave hither to do his bidding, but he must charge his own sons therewith. An Egyptian or a Canaanite that hath bought grain and then selleth it again shall be put to death, for none may buy more than he requireth for the needs of his household. Also, who cometh with two or three beasts of burden, and loads them up with grain, shall be put to death.\" At the gates of the city of Egypt, Joseph stationed guards, whose office was to inquire and take down the name of all that should come to buy corn, and also the name of their father and their grandfather, and every evening the list of names thus made was handed to Joseph. These precautions were bound to bring Joseph's brethren down to Egypt, and also acquaint him with their coming as soon as they entered the land. On their journey his brethren thought more of Joseph than of their errand. They said to one another: \"We know that Joseph was carried down into Egypt, and we will make search for him there, and if we should find him, we will ransom him from his master, and if his master should refuse to sell him, we will use force, though we perish ourselves.\" At the gates of the city of Egypt, the brethren of Joseph were asked what their names were, and the names of their father and grandfather. The guard on duty happened to be Manasseh, the son of Joseph. The brethren submitted to being questioned, saying \"Let us go into the town, and we shall see whether this taking down of our names be a matter of taxes. If it be so, we shall not demur; but if it be something else, we shall see to-morrow what can be done in the case.\" On the evening of the day they entered Egypt, Joseph discovered their names in the list, which he was in the habit of examining daily, and he commanded that all stations for the sale of corn be closed, except one only. Furthermore, even at this station no sales were to be negotiated unless the name of the would-be purchaser was first obtained. His brethren, with whose names Joseph furnished the overseer of the place, were to be seized and brought to him as soon as they put in appearance. But the first thought of the brethren was for Joseph, and their first concern, to seek him. For three days they made search for him everywhere, even in the most disreputable quarters of the city. Meantime Joseph was in communication with the overseer of the station kept open for the sale of corn, and, hearing that his brethren had not appeared there, he dispatched some of his servants to look for them, but they found them neither in Mizraim, the city of Egypt, nor in Goshen, nor in Raamses. Thereupon he sent sixteen servants forth to make a house to house search for them in the city, and they discovered the brethren of Joseph in a place of ill-fame and haled them before their master.",

      "content": "A large crown of gold on his head, apparelled in byssus and purple, and surrounded by his valiant men, Joseph was seated upon his throne in his palace. His brethren fell down before him in great admiration of his beauty, his stately appearance, and his majesty. They did not know him, for when Joseph was sold into slavery, he was a beardless youth. But he knew his brethren, their appearance had not changed in aught, for they were bearded men when he was separated from them. He was inclined to make himself known to them as their brother, but an angel appeared unto him, the same that had brought him from Shechem to his brethren at Dothan, and spoke, saying, \"These came hither with intent to kill thee.\" Later, when the brethren returned home, and gave an account of their adventures to Jacob, they told him that a man had accused them falsely before the ruler of Egypt, not knowing that he who incited Joseph against them was an angel. It was in reference to this matter, and meaning their accuser, that Jacob, when he dispatched his sons on their second expedition to Egypt, prayed to God, \"God Almighty give you mercy before the man.\" Joseph made himself strange unto his brethren, and he took his cup in his hand, knocked against it, and said, \"By this magic cup I know that ye are spies.\" They replied, \"Thy servants came from Canaan into Egypt for to buy corn.\" Joseph: \"If it be true that ye came hither to buy corn, why is it that each one of you entered the city by a separate gate?\" The brethren: \"We are ALL the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and he bade us not enter a city together by the same gate, that we attract not the attention of the people of the place.\" Unconsciously they had spoken as seers, for the word ALL included Joseph as one of their number. Joseph: \"Verily, ye are spies! All the people that come to buy corn return home without delay, but ye have lingered here three days, without making any purchases, and all the time you have been gadding about in the disreputable parts of the city, and only spies are wont to do thus.\" The brethren: \"We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of the Hebrew Abraham. The youngest is this day with our father in Canaan, and one hath disappeared. Him did we look for in this land, and we looked for him even in the disreputable houses.\" Joseph: \"Have ye made search in every other place on earth, and was Egypt the only land left? And if it be true that he is in Egypt, what should a brother of yours be doing in a house of ill-fame, if, indeed, ye are the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob?\" The brethren: \"We did hear that some Ishmaelites stole our brother, and sold him into slavery in Egypt, and as our brother was exceeding fair in form and face, we thought he might have been sold for illicit uses, and therefore we searched even the disreputable houses to find him.\" Joseph: \"You speak deceitful words, when you call yourselves sons of Abraham. By the life of Pharaoh, ye are spies, and you did go from one disreputable house to another that none might discover you.\" The expression \"by the life of Pharaoh\" might have betrayed Joseph's real feeling to his brethren, had they but known his habit of taking this oath only when he meant to avoid keeping his word later. Joseph continued to speak to his brethren: \"Let us suppose you should discover your brother serving as a slave, and his master should demand a high sum for his ransom, would you pay it?\" The brethren: \"Yes!\" Joseph: \"But suppose his master should refuse to surrender him for any price in the world, what would you do?\" The brethren: \"If he yields not our brother to us, we will kill the master, and carry off our brother.\" Joseph: \"Now see how true my words were, that ye are spies. By your own admission ye have come to slay the inhabitants of the land. Report hath told us that two of you did massacre the people of Shechem on account of the wrong done to your sister, and now have ye come down into Egypt to kill the Egyptians for the sake of your brother. I shall be convinced of your innocence only if you consent to send one of your number home and fetch your youngest brother hither.\" His brethren refused compliance, and Joseph caused them to be put into prison by seventy of his valiant men, and there they remained for three days. God never allows the pious to languish in distress longer than three days, and so it was a Divine dispensation that the brethren of Joseph were released on the third day, and were permitted by Joseph to return home, on condition, however, that one of them remain behind as hostage. The difference between Joseph and his brethren can be seen here. Though he retained one of them to be bound in the prison house, he still said, \"I fear God,\" and dismissed the others, but when he was in their power, they gave no thought to God. At this time, to be sure, their conduct was such as is becoming to the pious, who accept their fate with calm resignation, and acknowledge the righteousness of God, for He metes out reward and punishment measure for measure. They recognized that their present punishment was in return for the heartless treatment they had dealt out to Joseph, paying no heed to his distress, though he fell at the feet of each of them, weeping, and entreating them not to sell him into slavery. Reuben reminded the others that they had two wrongs to expiate, the wrong against their brother and the wrong against their father, who was so grieved that he exclaimed, \"I will go down to the grave to my son mourning.\" The brethren of Joseph knew not that the viceroy of Egypt understood Hebrew, and could follow their words, for Manasseh stood and was an interpreter between them and him. Joseph decided to keep Simon as hostage in Egypt, for he had been one of the two—Levi was the other—to advise that Joseph be put to death, and only the intercession of Reuben and Judah had saved him. He did not detain Levi, too, for he feared, if both remained behind together, Egypt might suffer the same fate at their hands as the city of Shechem. Also, he preferred Simon to Levi, because Simon was not a favorite among the sons of Jacob, and they would not resist his detention in Egypt too violently, while they might annihilate Egypt, as aforetime Shechem, if they were deprived of Levi, their wise man and high priest. Besides, it was Simon that had lowered Joseph into the pit, wherefore he had a particular grudge against him. When the brethren yielded to Joseph's demand, and consented to leave their brother behind as hostage, Simon said to them, \"Ye desire to do with me as ye did with Joseph!\" But they replied, in despair: \"What can we do? Our households will perish of hunger.\" Simon made answer, \"Do as ye will, but as for me, let me see the man that will venture to cast me into prison.\" Joseph sent word to Pharaoh to let him have seventy of his valiant men, to aid him in arresting robbers. But when the seventy appeared upon the scene, and were about to lay hands on Simon, he uttered a loud cry, and his assailants fell to the floor and knocked out their teeth. Pharaoh's valiant men, as well as all the people that stood about Joseph, fled affrighted, only Joseph and his son Manasseh remained calm and unmoved. Manasseh rose up, dealt Simon a blow on the back of his neck, put manacles upon his hands and fetters upon his feet, and cast him into prison. Joseph's brethren were greatly amazed at the heroic strength of the youth, and Simon said, \"This blow was not dealt by an Egyptian, but by one belonging to our house.\" He was bound and taken to prison before the eyes of the other brethren of Joseph, but as soon as they were out of sight, Joseph ordered good fare to be set before him, and he treated him with great kindness. Joseph permitted his nine other brethren to depart, carrying corn with them in abundance, but he impressed upon them that they must surely return and bring their youngest brother with them. On the way, Levi, who felt lonely without his constant companion Simon, opened his sack, and he espied the money he had paid for the corn. They all trembled, and their hearts failed them, and they said, \"Where, then, is the lovingkindness of God toward our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, seeing that He hath delivered us into the hands of the Egyptian king, that he may raise false accusations against us?\" And Judah said, \"Verily, we are guilty concerning our brother, we have sinned against God, in that we sold our brother, our own flesh, and why do ye ask, Where, then, is the lovingkindness of God toward our fathers?\" Reuben spoke in the same way: \"Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child, and ye would not hear? And now the Lord doth demand him of us. How can you say, Where, then, is the lovingkindness of God toward our fathers, though you have sinned against Him?\" They proceeded on their journey home, and their father met them on the way. Jacob was astonished not to see Simon with them, and in reply to his questions, they told him all that had befallen them in Egypt. Then Jacob cried out: \"What have ye done? I sent Joseph to you to see whether it be well with you, and ye said, An evil beast hath devoured him. Simon went forth with you for to buy corn, and you say, The king of Egypt hath cast him into prison. And now ye will take Benjamin away and kill him, too. Ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\" The words of Jacob, which he uttered, \"Me have ye bereaved of my children,\" were meant to intimate to his sons that he suspected them of the death of Joseph and of Simon's disappearance as well, and their reports concerning both he regarded as inventions. What made him inconsolable was that now, having lost two of his sons, he could not hope to see the Divine promise fulfilled, that he should be the ancestor of twelve tribes. He was quite resolved in his mind, therefore, not to let Benjamin go away with his brethren under any condition whatsoever, and he vouchsafed Reuben no reply when he said, \"Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee.\" He considered it beneath his dignity to give an answer to such balderdash. \"My first-born son,\" he said to himself, \"is a fool. What will it profit me, if I slay his two sons? Does he not know that his sons are equally mine?\" Judah advised his brethren to desist from urging their father then; he would consent, he thought, to whatever expedients were found necessary, as soon as their bread gave out, and a second journey to Egypt became imperative.",

      "content": "When the supplies bought in Egypt were eaten up, and the family of Jacob began to suffer with hunger, the little children came to him, and they said, \"Give us bread, that we die not of hunger before thee.\" The words of the little ones brought scorching tears to the eyes of Jacob, and he summoned his sons and bade them go again down into Egypt and buy food. But Judah spake unto him, \"The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying that we should not see his face, except our brother Benjamin be with us, and we cannot appear before him with idle pretexts.\" And Jacob said, \"Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?\" It was the first and only time Jacob indulged in empty talk, and God said, \"I made it My business to raise his son to the position of ruler of Egypt, and he complains, and says, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with-me?\" And Judah protested against the reproach, that he had initiated the Egyptian viceroy in their family relations, with the words: \"Why, he knew the very wood of which our baby coaches are made! Father,\" he continued, \"if Benjamin goes with us, he may, indeed, be taken from us, but also he may not. This is a doubtful matter, but it is certain that if he does not go with us, we shall all die of hunger. It is better not to concern thyself about what is doubtful, and guide thy actions by what is certain. The king of Egypt is a strong and mighty king, and if we go to him without our brother, we shall all be put to death. Dost thou not know, and hast thou not heard, that this king is very powerful and wise, and there is none like unto him in all the earth? We have seen all the kings of the earth, but none like unto the king of Egypt. One would surely say that among all the kings of the earth there is none greater than Abimelech king of the Philistines, yet the king of Egypt is greater and mightier than he, and Abimelech can hardly be compared with one of his officers. Father, thou hast not seen his palace and his throne, and all his servants standing before him. Thou hast not seen that king upon his throne, in all his magnificence and with his royal insignia, arrayed in his royal robes, with a large golden crown upon his head. Thou hast not seen the honor and the glory that God hath given unto him, for there is none like unto him in all the earth. Father, thou hast not seen the wisdom, the understanding, and the knowledge that God has given in his heart. We heard his sweet voice when he spake unto us. We know not, father, who acquainted him with our names, and all that befell us. He asked also concerning thee, saying, Is your father still alive, and is it well with him? Thou hast not seen the affairs of the government of Egypt regulated by him, for none asketh his lord Pharaoh about them. Thou hast not seen the awe and the fear that he imposes upon all the Egyptians. Even we went out from his presence threatening to do unto Egypt as unto the cities of the Amorites, and exceedingly wroth by reason of all his words that he spake concerning us as spies, yet when we came again before him, his terror fell upon us all, and none of us was able to speak a word to him, great or small. Now, therefore, father, send the lad with us, and we will arise and go down into Egypt, and buy food to eat, that we die not of hunger.\" Judah offered his portion in the world to come as surety for Benjamin, and thus solemnly he promised to bring him back safe and sound, and Jacob granted his request, and permitted Benjamin to go down into Egypt with his other sons. They also carried with them choice presents from their father for the ruler of Egypt, things that arouse wonder outside of Palestine, such as the murex, which is the snail that produces the Tyrian purple, and various kinds of balm, and almond oil, and pistachio oil, and honey as hard as stone. Furthermore, Jacob put double money in their hand to provide against a rise in prices in the meantime. And after all these matters were attended to, he spake to his sons, saying: \"Here is money, and here is a present, and also your brother. Is there aught else that you need?\" And they replied, Yes, we need this, besides, that thou shouldst intercede for us with God.\" Then their father prayed: \"O Lord, Thou who at the time of creation didst call Enough! to heaven and earth when they stretched themselves out further and further toward infinity, set a limit to my sufferings, too, say unto them, Enough! God Almighty give you mercy before the ruler of Egypt, that he may release unto you Joseph, Simon, and Benjamin.\" This prayer was an intercession, not only for the sons of Jacob, but also for their descendants—that God would deliver the Ten Tribes in time to come, as He delivered the two, Judah and Benjamin, and after He permitted the destruction of two Temples, He would grant endless continuance to the third. Jacob also put a letter addressed to the viceroy of Egypt into the hands of his son. The letter ran thus: \"From thy servant Jacob, the son of Isaac, the grandson of Abraham, prince of God, to the mighty and wise king Zaphenathpaneah, the ruler of Egypt, peace! I make known unto my lord the king that the famine is sore with us in the land of Canaan, and I have therefore sent my sons unto thee, to buy us a little food, that we may live, and not die. My children surrounded me, and begged for something to eat, but, alas, I am very old, and I cannot see with mine eyes, for they are heavy with the weight of years, and also on account of my never-ceasing tears for my son Joseph, who hath been taken from me. I charged my sons not to pass through the gate all together at the same time, when they arrived in the city of Egypt, in consideration of the inhabitants of the land, that they might not take undue notice of them. Also I bade them go up and down in the land of Egypt and seek my son Joseph, mayhap they would find him there. \"This did they do, but thou didst therefore account them as spies. We have heard the report of thy wisdom and sagacity. How, then, canst thou look upon their countenances, and yet declare them to be spies? Especially as we have heard thou didst interpret Pharaoh's dream, and didst foretell the coming of the famine, are we amazed that thou, in thy discernment, couldst not distinguish whether they be spies or not. \"And, now, O my lord king, I send unto thee my son Benjamin, as thou didst demand of my other sons. I pray thee, take good care of him until thou sendest him back to me in peace with his brethren. Hast thou not heard, and dost thou not know, what our God did unto Pharaoh when he took our mother Sarah unto himself? Or what happened unto Abimelech on account of her? And what our father Abraham did unto the nine kings of Elam, how he killed them and exterminated their armies, though he had but few men with him? Or hast thou not heard what my two sons Simon and Levi did to the eight cities of the Amorites, which they destroyed on account of their sister Dinah? Benjamin consoled them for the loss of Joseph. What, then, will they do unto him that stretcheth forth the hand of power to snatch him away from them? \"Knowest thou not, O king of Egypt, that the might of our God is with us, and that He always hearkens unto our prayers, and never forsakes us? Had I called upon God to rise up against thee when my sons told me how thou didst act toward them, thou and thy people, ye all would have been annihilated ere Benjamin could come down to thee. But I reflected that Simon my son was abiding in thy house, and perhaps thou wast doing kindnesses unto him, and therefore I invoked not the punishment of God upon thee. Now my son Benjamin goeth down unto thee with my other sons. Take heed unto thyself, keep thy eyes directed upon him, and God will direct His eye upon all thy kingdom. \"I have said all now that is in my heart. My sons take their youngest brother down into Egypt with them, and do thou send them all back to me in peace.\" This letter Jacob put into the keeping of Judah, charging him to deliver it to the ruler of Egypt. His last words to his sons were an admonition to take good care of Benjamin and not leave him out of their sight, either on the journey or after their arrival in Egypt. He bade farewell to them, and then turned in prayer to God, saying: \"O Lord of heaven and earth! Remember Thy covenant with our father Abraham. Remember also my father Isaac, and grant grace unto my sons, and deliver them not into the hands of the king of Egypt. O my God, do it for the sake of Thy mercy, redeem my sons and save them from the hands of the Egyptians, and restore their two brethren unto them.\" Also the women and the children in the house of Jacob prayed to God amid tears, and entreated Him to redeem their husbands and their fathers out of the hands of the king of Egypt.",

      "content": "Great was the joy of Joseph when his brethren stood before him and Benjamin was with them. In his youngest brother he saw the true counterpart of his father. He ordered his son Manasseh, the steward of his house, to bring the men into the palace, and make ready a meal for them. But he was to take care to prepare the meat dishes in the presence of the guests, so that they might see with their own eyes that the cattle had been slaughtered according to the ritual prescriptions, and the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh had been removed. The dinner to which Joseph invited his brethren was a Sabbath meal, for he observed the seventh day even before the revelation of the law. The sons of Jacob refused the invitation of the steward, and a scuffle ensued. While he tried to force them into the banqueting hall, they tried to force him out, for they feared it was but a ruse to get possession of them and their asses, on account of the money they had found in their sacks on their return from their first journey to Egypt. In their modesty they put the loss of their beasts upon the same level as the loss of their personal liberty. To the average man property is as precious as life itself. Standing at the door of Joseph's house, they spake to the steward, and said: \"We are in badly reduced circumstances. In our country we supported others, and now we depend upon thee to support us.\" After these introductory words, they offered him the money they had found in their sacks. The steward reassured them concerning the money, saying, \"However it may be, whether for the sake of your own merits, or for the sake of the merits of your fathers, God hath caused you to find a treasure, for the money ye paid for the corn came into my hand.\" Then he brought Simon out to them. Their brother looked like a leather bottle, so fat and rotund had he grown during his sojourn in Egypt. He told his brethren what kind treatment had been accorded unto him. The very moment they left the city he had been released from prison, and thereafter he had been entertained with splendor in the house of the ruler of Egypt. When Joseph made his appearance, Judah took Benjamin by the hand, and presented him to the viceroy, and they all bowed down themselves to him to the earth. Joseph asked them concerning the welfare of their father and their grandfather, and they made reply, \"Thy servant our father is well; he is yet alive,\" and Joseph knew from their words that his grandfather Isaac was no more. He had died at the time when Joseph was released from prison, and the joy of God in the liberation of Joseph was overcast by His sorrow for Isaac. Then Judah handed his father's letter to Joseph, who was so moved at seeing the well-known handwriting that he had to retire to his chamber and weep. When he came back, he summoned Benjamin to approach close to him, and he laid his hand upon his youngest brother's head, and blessed him with the words, \"God be gracious unto thee, my son.\" His father had once mentioned \"the children which God hath graciously given Thy servant,\" and as Benjamin was not among the children thus spoken of, for he was born later, Joseph compensated him now by blessing him with the grace of God. The table was set in three divisions, for Joseph, for his brethren, and for the Egyptians. The sons of Jacob did not venture to eat of the dishes set before them, they were afraid they might not have been prepared according to the ritual prescriptions—a punishment upon Joseph for having slandered his brethren, whom he once charged with not being punctilious in the observance of the dietary laws. The Egyptians, again, could not sit at the same table with the sons of Jacob, because the latter ate the flesh of the animals to which the former paid divine worship. When all was ready, and the guests were to be seated, Joseph raised his cup, and, pretending to inhale his knowledge from it, he said, \"Judah is king, therefore let him sit at the head of the table, and let Reuben the first-born take the second seat,\" and thus he assigned places to all his brethren corresponding to their dignity and their age. Moreover, he seated the brothers together who were the sons of the same mother, and when he reached Benjamin, he said, \"I know that the youngest among you has no brother borne by his own mother, next to whom he might be seated, and also I have none, therefore he may take his place next to me.\" The brethren marvelled one with another at all this. During the meal, Joseph took his portion, and gave it to Benjamin, and his wife Asenath followed his example, and also Ephraim and Manasseh, so that Benjamin had four portions in addition to that which he had received like the other sons of Jacob. Wine was served at the meal, and it was the first time in twenty-two years that Joseph and his brethren tasted of it, for they had led the life of Nazarites, his brethren because they regretted the evil they had done to Joseph, and Joseph because he grieved over the fate of his father. Joseph entered into conversation with his brother Benjamin. He asked him whether he had a brother borne by his own mother, and Benjamin answered, \"I had one, but I do not know what hath become of him.\" Joseph continued his questions: \"Hast thou a wife?\" Benjamin: \"Yes, I have a wife and ten sons.\" Joseph: \"And what are their names? \" Benjamin: \"Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.\" Joseph: \"Why didst thou give them such peculiar names?\" Benjamin: \"In memory of my brother and his sufferings: Bela, because my brother disappeared among the peoples; Becher, he was the first-born son of my mother; Ashbel, he was taken away from my father; Gera, he dwells a stranger in a strange land; Naaman, he was exceedingly lovely; Ehi, he was my only brother by my father and my mother together; Rosh, he was at the head of his brethren; Muppim, he was beautiful in every respect; Huppim, he was slandered; and Ard, because he was as beautiful as a rose.\" Joseph ordered his magic astrolabe to be brought to him, whereby he knew all things that happen, and he said unto Benjamin, \"I have heard that the Hebrews are acquainted with all wisdom, but dost thou know aught of this?\" Benjamin answered, \"Thy servant also is skilled in all wisdom, which my father hath taught me.\" He then looked upon the astrolabe, and to his great astonishment he discovered by the aid of it that he who was sitting upon the throne before him was his brother Joseph. Noticing Benjamin's amazement, Joseph asked him, \"What hast thou seen, and why art thou astonished?\" Benjamin said, \"I can see by this that Joseph my brother sitteth here before me upon the throne.\" And Joseph said: \"I am Joseph thy brother! Reveal not the thing unto our brethren. I will send thee with them when they go away, and I will command them to be brought back again into the city, and I will take thee away from them. If they risk their lives and fight for thee, then shall I know that they have repented of what they did unto me, and I will make myself known unto them. But if they forsake thee, I will keep thee, that thou shouldst remain with me. They shall go away, and I will not make myself known unto them.\" Then Joseph inquired of Benjamin what his brethren had told their father after they had sold him into slavery, and he heard the story of the coat dipped in the blood of a kid of the goats. \"Yes, brother,\" spoke Joseph, \"when they had stripped me of my coat, they handed me over to the Ishmaelites, who tied an apron around my waist, scourged me, and bade me run off. But a lion attacked the one that beat me, and killed him, and his companions were alarmed, and they sold me to other people.\" Dismissed by Joseph with kind words, his brethren started on their homeward journey as soon as the morning was light, for it is a good rule to \"leave a city after sunrise, and enter a city before sundown.\" Besides, Joseph had a specific reason for not letting his brethren depart from the city during the night. He feared an encounter between them and his servants, and that his men might get the worst of it, for the sons of Jacob were like the wild beasts, which have the upper hand at night.",

      "content": "They were not yet far beyond the city gates, when Joseph dispatched Manasseh, the steward of his house, to follow after them, and look for the silver cup that he had concealed in Benjamin's sack. He knew his brethren well, he did not venture to let them get too far from the city before he should attempt to force their return. He hoped that the nearness of the city would intimidate them and make them heed his commands. Manasseh therefore received the order to bring them to a halt, by mild speech if he could, or by rough speech if he must, and carry them back to the city. He acted according to his instructions. When the brethren heard the accusation of theft , they said: \"With whomsoever of thy servants the cup be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.\" And Manasseh said, \"As you say, so were it proper to do, for if ten persons are charged with theft, and the stolen object is found with one of them, all are held responsible. But I will not be so hard. He with whom the cup is found shall be the bondman, and the rest shall be blameless.\" He searched all the sacks, and in order not to excite the suspicion that he knew where the cup was, he began at Reuben, the eldest, and left off at Benjamin, the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. In a rage, his brethren shouted at Benjamin, \"O thou thief and son of a thief! Thy mother brought shame upon our father by her thievery, and now thou bringest shame upon us.\" But he replied, \"Is this matter as evil as the matter of the kid of the goats—as the deed of the brethren that sold their own brother into slavery?\" In their fury and vexation, the brethren rent their clothes. God paid them in their own coin. They had caused Jacob to tear his clothes in his grief over Joseph, and now they were made to do the same on account of their own troubles. And as they rent their clothes for the sake of their brother Benjamin, so Mordecai, the descendant of Benjamin, was destined to rend his on account of his brethren, the people of Israel. But because mortification was inflicted upon the brethren through Manasseh, the steward of Joseph, the allotment of territory given to the tribe of Manasseh was \"torn\" in two, one-half of the tribe had to live on one side of the Jordan, the other half on the other side. And Joseph, who had not shrunk from vexing his brethren so bitterly that they rent their clothes in their abasement, was punished, in that his descendant Joshua was driven to such despair after the defeat of Ai that he, too, rent his clothes. Convicted of theft beyond the peradventure of a doubt, the brethren of Joseph had no choice but to comply with the steward's command and return to the city. They accompanied him without delay. Each of them loaded his ass himself, raising the burden with one hand from the ground to the back of the beast, and then they retraced their steps cityward, and as they walked, they rapped Benjamin roughly on the shoulder, saying, \"O thou thief and son of a thief, thou hast brought the same shame upon us that thy mother brought upon our father.\" Benjamin bore the blows and the abusive words in patient silence, and he was rewarded for his humility. For submitting to the blows upon his shoulder, God appointed that His Shekinah should \"dwell between his shoulders,\" and He also called him \"the beloved of the Lord.\" Joseph's brethren returned to the city without fear. Though it was a great metropolis, in their eyes it appeared but as a hamlet of ten persons, which they could wipe out with a turn of the hand. They were led into the presence of Joseph, who, contrary to his usual habit, was not holding a session of the court in the forum on that day. He remained at home, that his brethren might not be exposed to shame in public. They fell to the earth before him, and thus came true his dream of the eleven stars that made obeisance to him. But even while paying homage to Joseph, Judah was boiling inwardly with suppressed rage, and he said to his brethren, \"Verily, this man hath forced me to come back hither only that I should destroy the city on this day.\" Guarded by his valiant men on the right and on the left, Joseph addressed his brethren, snarling, \"What deed is this that ye have done, to steal away my cup? I know well, ye took it in order to discover with its help the whereabouts of your brother that hath disappeared.\" Judah was spokesman, and he replied: \"What shall we say unto my lord concerning the first money that he found in the mouth of our sacks? What shall we speak concerning the second money that also was in our sacks? And how shall we clear ourselves concerning the cup? We cannot acknowledge ourselves guilty, for we know ourselves to be innocent in all these matters. Yet we cannot avow ourselves innocent, because God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants, like a creditor that goes about and tries to collect a debt owing to him. Two brothers take care not to enter a house of mirth and festivity together, that they be not exposed to the evil eye, but we all were caught together in one place, by reason of the sin which we committed in company.\" Joseph: \"But if your punishment is for selling Joseph, why should this brother of yours suffer, the youngest, he that had no part in your crime. Judah: \"A thief and his companions are taken together.\" Joseph: \"If you could prevail upon yourselves to report to your father concerning a brother that had not stolen, and had brought no manner of shame upon you, that a wild beast had torn him, you will easily persuade yourselves to say it concerning a brother that hath stolen, and hath brought shame upon you. Go hence, and tell your father, 'The rope follows after the water bucket.' But,\" continued Joseph, shaking his purple mantle, \"God forbid that I should accuse you all of theft. Only the youth that stole the cup in order to divine his brother's whereabouts shall remain with me as my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.\" The holy spirit called out, \"Great peace have they which love thy law!\" The brethren all consented to yield Benjamin to the ruler of Egypt, only Judah demurred, and he cried out, \"Now it is all over with peace!\" and he prepared to use force, if need be, to rescue Benjamin from slavery.",

      "content": "Joseph dismissed his brethren, and carried Benjamin off by main force, and locked him up in a chamber. But Judah broke the door open and stood before Joseph with his brethren. He determined to use in turn the three means of liberating Benjamin at his disposal. He was prepared to convince Joseph by argument, or move him by entreaties, or resort to force, in order to accomplish his end. He spake: \"Thou doest a wrong unto us. Thou who didst say, 'I fear God,' thou showest thyself to be like unto Pharaoh, who hath no fear of God. The judgments which thou dost pronounce are not in accordance with our laws, nor are they in accordance with the laws of the nations. According to our law, a thief must pay double the value of what he hath stolen. Only, if he hath no money, he is sold into slavery, but if he hath the money, he maketh double restitution. And according to the law of the nations, the thief is deprived of all he owns. Do so, but let him go free. If a man buys a slave, and then discovers him to be a thief, the transaction is void. Yet thou desirest to make one a slave whom thou chargest with being a thief. I suspect thee of wanting to keep him in thy power for illicit purposes, and in this lustfulness thou resemblest Pharaoh. Also thou art like Pharaoh in that thou makest a promise and keepest it not. Thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring thy youngest brother down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. Dost thou call this setting thine eyes upon him? If thou didst desire nothing beside a slave, then wouldst thou surely accept our offer to serve thee as bondmen instead of Benjamin. Reuben is older than he, and I exceed him in strength. It cannot but be as I say, thou hast a lustful purpose in mind with our brother. \"Therefore let these words of mine which I am about to speak find entrance into thy heart: For the sake of the grandmother of this lad were Pharaoh and his house stricken with sore plagues, because he detained her in his palace a single night against her will. His mother died a premature death, by reason of a curse which his father uttered in inconsiderate haste. Take heed, then, that this man's curse strike thee not and slay thee. Two of us destroyed the whole of a city on account of one woman, how much more would we do it for the sake of a man, and that man the beloved of the Lord, in whose allotment it is appointed that God shall dwell! \"If I but utter a sound, death-dealing pestilence will stalk through the land as far as No. In this land Pharaoh is the first, and thou art the second after him, but in our land my father is the first, and I am the second. If thou wilt not comply with our demand, I will draw my sword, and hew thee down first, and then Pharaoh.\" When Judah gave utterance to this threat, Joseph made a sign, and Manasseh stamped his foot on the ground so that the whole palace shook. Judah said, \"Only one belonging to our family can stamp thus!\" and intimidated by this display of great strength, he moderated his tone and manner. \"From the very beginning,\" he continued to speak, \"thou didst resort to all sorts of pretexts in order to embarrass us. The inhabitants of many countries came down into Egypt to buy corn, but none of them didst thou ask questions about their family relations. In sooth, we did not come hither to seek thy daughter in marriage, or peradventure thou desirest an alliance with our sister? Nevertheless we gave thee an answer unto all thy questions.\" Joseph replied: \"Verily, thou canst talk glibly! Is there another babbler like thee among thy brethren? Why dost thou speak so much, while thy brethren that are older than thou, Reuben, Simon, and Levi, stand by silent?\" Judah: \"None of my brethren has so much at stake as I have, if Benjamin returns not to his father. I was a surety to my father for him, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame forever, in this world and in the world to come. The other brethren withheld themselves intentionally from taking part in the dispute between Judah and Joseph, saying, \"Kings are carrying on a dispute, and it is not seemly for us to interfere between them.\" Even the angels descended from heaven to earth to be spectators of the combat between Joseph the bull and Judah the lion, and they said, \"It lies in the natural course of things that the bull should fear the lion, but here the two are engaged in equal, furious combat.\" In reply to Judah, when he explained that his great interest in Benjamin's safety was due to the pledge he had given to his father, Joseph spoke: \"Why wast thou not a surety for thy other brother, when ye sold him for twenty pieces of silver? Then thou didst not regard the sorrow thou wast inflicting upon thy father, but thou didst say, A wild beast hath devoured Joseph. And yet Joseph had done no evil, while this Benjamin has committed theft. Therefore, go up and say unto thy father, The rope hath followed after the water bucket.\" These words had such an effect upon Judah that he broke out in sobs, and cried aloud, \"How shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me?\" His outcry reached to a distance of four hundred parasangs, and when Hushim the son of Dan heard it in Canaan, he jumped into Egypt with a single leap and joined his voice with Judah's, and the whole land was on the point of collapsing from the great noise they produced. Joseph's valiant men lost their teeth, and the cities of Pithom and Raamses were destroyed, and they remained in ruins until the Israelites built them up again under taskmasters. Also Judah's brethren, who had kept quiet up to that moment, fell into a rage, and stamped on the ground with their feet until it looked as though deep furrows had been torn in it by a ploughshare. And Judah addressed his brethren, \"Be brave, demean yourselves as men, and let each one of you show his heroism, for the circumstances demand that we do our best.\" Then they resolved to destroy Mizraim, the city of Egypt, and Judah said, \"I will raise my voice, and with it destroy Egypt.\" Reuben: \"I will raise my arm, and crush it out of existence.\" Simon: \"I will raise my hand, and lay waste its palaces.\" Levi: \"I will draw my sword, and slay the inhabitants of Egypt.\" Issachar: \"I will make the land like unto Sodom.\" Zebulon: \"Like unto Gomorrah will I render it.\" Dan: \"I will reduce it to a desert.\" Then Judah's towering rage began to show signs of breaking out: his right eye shed tears of blood; the hair above his heart grew so stiff that it pierced and rent the five garments in which he was clothed; and he took brass rods, bit them with his teeth, and spat them out as fine powder. When Joseph observed these signs, fear befell him, and in order to show that he, too, was a man of extraordinary strength, he pushed with his foot against the marble pedestal upon which he sat, and it broke into splinters. Judah exclaimed, \"This one is a hero equal to myself!\" Then he tried to draw his sword from its scabbard in order to slay Joseph, but the weapon could not be made to budge, and Judah was convinced thereby that his adversary was a God-fearing man, and he addressed himself to the task of begging him to let Benjamin go free, but he remained inexorable. Judah then said: \"What shall we say unto our father, when he seeth that our brother is not with us, and he will grieve over him?\" Joseph: \"Say that the rope hath followed after the water bucket.\" Judah: \"Thou art a king, why dost thou speak in this wise, counselling a falsehood? Woe unto the king that is like thee!\" Joseph: \"Is there a greater falsehood than that ye spake concerning your brother Joseph, whom you sold to the Midianites for twenty pieces of silver, telling your father, An evil beast bath devoured him?\" Judah: \"The fire of Shechem burneth in my heart, now will I burn all thy land with fire.\" Joseph: \"Surely, the fire kindled to burn Tamar, thy daughter-in-law, who did kill thy sons, will extinguish the fire of Shechem.\" Judah: \"If I pluck out a single hair from my body, I will fill the whole of Egypt with its blood.\" Joseph: \"Such is it your custom to do; thus ye did unto your brother whom you sold, and then you dipped his coat in blood, brought it to your father, and said, An evil beast hath devoured him, and here is his blood.\" When Judah heard this, he was exceedingly wroth, and he took a stone weighing four hundred shekels that was before him, cast it toward heaven with one hand, caught it with his left hand, then sat upon it, and the stone turned into dust. At the command of Joseph, Manasseh did likewise with another stone, and Joseph said to Judah: \"Strength hath not been given to you alone, we also are powerful men. Why, then, will ye all boast before us?\" Then Judah sent Naphtali forth, saying, \"Go and count all the streets of the city of Egypt and come and tell me the number,\" but Simon interposed, saying, \"Let not this thing trouble you, I will go to the mount, and take up one huge stone from the mount, throw it over the whole of Mizraim, the city of Egypt, and kill all therein.\" Hearing all these words, which they spake aloud, because they did not know that he understood Hebrew, Joseph bade his son Manasseh make haste and gather together all the inhabitants of Egypt, and all the valiant men, and let them come to him on horseback and afoot. Meantime Naphtali had gone quickly to execute Judah's bidding, for he was as swift as the nimble hart, he could run across a field of corn without breaking an ear. And he returned and reported that the city of Egypt was divided into twelve quarters. Judah bade his brethren destroy the city; he himself undertook to raze three quarters, and he assigned the nine remaining quarters to the others, one quarter to each. In the meantime Manasseh had assembled a great army, five hundred mounted men and ten thousand on foot, among them four hundred valiant heroes, who could fight without spear or sword, using only their strong, unarmed hands. To inspire his brethren with more terror, Joseph ordered them to make a loud noise with all sorts of instruments, and their appearance and the hubbub they produced did, indeed, cause fear to fall upon some of the brethren of Joseph. Judah, however, called to them, \"Why are you terrified, seeing that God grants us His mercy?\" He drew his sword, and uttered a wild cry, which threw all the people into consternation, and in their disordered flight many fell over each other and perished, and Judah and his brethren followed after the fleeing people as far as the house of Pharaoh. Returning to Joseph, Judah again broke out in loud roars, and the reverberations caused by his cries were so mighty that all the city walls in Egypt and in Goshen fell in ruins, the pregnant women brought forth untimely births, and Pharaoh was flung from his throne. Judah's cries were heard at a great distance, as far off as Succoth. When Pharaoh learnt the reason of the mighty uproar, he sent word to Joseph that he would have to concede the demands of the Hebrews, else the land would suffer destruction. \"Thou canst take thy choice,\" were the words of Pharaoh, \"between me and the Hebrews, between Egypt and the land of the Hebrews. If thou wilt not heed my command, then leave me and go with them into their land.\"",

      "title": "Joseph Makes Himself Known",
      "content": "Seeing that his brethren were, indeed, on the point of destroying Egypt, Joseph resolved to make himself known to them, and he cast around for a proper opening, which would lead naturally to his announcement. At his behest, Manasseh laid his hand upon Judah's shoulder, and his touch allayed Judah's fury, for he noticed that he was in contact with a kinsman of his, because such strength existed in no other family. Then Joseph addressed Judah gently, saying: \"I should like to know who advised him to steal the cup. Could it have been one of you?\" Benjamin replied: \"Neither did they counsel theft, nor did I touch the cup.\" \"Take an oath upon it,\" demanded Joseph, and Benjamin complied with his brother's request: \"I swear that I did not touch the cup! As true as my brother Joseph is separated from me; as true as I had nothing to do with the darts that my brethren threw at him; as true as I was not one of those to take off his coat; as true as I had no part in the transaction by which he was given over to the Ishmaelites; as true as I did not help the others dip his coat in blood; so true is my oath, that they did not counsel theft, and that I did not commit theft.\" Joseph: \"How can I know that this oath of thine taken upon thy brother's fate is true?\" Benjamin: \"From the names of my ten sons, which I gave them in memory of my brother's life and trials, thou canst see how dearly I loved him. I pray thee, therefore, do not bring down my father with sorrow to the grave.\" Hearing these words of abiding love, Joseph could refrain himself no longer. He could not but make himself known unto his brethren. He spake these words to them: \"Ye said the brother of this lad was dead. Did you yourselves see him dead before you?\" They answered, \"Yes!\" Joseph: \"Did you stand beside his grave?\" The brethren: \"Yes!\" Joseph: \"Did you throw clods of earth upon his corpse?\" The brethren: \"No.\" Then Joseph reflected, saying to himself: \"My brethren are as pious as aforetime, and they speak no lies. They said I was dead, because when they abandoned me, I was poor, and 'a poor man is like unto a dead man;' they stood beside my grave, that is the pit into which they cast me; but they did not say that they had shovelled earth upon me, for that would have been a falsehood.\" Turning to his brethren, he said: \"Ye lie when ye say that your brother is dead. He is not dead. You sold him, and I did buy him. I shall call him, and set him before your eyes,\" and he began to call, \"Joseph, son of Jacob, come hither! Joseph, son of Jacob, come hither! Speak to thy brethren who did sell thee.\" The others turned their eyes hither and thither, to the four corners of the house, until Joseph called to them: \"Why look ye here and there? Behold, I am Joseph your brother! \"Their souls fled away from them, and they could make no answer, but God permitted a miracle to happen, and their souls came back to them. Joseph continued, \"Ye see it with your own eyes, and also my brother Benjamin seeth it with his eyes, that I speak with you in Hebrew, and I am truly your brother.\" But they would not believe him. Not only had he been transformed from a smooth-faced youth into a bearded man since they had abandoned him, but also the forsaken youth now stood before them the ruler of Egypt. Therefore Joseph bared his body and showed them that he belonged to the descendants of Abraham. Abashed they stood there, and in their rage they desired to slay Joseph as the author of their shame and their suffering. But an angel appeared and flung them to the four corners of the house. Judah raised so loud an outcry that the walls of the city of Egypt tumbled down, the women brought forth untimely births, Joseph and Pharaoh both rolled down off their thrones, and Joseph's three hundred heroes lost their teeth, and their heads remained forever immobile, facing backward, as they had turned them to discover the cause of the tumult. Yet the brethren did not venture to approach close to Joseph, they were too greatly ashamed of their behavior toward their brother. He sought to calm them, saying, \"Now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither, for God did send me before you to preserve life.\" Even such kind words of exhortation did not banish their fear, and Joseph continued to speak, \"As little as I harbor vengeful thoughts in my heart against Benjamin, so little do I harbor them against you.\"And still his brethren were ill at case, and Joseph went on, \"Think you that it is possible for me to inflict harm upon you? If the smoke of ten candles could not extinguish one, how can one extinguish ten?\" At last the brethren were soothed, and they went up to Joseph, who knew each by name, and, weeping, he embraced and kissed them all in turn. The reason why he wept was that his prophetic spirit showed him the descendants of his brethren enslaved by the nations. Especially did he weep upon Benjamin's neck, because he foresaw the destruction decreed for the two Temples to be situated in the allotment of Benjamin. And Benjamin also wept upon Joseph's neck, for the sanctuary at Shiloh, in the territory of Joseph which was likewise doomed to destruction. Pharaoh was well pleased with the report of the reconciliation between Joseph and the Hebrews, for he had feared that their dissensions might cause the ruin of Egypt, and he sent his servants to Joseph, that they take part in his joy. Also he sent word to Joseph that it would please him well if his brethren took up their abode in Egypt, and he promised to assign the best parts of the land to them for their dwelling-place. Not all the servants of Pharaoh were in agreement with their master concerning this invitation to the Hebrews. Many among them were disquieted, saying, \"If one of the sons of Jacob came hither, and he was advanced to a high position over our heads, what evil will happen to us when ten more come hither?\" Joseph gave all his brethren two changes of raiment, one for use on the ordinary days of the week and one for use on the Sabbath, for, when the cup was found with Benjamin, they had rent their clothes, and Joseph would not have his brethren go about in torn garments. But to Benjamin he gave five changes of raiment, though not in order to distinguish him above his brethren. Joseph remembered only too well what mischief his father had caused by giving him the coat of many colors, thereby arousing the envy of his brethren. He desired only to intimate that Mordecai, a descendant of Benjamin, would once be arrayed in five royal garments. Joseph presented his brethren, apparelled in their gold and silver embroidered clothes, before Pharaoh, who was well pleased to become acquainted with them when he saw that they were men of heroic stature and handsome appearance. He gave them wagons, to bring their families down into Egypt, but as they were ornamented with images of idols, Judah burnt them, and Joseph replaced them with eleven other wagons, among them the one he had ridden in at his accession to office, to view the land of Egypt. This was to be used by his father on his journey to Egypt. For each of his brothers' children, he sent raiments, and also one hundred pieces of silver for each, but for each of the children of Benjamin he sent ten changes of raiment. And for the wives of his brethren he gave them rich garments of state, such as were worn by the wives of the Pharaohs, and also ointments and aromatic spices. To his sister Dinah he sent silver and gold embroidered clothes, and myrrh, aloes, and other perfumes, and such presents he gave also to the wife and the daughters-in-law of Benjamin. For themselves and for their wives the brethren received all sorts of precious stones and jewelled ornaments, like those that are worn by the Egyptian nobility. Joseph accompanied his eleven brethren to the frontier, and there he took leave of them with the wish that they and all their families come down to Egypt, and he enjoined upon them, besides, three maxims to be observed by travellers: Do not take too large steps; do not discuss Halakic subjects, that you lose not your way; and enter the city at the latest with the going down of the sun.",

      "content": "In blithe spirits the sons of Jacob journeyed up to the land of Canaan, but when they reached the boundary line, they said to one another, \"How shall we do? If we appear before our father and tell him that Joseph is alive, he will be greatly frightened, and he will not be inclined to believe us.\" Besides, Joseph's last injunction to them had been to take heed and not startle their father with the tidings of joy. On coming close to their habitation, they caught sight of Serah, the daughter of Asher, a very beautiful maiden, and very wise, who was skilled in playing upon the harp. They summoned her unto them and gave her a harp, and bade her play before Jacob and sing that which they should tell her. She sat down before Jacob, and, with an agreeable melody, she sang the following words, accompanying herself upon the harp: \"Joseph, my uncle, liveth, he ruleth over the whole of Egypt, he is not dead!\" She repeated these words several times, and Jacob grew more and more pleasurably excited. His joy awakened the holy spirit in him, and he knew that she spoke the truth. The spirit of prophecy never visits a seer when he is in a state of lassitude or in a state of grief; it comes only together with joy. All the years of Joseph's separation from him Jacob had had no prophetic visions, because he was always sad, and only when Serah's words reawakened the feeling of happiness in his heart, the prophetic spirit again took possession of him. Jacob rewarded her therefor with the words, \"My daughter, may death never have power over thee, for thou didst revive my spirit.\" And so it was. Serah did not die, she entered Paradise alive. At his bidding, she repeated the words she had sung again and again, and they gave Jacob great joy and delight, so that the holy spirit waxed stronger and stronger within him. While he was sitting thus in converse with Serah, his sons appeared arrayed in all their magnificence, and with all the presents that Joseph had given them, and they spake to Jacob, saying: \"Glad tidings! Joseph our brother liveth! He is ruler over the whole land of Egypt, and he sends thee a message of joy.\" At first Jacob would not believe them, but when they opened their packs, and showed him the presents Joseph had sent to all, he could not doubt the truth of their words any longer. Joseph had had a premonition that his father would refuse to give his brethren credence, because they had tried to deceive him before, and \"it is the punishment of the liar that his words are not believed even when he speaks the truth.\" He had therefore said to them, \"If my father will not believe your words, tell him that when I took leave of him, to see whether it was well with you, he had been teaching me the law of the heifer whose neck is broken in the valley.\" When they repeated this, every last vestige of Jacob's doubt disappeared, and he said: \"Great is the steadfastness of my son Joseph. In spite of all his sufferings he has remained constant in his piety. Yea, great are the benefits that the Lord hath conferred upon me. He saved me from the hands of Esau, and from the hands of Laban, and from the Canaanites who pursued after me. I have tasted many joys, and I hope to see more, but never did I hope to set eyes upon Joseph again, and now I shall go down to him and behold him before my death.\" Then Jacob and the members of his family put on the clothes Joseph had sent, among them a turban for Jacob, and they made all preparations to journey down into Egypt and dwell there with Joseph and his family. Hearing of his good fortune, the kings and the grandees of Canaan came to wait upon Jacob and express sympathy with him in his joy, and he prepared a three days' banquet for them. Jacob, however, would not go down into Egypt without first inquiring whether it was the will of God that he should leave the Holy Land. He said, \"How can I leave the land of my fathers, the land of my birth, the land in which the Shekinah dwells, and go into an unclean land, inhabited by slaves of the sons of Ham, a land wherein there is no fear of God?\" Then he brought sacrifices in honor of God, in the expectation that a Divine vision would descend upon him and instruct him whether to go down into Egypt or have Joseph come up to Canaan. He feared the sojourn in Egypt, for he remembered the vision he had had at Beth-el on leaving his father's house, and he said to God: \"I resemble my father. As he was greedy in filling his maw, so am I, and therefore I would go down into Egypt in consequence of the famine. As my father preferred one son to the other, so had I a favorite son, and therefore I would go down into Egypt to see Joseph. But in this I do not resemble my father, he had only himself to provide for, and my house consists of seventy souls, and therefore am I compelled to go down into Egypt. The blessing which my father gave me was not fulfilled in me, but in my son Joseph, whom peoples serve, and before whom nations bow down.\" Then the Shekinah addressed Jacob, calling his name twice in token of love, and bidding him not to fear the Egyptian slavery foretold for the descendants of Abraham, for God would have pity upon the suffering of his children and deliver them from bondage. God furthermore said, \"I will go down into Egypt with thee,\" and the Shekinah accompanied Jacob thither, bringing the number of the company with which he entered Egypt up to seventy. But as Jacob entertained fears that his descendants would stay there forever, God gave him the assurance that He would lead him forth together with all the pious that were like unto him. And God also told Jacob that Joseph had remained steadfast in his piety even in Egypt, and he might dismiss all doubts from his mind on this score, for it was his anxiety on this account that had induced Jacob to consider going down into Egypt; he wanted only to make sure of Joseph's faithfulness, and then return home, but God commanded him to go thither and remain there. Before Jacob left Canaan, he went to Beer-sheba, to hew down the cedars that Abraham had planted there, and take them with him to Egypt. For centuries these cedar trees remained in the possession of his descendants; they carried them with them when they left Egypt, and they used them in building the Tabernacle. Although Joseph had put wagons at the disposal of his brethren for the removal of his family from Canaan to Egypt, they yet carried Jacob upon their arms, for which purpose they divided themselves into three divisions, one division after the other assuming the burden. As a reward for their filial devotion, God redeemed their descendants from Egypt. Judah was sent on ahead by his father, to erect a dwelling in Goshen, and also a Bet ha-Midrash, that Jacob might set about instructing his sons at once after his arrival. He charged Judah with this honorable task in order to compensate him for a wrong he had done him. All the years of Joseph's absence he bad suspected Judah of having made away with Rachel's son. How little the suspicion was justified he realized now when Judah in particular had been assiduous in securing the safety of Benjamin, the other son of Rachel. Jacob therefore said to Judah: \"Thou hast done a pious, God-bidden deed, and hast shown thyself to be a man capable of carrying on negotiations with Joseph. Complete the work thou hast begun! Go to Goshen, and together with Joseph prepare all things for our coming. Indeed,\" continued Jacob, \"thou wast the cause of our going down into Egypt, for it was at thy suggestion that Joseph was sold as a slave, and, also, through thy descendants Israel will be led forth out of Egypt.\" When Joseph was informed of the approach of his father, he rejoiced exceedingly, chiefly because his coming would stop the talk of the Egyptians, who were constantly referring to him as the slave that had dominion over them. \"Now,\" thought Joseph, \"they will see my father and my brethren, and they will be convinced that I am a free-born man, of noble stock.\" In his joy in anticipation of seeing his father, Joseph made ready his chariot with his own hands, without waiting for his servants to minister to him, and this loving action redounded later to the benefit of the Israelites, for it rendered of none effect Pharaoh's zeal in making ready his chariot himself, with his own hands, to pursue after the Israelites.",

      "content": "When the Egyptian nobles observed their viceroy completing his preparations to meet his father, they did the same. Indeed, Joseph had issued a proclamation throughout the land, threatening with death all that did not go forth to meet Jacob. The procession that accompanied him was composed of countless men, arrayed in byssus and purple, and marching to the sound of all sorts of musical instruments. Even the women of Egypt had a part in the reception ceremonies. They ascended to the roofs of the houses and the walls of the cities, ready to greet Jacob with the music of cymbals and timbrels. Joseph wore the royal crown upon his head, Pharaoh had yielded it to him for the occasion. He descended from his chariot when he was at a distance of about fifty ells from his father, and walked the rest of the way on foot, and his example was followed by the princes and nobles of Egypt. When Jacob caught sight of the approaching procession, he was rejoiced, and even before he recognized Joseph, he bowed down before him, but for permitting his father to show him this mark of honor, punishment was visited upon Joseph. He died an untimely death, before the years of life assigned to him had elapsed. That no harm befall Jacob from a too sudden meeting with him, Joseph sent his oldest son ahead with five horses, the second son following close after him in the same way. As each son approached, Jacob thought he beheld Joseph, and so he was prepared gradually to see him face to face. Meantime Jacob had espied, from where he was seated, a man in royal robes among the Egyptians, a crown upon his head, and a purple mantle over his shoulders, and he asked Judah who it might be. When he was told that it was Joseph, his joy was great over the high dignity attained by his son. By this time Joseph had come close to his father, and he bowed himself before him down to the earth, and all the people with him likewise prostrated themselves. Then Joseph fell upon his father's neck, and he wept bitterly. He was particularly grieved that he had permitted his father to bow down before him but a little while before without hindering it. At the very moment when Joseph embraced his father, Jacob was reciting the Shema', and he did not allow himself to be interrupted in his prayer, but then he said, \"When they brought me the report of the death of Joseph, I thought I was doomed to double death—that I should lose this world and the world to come as well. The Lord had promised to make me the ancestor of twelve tribes, and as the death of my son rendered it impossible that this promise should be realized, I feared I had incurred the doom by my own sins, and as a sinner I could not but expect to forfeit the future world, too. But now that I have beheld thee alive, I know that my death will be only for the world here below.\" Such was the manner of Jacob's arrival in Egypt. He came with his whole family, sixty-nine persons they were in all, but the number was raised to seventy by the birth of Jochebed, afterward the mother of Moses, which took place when the cavalcade had advanced to the space between the one and the other city wall. All the males in his family were married men; even Pallu and Hezron, the latter of whom was but one year old at the time of their migration, and the former but two years, had the wives with them that had been chosen for them by their parents. In general, all the sons and grandsons of Jacob had married young, some of them had been fathers at the age of seven. Joseph took some from among his brethren, and presented them to Pharaoh. He chose the weakest of them, that the king might not be tempted to retain them in his service as warriors. And as he did not desire his family to live at close quarters with the Egyptians and perhaps amalgamate with them, he introduced them as shepherds. The Egyptians worshipped the constellation of the rain, and paid divine honors to animals, and they kept aloof from shepherds. Pharaoh therefore was inclined to grant Joseph's wish, to give them the pasture land of Goshen for their sojourning place, the land that was theirs by right, for the Pharaoh that took Sarah away from Abraham by force had given it to her as her irrevocable possession. In their conversation with Pharaoh the brethren of Joseph made it plain to the Egyptian king that it was not their intention to remain in Egypt forever, it was to be only a temporary dwelling-place. Then Joseph set Jacob his father before Pharaoh, and when the king saw him, he said to Og, who happened to be with him at that moment, \"Seest thou! Thou wast wont to call Abraham a sterile mule, and here is his grandson with a family of seventy persons!\" Og would not believe his own eyes, he thought Abraham was standing before him, so close was the resemblance between Jacob and his progenitor. Then Pharaoh asked about Jacob's age, to find out whether he actually was Jacob, and not Abraham. And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, \"The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years,\" using the word pilgrimage in reference to life on earth, which the pious regard as a temporary sojourn in alien lands. \"Few and evil,\" he continued, \"have been the days of the years of my life. In my youth I had to flee to a strange land on account of my brother Esau, and now, in my old age, I must again go to a strange land, and my days have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.\" These words sufficed to convince Pharaoh and Og that the man standing before them was not Abraham, but his grandson. When Jacob uttered the words, \"The days of the years of my pilgrimage have been few and evil,\" God said to him: \"Jacob, I saved thee out of the hands of Esau and Laban, I restored Joseph unto thee, and made him to be a king and a ruler, and yet thou speakest of few and evil days. Because of thy ingratitude, thou wilt not attain unto the days of the years of the life of thy fathers,\" and Jacob died at an age thirty-three years less than his father Isaac's. On going out from the presence of Pharaoh, Jacob blessed the king with the words, \"May the years still in store for me be given unto thee, and may the Nile overflow its banks henceforth again and water the land.\" His words were fulfilled. In order to show that the pious are a blessing for the world, God caused the Nile to rise above its bed and fructify the land of Egypt.",

      "title": "Joseph's Kindness And Generosity",
      "content": "Jacob and his family now settled in the land of Goshen, and Joseph provided them with all things needful, not only with food and drink, but also with clothing, and in his love and kindness he entertained his father and his brethren daily at his own table. He banished the wrong done to him by his brethren from his mind, and he besought his father to pray to God for them, that He should forgive their great transgression. Touched by this noble sign of love, Jacob cried out, \"O Joseph, my child, thou hast conquered the heart of thy father Jacob.\" Joseph had other virtues, besides. The title \"the Godfearing one,\" borne only by him, Abraham, Job, and Obadiah, he gained by reason of his kindness of heart and his generosity. Whatever he gave his brethren, he gave with a \"good eye,\" a liberal spirit. If it was bread for food, it was sure to be abundant enough, not only to satisfy the hunger of all, but also for the children to crumble, as is their habit. But Joseph was more than a helper to his family. As a shepherd pastures his flock, so he provided for the whole world during the years of famine. The people cursed Pharaoh, who kept the stores of corn in his treasure chambers for his own use, and they blessed Joseph, who took thought for the famishing, and sold grain to all that came. The wealth which he acquired by these sales was lawful gain, for the prices were raised, not by him, but by the Egyptians themselves. One part of his possessions, consisting of gold and silver and precious stones, Joseph buried in four different places, in the desert near the Red Sea, on the banks of the Euphrates, and in two spots in the desert in the vicinity of Persia and Media. Korah discovered one of the hidingplaces, and the Roman emperor Antoninus, the son of Severus, another. The other two will never be found, because God has reserved the riches they hold for the pious, to be enjoyed by them in the latter days, the days of the Messiah. The remainder of Joseph's possessions he gave away, partly to his brethren and their families, and partly to Pharaoh, who put them into his treasury. The wealth of the whole world flowed into Egypt at that time, and it remained there until the exodus of the Israelites. They took it along, leaving Egypt like a net without fish. The Israelites kept the treasure until the time of Rehoboam, who was deprived of it by the Egyptian king Shishak, and he in turn had to yield it to Zerah, the king of Ethiopia. Once more it came into possession of the Jews when King Asa conquered Zerah, but this time they held it for only a short while, for Asa surrendered it to the Aramean king Ben-hadad, to induce him to break his league with Baasha, the king of the Ten Tribes. The Ammonites, in turn, captured it from Ben-hadad, only to lose it in their war with the Jews under Jehoshaphat. Again it remained with the Jews, until the time of King Ahaz, who sent it to Sennacherib as tribute money. Hezekiah won it back, but Zedekiah, the last king of the Jews, lost it to the Chaldeans, from whom it came to Persia, thence to the Greeks, and finally to the Romans, and with the last it remained for all time. The people were soon left without means to purchase the corn they needed. In a short time they had to part with their cattle, and when the money thus secured was spent, they sold their land to Joseph, and even their persons. Many of them would cover themselves with clay and appear before Joseph, and say to him, \"O lord king, see me and see my possessions!\" And so Joseph bought all the land of Egypt, and the inhabitants became his tenants, and they gave a fifth of their ingatherings unto joseph. The only class of the people permitted to remain in possession of their land were the priests. Joseph owed them gratitude, for they had made it possible for him to become the ruler over Egypt. The Egyptians had hesitated to make him their viceroy, because they shrank from choosing a man accused of adultery for so high an office. It was the priests that made the suggestion to examine Joseph's torn garment, which his mistress had submitted as evidence of his guilt, and see whether the rent was in front or in back. If it was in back, it would show his innocence—he had turned to flee, and his temptress had clutched him so that the garment tore. But if the tear was in front, then it would be a proof of his guilt—he had used violence with the woman, and she had torn the mantle in her efforts to defend her honor. The angel Gabriel came and transferred the rent from the fore part to the back, and the Egyptians were convinced of Joseph's innocence, and their scruples about raising him to the kingship were removed. As soon as the Egyptians learnt of the advantageous position of the priests, they all tried to prove themselves members of the caste. But Joseph investigated the lists in the archives, and determined the estate of every citizen. The priests were favored in another way. Beside remaining in possession of their land, they received daily portions from Pharaoh, wherefore God said, \"The priests that serve idols receive all they need every day, how much more do the sons of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are My priests, deserve that I should give them what they need every day.\" The rest of the inhabitants of Egypt, who had to part with their land, were not permitted to remain in their native provinces. Joseph removed them from their own cities, and settled them in others. His purpose herein was to prevent the Egyptians from speaking of his brethren derogatorily as \"exiles the sons of exiles\"; he made them all equally aliens. For the same reason, God later, at the time of the going forth of the Israelites from Egypt, caused all nations to change their dwelling-places about, so that the Israelites could not be reproached with having had to leave their home. And, finally, when Sermacherib carried the Jews away from their land into exile, it also happened that this king first mixed up the inhabitants of all the countries of the world.",

      "id": "ginzberg-v2-jacob-s-last-wish",
      "title": "Jacob's Last Wish",
      "content": "In return for the seventeen years that Jacob had devoted to the bringing up of Joseph, he was granted seventeen years of sojourn with his favorite son in peace and happiness. The wicked experience sorrow after joy; the pious must suffer first, and then they are happy, for all's well that ends well, and God permits the pious to spend the last years of their lives in felicity. When Jacob felt his end approach, he summoned Joseph to his bedside, and he told him all there was in his heart. He called for Joseph rather than one of his other sons, because he was the only one in a position to execute his wishes. Jacob said to Joseph: \"If I have found grace in thy sight, bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt. Only for thy sake did I come down into Egypt, and for thy sake I spoke, Now I can die. Do this for me as a true service of love, and not because thou art afraid, or because decency demands it. And when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt bury me in their burying-place. Carry me out of the land of idolatry, and bury me in the land where God hath caused His Name to dwell, and put me to rest in the place in which four husbands and wives are to be buried, I the last of them.\" Jacob desired not to be buried in Egypt for several reasons. He knew that the soil of Egypt would once swarm with vermin, and it revolted him to think of his corpse exposed to such uncleanness. He feared, moreover, that his descendants might say, \"Were Egypt not a holy land, our father Jacob had never permitted himself to be buried there,\" and they might encourage themselves with this argument to make choice of Egypt as a permanent dwellingplace. Also, if his grave were there, the Egyptians might resort to it when the ten plagues came upon them, and if he were induced to pray for them to God, he would be advocating the cause of the Lord's enemies. If, on the other hand, he did not intercede for them, the Name of God would be profaned among the heathen, who would say, \"Jacob is a useless saint!\" Besides, it was possible that God might consider him, the \"scattered sheep\" of Israel, as a sacrifice for the Egyptians, and remit their punishment. From his knowledge of the people, another fear was justified, that his grave would become an object of idolatrous veneration, and the same punishment is appointed by God for the idols worshipped as for the idolaters that worship them. If Jacob had good reasons for not wanting his body to rest in the soil of Egypt, he had equally good reasons for wanting it to rest in the Holy Land. In the Messianic time, when the dead will rise, those buried in Palestine will awaken to new life without delay, while those buried elsewhere will first have to roll from land to land through the earth, hollowed out for the purpose, until they reach the Holy Land, and only then will their resurrection take place. But over and beyond this, Jacob had an especial reason for desiring to have his body interred in Palestine. God had said to him at Beth-el, \"The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed,\" and hence he made every endeavor to \"lie\" in the Holy Land, to make sure it would belong to him and his descendants. Nevertheless he bade Joseph strew some Egyptian earth over his dead body. Jacob expressed these his last wishes three times. Such is the requirement of good breeding in preferring a request. In the last period of Jacob's life, one can see how true it is that \"even a king depends upon favors in a strange land.\" Jacob, the man for the sake of whose merits the whole world was created, for the sake of whom Abraham was delivered from the fiery furnace, had to ask services of others while he was among strangers, and when Joseph promised to do his bidding, he bowed himself before his own son, for it is a true saying, \"Bow before the fox in his day,\" the day of his power. He was not satisfied with a simple promise from Joseph, that he would do his wish; he insisted upon his taking an oath by the sign of the covenant of Abraham, putting a hand under his thigh in accordance with the ceremony customary among the Patriarchs! But Joseph said: \"Thou treatest me like a slave. With me thou hast no need to require an oath. Thy command sufficeth.\" Jacob, however, urged him, saying: \"I fear Pharaoh may command thee to bury me in the sepulchre with the kings of Egypt. I insist that thou takest an oath, and then I will be at peace.\" Joseph gave in, though he would not submit to the ceremony that Eliezer had used to confirm the oath he took at the request of his master Abraham. The slave acted in accordance with the rules of slavery, the free man acted in accordance with the dictates of freedom. And in a son that thing would have been unseemly which was becoming in a slave. When Joseph swore to bury his father in Palestine, he added the words, \"As thou commandest me to do, so also will I beg my brethren, on my death-bed, to fulfil my last wish and carry my body from Egypt to Palestine.\" Jacob, noticing the Shekinah over the bed's head, where she always rests in a sick room, bowed himself upon the bed's head, saying, \"I thank thee, O Lord my God, that none who is unfit came forth from my bed, but my bed was perfect.\" He was particularly grateful for the revelation God had vouchsafed him concerning his first-born son Reuben, that he had repented of his trespass against his father, and atoned for it by penance. He was thus assured that all his sons were men worthy of being the progenitors of the twelve tribes, and he was blessed with happiness such as neither Abraham nor Isaac had known, for both of them had had unworthy as well as worthy sons. Until the time of Jacob death had always come upon men suddenly, and snatched them away before they were warned of the imminent end by sickness. Once Jacob spoke to God, saying, \"O Lord of the world, a man dies suddenly, and he is not laid low first by sickness, and he cannot acquaint his children with his wishes regarding all he leaves behind. But if a man first fell sick, and felt that his end were drawing nigh, he would have time to set his house in order.\" And God said, \"Verily, thy request is sensible, and thou shalt be the first to profit by the new dispensation,\" and so it happened that Jacob fell sick a little while before his death. His sickness troubled him grievously, for he had undergone much during his life. He had worked day and night while he was with Laban, and his conflicts with the angel and with Esau, though he came off victor from both, had weakened him, and he was not in a condition to endure the hardships of disease.",

      "title": "The Blessing Of Ephraim And Manasseh",
      "content": "All the years of Jacob's sojourn in Egypt, Asenath, the wife of Joseph, was his constant nurse. When she saw his end drawing nigh, she spoke to Joseph: \"I have heard that one who is blessed by a righteous man is as though he had been blessed by the Shekinah. Therefore, bring thy sons hither, that Jacob give them his blessing.\" Though Joseph was a devoted and loving son to his father, he was not in constant attendance upon him, because he wanted to avoid giving him the opportunity of inquiring into the circumstances of his coming to Egypt. He was apprehensive that Jacob might curse his sons and bring death upon them, if he discovered the facts connected with their treacherous dealings with Joseph. He took good care therefore never to be alone with his father. But as he desired to be kept informed of his welfare, he arranged a courier service between himself and Jacob. Now when Joseph received the news of his father's having fallen sick, through his messenger, as well as through Ephraim, whom Jacob was instructing in the Torah, he hastened to the land of Goshen, taking his two sons with him. He desired to have certainty upon five points: Would his father bless his two sons, who were born in Egypt, and, if so, would he appoint them to be heads of tribes? Would he assign the rights of the first-born unto himself, and, if so, would he divest Reuben of such rights altogether? And why had his father buried his mother Rachel by the wayside, and not carried her body to the family tomb at Machpelah? Jacob had also entertained doubts on five points, when he was about to emigrate from Canaan to Egypt: He did not know whether his descendants would lose themselves among the people of Egypt; whether he would die there and be buried there; and whether he would be permitted to see Joseph and see the sons of Joseph. God gave him the assurance, saying, \"I will go down with thee into Egypt, and I will surely bring thee up again after thy death, and thy descendants also, and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.\" When the time approached for the fulfilment of the Divine promise, God appeared unto Jacob, and He said, \"I promised to fulfil thy wish, and the time of fulfilment hath come.\" The holy spirit made known to Jacob that Joseph was coming to him, and he strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed in order to pay due respect to the representative of the government. Though Joseph was his son, he was also viceroy, and entitled to special marks of honor. Besides, Jacob desired to make the impression of being a man in good health. He wanted to avoid the possibility of having his blessing of Joseph and Joseph's sons questioned as the act of an irresponsible person. He strengthened himself spiritually as well as physically, by prayer to God, in which he besought Him to let the holy spirit descend upon him at the time of his giving the blessing to the sons of Joseph. When Joseph appeared in the company of his two sons, his father said to him: \"In all the seventeen years thou hast been visiting me, thou didst never bring thy sons with thee, but now they have come, and I know the reason. If I bless them, I shall act in opposition to the word of God, who promised to make me the progenitor of twelve tribes, for if I adopt them as my sons, there will be fourteen tribes. But if I do not bless them, it will plunge thee in sorrow. So be it, I will bless them. But think not I do it because thou didst support me all these years. There is quite another reason. When I left my father's house to go to Haran, I offered up a prayer at Beth-el, and I promised to give unto God the tenth of all I owned. So far as my material possessions are concerned, I kept my vow, but I could not give the tithe of my sons, because according to the law I had to withdraw from the reckoning the four sons, Reuben, Joseph, Dan, and Gad, that are the first-born children of their mothers. When I returned, God again appeared unto me in Beth-el, and He said, Be fruitful and multiply. But after this blessing no son was born unto me except Benjamin alone, and it cannot be but that God meant Manasseh and Ephraim when He spoke of 'a nation and a company of nations.' If now I have found favor in thy sight, thy two sons Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simon, shall be mine, and then I shall be able to give a tenth part of my ten sons unto the Lord, and I shall leave this world free from the sin of not keeping my vow to the Lord concerning the tithe-giving.\" Joseph consented to do his father's will, and Jacob tithed his sons, consecrating Levi to the Holy One, and appointing him to be the chief of his brethren. He enjoined his sons to have a care that there should never fail them a son of Levi in the priestly succession. And it happened that. of all the tribes Levi was the only one that never proved faithless to the covenant of the fathers. Thus Jacob adopted Manasseh and Ephraim to be his own sons, even as Reuben and Simon were his sons. They were entitled like the others to a portion in the Holy Land, and like the others they were to bear standards on their journey through the desert. Satisfied as to Jacob's intentions concerning his sons, Joseph asked his father about his mother's burial-place, and Jacob spoke, saying: \"As thou livest, thy wish to see thy mother lying by my side in the grave doth not exceed mine own. I had joy in life only as long as she was alive, and her death was the heaviest blow that ever fell upon me.\" Joseph questioned him: \"Perhaps thou didst have to bury her in the way, because she died during the rainy season, and thou couldst not carry her body through the rain to our family sepulchre?\" \"No,\" replied Jacob, \"she died in the spring time, when the highways are clean and firm.\" Joseph: \"Grant me permission to take up her body now and place it in our family burial-place.\" Jacob: \"No, my son, that thou mayest not do. I was unwilling to bury her in the way, but the Lord commanded it.\" The reason of the command was that God knew that the Temple would be destroyed, and Israel would be carried away into banishment, and the exiles would ask the Patriarchs to intercede for them with God, but God would not hearken unto them. On their way to the land of the stranger they would pass the grave of Rachel, and they would throw themselves upon it, and beseech their mother to make intercession for them with God. And Rachel would pray to God in their behalf: \"O Lord of the world, look upon my tears, and have compassion upon my children. But if Thou wilt not take pity on them, then indemnify me for the wrong done to me.\" Unto her prayer God will hearken, and He will have mercy upon Israel. Therefore was Rachel buried in the way. Now Jacob desired to bless the sons of Joseph, but the holy spirit made him to see Jeroboam, the descendant of Ephraim, and Jehu, the descendant of Manasseh, how they would seduce Israel to idolatry, and the Shekinah forsook him as he was about to lay his hands upon the heads of his grandsons. He said to Joseph, \"Is it possible that thou didst not marry the mother of thy children according to the law?\" Joseph thereupon brought his wife Asenath to his father, and pointing to her marriage contract, he said, \"This one is my wife, whom I married as is proper, with a marriage contract and due ceremony. I pray thee, my father, bless my sons if only for the sake of this pious woman.\" Jacob bade his grandsons approach close to him, and he kissed and embraced them, in the hope that his joy in them would lure back the holy spirit, but his hope was vain. Joseph concluded that the time was not favorable for blessing, and he decided to go away until a more propitious opportunity presented itself, first, however, proving to his father that his sons had been initiated in the covenant of Abraham. Outside of his father's chamber, alone with his sons, he threw himself down before God and besought Him to show him mercy, and he bade his sons do likewise, saying, \"Be not content with your high station, for worldly honors are but for a time. Entreat God to be merciful and let the Shekinah descend upon my father, that he bless you both.\" Then spake God to the holy spirit: \"How long yet shall Joseph suffer? Reveal thyself quickly, and enter into Jacob, that he may be able to bestow blessings.\" In the words of Jacob, \"Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simon, shall be mine,\" Joseph had noticed his father's preference for his younger son Ephraim. It made him very anxious about his older son's birthright, and he was careful to put the two lads before his father in such wise that Manasseh should stand opposite Jacob's right hand, and Ephraim opposite his left hand. But Ephraim, on account of his modesty, was destined for greater things than his older brother Manasseh, and God bade the holy spirit prompt Jacob to give the birthright to Ephraim. Now when Joseph observed his father put his right hand upon Ephraim's head, he made an attempt to remove it unto Manasseh's head. But Jacob warded him off, saying: \"What, thou wouldst displace my hand against my will, the hand that overcame the prince of the angel hosts, who is as large as one-third of the world! I know things not known to thee—I know what Reuben did to Bilhah, and what Judah did to Tamar. How much more do I know things known to thee! Thinkest thou I know not what thy brethren did to thee, because thou wouldst betray nothing whenever I asked thee? I know it, Manasseh also shall become great, the judge Gideon shall descend from him, but his younger brother will be the ancestor of Joshua, who will bring the sun and the moon to a standstill, though they have dominion over the whole earth from end to end.\" Thus did Jacob set Ephraim the younger above Manasseh the older, and thus did it remain unto all times. In the list of the generations, Manasseh comes after Ephraim, and so it was in the allotment of the portions in the Holy Land, and so it was in the placing of the camps and the standards of the tribes, and in the dedication of the Tabernacle—everywhere Ephraim preceded Manasseh. The blessing bestowed upon his grandchildren by Jacob was as follows: \"O that it be the will of God that ye walk in the ways of the Lord like unto my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may the angel that hath redeemed me from all evil give his aid unto Joshua and Gideon, and reveal himself unto them. May your names be named on Israel, and like unto fishes may you grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth, and as fishes are protected by the water, so may you be protected by the merits of Joseph.\" The words \"like unto fishes\" were used by Jacob for the purpose of intimating the manner of death awaiting the Ephraimites, the descendants of Joseph. As fish are caught by their mouth, so the Ephraimites were in later days to invite their doom by their peculiar lisp. At the same time, Jacob's words contained the prophecy that Joshua the son of the man Nun, the \"fish,\" would lead Israel into the Holy Land. And in his words lay still another prophecy, with reference to the sixty thousand men children begot in the same night as Moses, all cast into the river with him, and saved for the sake of his merits. The number of boys thrown to the fishes in the river that night was equal to the number of men in Israel upon the earth. Ephraim received a special and separate blessing from his grandfather. Jacob said to him, \"Ephraim, my son, thou art the head of the Academy, and in the days to come my most excellent and celebrated descendants will be called Ephrati after thee.\" Joseph received two gifts from his father. The first was Shechem, the city that Jacob had defended, with sword and bow, against the depredations of the Amorite kings when they tried to take revenge upon his sons for the outrage committed there. And the second gift was the garments made by God for Adam and passed from hand to hand, until they came into the possession of Jacob. Shechem was his reward, because, with his chastity, he stemmed the tide of immorality that burst loose in Shechem first of all. Besides, he had a prior claim upon the city. Shechem, son of Hamor, the master of the city, had given it to Dinah as a present, and the wife of Joseph, Asenath, being the daughter of Dinah, the city belonged to him by right. Adam's clothes Jacob had received from Esau. He had not taken them from his brother by force, but God had caused them to be given to him as a reward for his good deeds. They had belonged to Nimrod. Once when the mighty hunter caught Esau in his preserves, and forbade him to go on the chase, they agreed to determine by combat what their privileges were. Esau had taken counsel with Jacob, and he had advised him never to fight with Nimrod while he was clothed in Adam's garments. The two now wrestled with each other, and at the time Nimrod was not dressed in Adam's clothes. The end was that he was slain by Esau. Thus the garments worn by Adam fell into the hands of Esau, from him they passed into Jacob's, and he bequeathed them to Joseph. Jacob also taught Joseph three signs whereby to distinguish the true redeemer, who should deliver Israel from the bondage of Egypt. He would proclaim the Ineffable Name, appoint elders, and use the word Pakod in addressing the people.",

      "content": "When Joseph and his two sons left Jacob, his brethren, envious of the bountiful blessings bestowed upon the three, said, \"The whole world loveth a favorite of fortune, and our father hath blessed Joseph thus because he is a ruler of men.\" Then spoke Jacob: \"They that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing. I have blessings enough for all.\" Jacob summoned his sons from the land of Egypt, and bade them come to him at Raamses, first, however, commanding them to make themselves clean, that the blessing he was about to bestow might attach itself to them. Another one of his commands was that they were to establish an Academy, by the members of which they were to be governed. When his sons were brought into his presence by the angels, Jacob spoke, saying, \"Take heed that no dissensions spring up among you, for union is the first condition of Israel's redemption,\" and he was on the point of revealing the great secret to them concerning the end of time, but while they were standing around the golden bed whereon their father lay, the Shekinah visited him for a moment and departed as quickly, and with her departed also all trace of the knowledge of the great mystery from the mind of Jacob. He had the same experience as his own father Isaac, who also had loss of memory inflicted upon him by God, to prevent him from revealing the secret at the end of time to Esau, when he summoned him to receive his blessing. The accident made Jacob apprehensive that his sons were not pious enough to be considered worthy of the revelation concerning the Messianic era, and he said to them, \"Ishmael and the sons of Keturah were the blemished among the issue of my grandfather Abraham; my father Isaac begot a blemished issue in Esau, and I fear now that among you, too, there is one that harbors the intention to serve idols.\" The twelve men spake, and said: \"Hear, O Israel, our father, the Eternal our God is the One Only God. As thy heart is one and united in avouching the Holy One, blessed be He, to be thy God, so also are our hearts one and united in avouching Him.\" Whereto Jacob responded, \"Praised be the Name of the glory of His majesty forever and ever!\" And although the whole mystery of the Messianic time was not communicated to the sons of Jacob, yet the blessing of each contained some reference to the events of the future. These were the words addressed by Jacob to his oldest son: \"Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength! Thy portion should have been three crowns. Thou shouldst have had the double heritage of thy primogeniture, and the priestly dignity, and the royal power. But by reason of thy sin, the birthright is conferred upon Joseph, kingship upon Judah, and the priesthood upon Levi. My son, I know no healing remedy for thee, but the man Moses, who will ascend to God, he will make thee whole, and God will forgive thy sin. I bless thee—may thy descendants be heroes in the Torah and heroes in war. Though thou must lose thy birthright, yet wilt thou be the first to enter into possession of thy allotment in the Holy Land, and in thy territory shall be the first of the cities of refuge, and always shall thy name stand first in the list of the families of the tribes. Yea, thou shalt also be the first whose heritage will be seized by the enemy, and the first to be carried away into the lands of exile.\" After Reuben had had his \"ears pulled\" thus, he retired, and Jacob called his sons Simon and Levi to his side, and he addressed them in these words: \"Brethren ye were of Dinah, but not of Joseph, whom you sold into slavery. The weapons of violence wherewith ye smote Shechem were stolen weapons, for it was not seemly for you to draw the sword. That was Esau's portion. To him was it said, By thy sword shalt thou live. Into the council of the tribe of Simon my soul will not come when they foregather at Shittim to do vicious deeds, and my glory will not be united unto the assembly of Korah, the descendants of Levi. In their anger Simon and Levi slew the prince of Shechem, and in their self-will they sold Joseph the bull into slavery. Accursed was the city of Shechem when they entered to destroy it. If they remain united, no ruler will be able to stand up before them, no war will prosper against them. Therefore will I divide and scatter their possession among the possessions of the other tribes. The descendants of Simon will many of them be poor men, who will wander from tribe to tribe and beg for bread, and also Levi's tribe will gather its tithes and gifts from all the others.\" The words of Jacob, \"I will divide them in Jacob,\" spoken of Simon and Levi, were fulfilled on Simon in particular. When twenty-four thousand of Simon fell at Shittim, the widows they left behind married husbands of all the other tribes. Nevertheless Jacob did not dismiss Simon and Levi without blessing them; the tribe of Simon was to bring forth the teachers and the beadles needed by all Israel, and Levi, the scholars that would expound the Torah and render decisions according to its teachings. When the remaining sons of Jacob heard the rebukes dealt out by their father to these three, they feared to hear like reproaches, and they tried to slip away from his presence. Especially Judah was alarmed, that his father might taunt him with his trespass touching Tamar. But Jacob spoke thus to him: \"Judah, thou dost deserve thy name. Thy mother called thee Jehudah, because she gave praise to God at thy birth, and so shall thy brethren praise thee, and they all will call themselves by thy name. And as thou didst confess thy sin openly, so also thy descendants, Achan, David, and Manasseh, will make public avowal of their sins, and the Lord will hear their prayer. Thy hands will send darts after the fleeing foe, and thy father's sons shall pay thee respect. Thou hast the impudence of a dog and the bravery of a lion. Thou didst save Joseph from death, and Tamar and her two sons from the flames. No people and no kingdom will be able to stand up against thee. Rulers shall not cease from the house of Judah, nor teachers of the law from his posterity, until his descendant Messiah come, and the obedience of all peoples be unto him. How glorious is Messiah of the House of Judah! His loins girded, he will go out to do battle with his enemies. No king and no ruler will prevail against him. The mountains will be dyed red with their blood, and the garments of Messiah will be like the garments of him that presseth wine. The eyes of Messiah will be clearer than pure wine, for they will never behold unchastity and bloodshed; and his teeth will be whiter than milk, for never will they bite aught that is taken by violence.\" Though Issachar was the older, Zebulon came next to be blessed, as a reward for the sacrifice he had made for his brother's sake, for when Issachar chose the study of the Torah as his vocation, Zebulon decided to devote himself to business and support his brother with the profits of his trade, that he might give himself up to the law undisturbed. His blessing was that he would conquer the seacoast as far as Zidon. \"Issachar,\" said Jacob, \"will take upon himself the burden of the study of the Torah, and all the other tribes will come to him and ask him to decide their doubts on legal questions, and his descendants will be the members of the Sanhedrin and the scholars that will occupy themselves with fixing the calendar.\" Jacob blessed Issachar also with the blessing, that the fruits of his land should be exceedingly large, and this brought a heavenly as well as an earthly profit in its train, for when the heathen to whom the fruits were sold marvelled thereat, the Jewish merchants explained that their extraordinary size was due to the merits of the tribe of Issachar, whom God rewarded for their devotion to the Torah, and thus many of the heathen were induced to convert to Judaism. In blessing Dan, Jacob's thoughts were occupied chiefly with his descendant Samson, who, like unto God, without any manner of assistance, conferred victory upon his people. Jacob even believed the strong, heroic man to be the Messiah, but when Samson's death was revealed to him, he exclaimed, \"I wait for Thy salvation, O Lord, for Thy help is unto all eternity, while Samson's help is only for a time. The redemption\" continued Jacob, \"will not be accomplished by Samson the Danite, but by Elijah the Gadite, who will appear at the end of time.\" Asher's blessing was the beauty of his women, who would be sought in marriage by kings and high priests. In Naphtali's land all fruits would ripen quickly, and they would be brought as presents to kings, and gain royal favor for the givers. This blessing was fulfilled in the plain of Gennesaret. At the same time Naphtali's blessing was a prophecy concerning his descendant Deborah, who was like a hind let loose against Sisera to conquer him, and she gave goodly words in her song of Israel's victory. Naphtali himself deserved the description applied to Deborah, for he was swift as a hart to do the will of God, and he was a fleet messenger unto his father and the tribes. They sent him whithersoever they would, and he executed their errands with dispatch. He served the brethren of Joseph as herald, to announce unto Jacob the glad tidings, \"Joseph is yet alive,\" and when the stricken father saw him approach, he said, \"Lo, here cometh Naphtali the lovable, who proclaimeth peace.\" Joseph's blessing exceeded the blessing of all his brethren. Jacob spoke: \"O son whom I bred up, Joseph, whom I raised, and who wast strong to resist the enticements of sin, thou didst conquer all the magicians and the wise men of Egypt by thy wisdom and thy pious deeds. The daughters of princes cast their jewels before thee, to draw thine eyes upon them when thou didst pass through the land of Egypt, but thou didst not look their way, and therefore wast thou made the father of two tribes. The magicians and the wise men of Egypt sought to defame thee before Pharaoh and slander thee, but thou didst set thy hope in the Almighty. Therefore may He who appeared unto me as El Shaddai bless thee and grant thee fertile soil and much cattle. May the blessing thy father giveth thee now, and the blessing that his fathers Abraham and Isaac gave him, and that called forth the envy of the great of the world, Ishmael, Esau, and the sons of Keturah—may all these blessings be a crown upon the head of Joseph, and a chain upon the neck of him that was the ruler of Egypt, and yet diminished not the honor due to his brethren.\" The slander of which Jacob spoke referred to what Potiphar had said of Joseph before Pharaoh. He had complained, saying, \"Why didst thou appoint my slave, whom I did buy for twenty pieces of silver, to be ruler over the Egyptians?\" Joseph had then taken up his own defense, saying: \"When thou didst buy me as a slave, thou didst commit a capital crime. Only a descendant of Canaan may be sold as a slave, and I am a descendant of Shem, and a prince besides. If thou wilt convince thyself of the truth of my words, do but compare me with the likeness of my mother Sarah that Pharaoh had made of her!\" They brought Sarah's likeness, and, verily, it appeared that Joseph resembled his ancestress, and all were convinced of his noble lineage. The blessing that Jacob bestowed upon Benjamin contains the prophecy that his tribe would provide Israel with his first ruler and his last ruler, and so it was, for Saul and Esther both belonged to the tribe of Benjamin. Likewise Benjamin's heritage in the Holy Land harbors two extremes: Jericho ripens its fruits earlier than any other region in Palestine, while Beth-el ripens them latest. In Benjamin's blessing, Jacob referred also to the service in the Temple, because the Holy Place was situated in the territory of Benjamin. And when Jacob called his youngest son a wolf that ravineth, he was thinking of the judge Ehud, the great scholar, a Benjamite, who conquered Eglon king of Moab, and also he had in mind the Benjamites that captured their wives by cunning and force. Again, if he called Benjamin a wolf, Judah a lion, and Joseph a bull, he wanted to point to the three kingdoms known as wolf, lion, and bull, the doom of which was and will be sealed by the descendants of his three sons: Babylon, the kingdom of the lion, fell through the hands of Daniel of the tribe of Judah; Media, the wolf, found its master in the Benjamite Mordecai; and the bull Joseph will subdue the horned beast, the kingdom of wickedness, before the Messianic time.",

      "content": "After Jacob had blessed each of his sons separately, he addressed himself to all of them together, saying: \"According to my power did I bless you, but in future days a prophet will arise, and this man Moses will bless you, too, and he will continue my blessings where I left off.\" He added, besides, that the blessing of each tribe should redound to the good of all the other tribes: the tribe of Judah should have a share in the fine wheat of the tribe of Benjamin, and Benjamin should enjoy the goodly barley of Judah. The tribes should be mutually helpful, one to another. Moreover, he charged them not to be guilty of idolatry in any form or shape and not to let blasphemous speech pass their lips, and he taught them the order of transporting his bier, thus: \"Joseph, being king, shall not help to bear it, nor shall Levi, who is destined to carry the Ark of the Shekinah. Judah, Issachar, and Zebulon shall grasp its front end, Reuben, Simon, and Gad its right side, Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin the hindmost end, and Dan, Asher, and Naphtali its left side.\" And this was the order in which the tribes, bearing each its standard, were to march through the desert, the Shekinah dwelling in the midst of them. Jacob then spake to Joseph, saying: \"And thou, my son Joseph, forgive thy brethren for their trespass against thee, forsake them not, and grieve them not, for the Lord hath put them into thine hands, that thou shouldst protect them all thy days against the Egyptians.\" Also he admonished his sons, saying that the Lord would be with them if they walked in His ways, and He would redeem them from the hands of the Egyptians. \"I know,\" he continued, \"great suffering will befall your sons and your grandsons in this land, but if you will obey God, and teach your sons to know Him, then He will send you a redeemer, who will bring you forth out of Egypt and lead you into the land of your fathers.\" In resignation to the will of God, Jacob awaited his end, and death enveloped him gently. Not the Angel of Death ended his life, but the Shekinah took his soul with a kiss. Beside the three Patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, only Moses, Aaron, and Miriam breathed their last in this manner, through the kiss of the Shekinah. And these six, together with Benjamin, are the only ones whose corpses are not exposed to the ravages of the worms, and they neither corrupt nor decay. Thus Jacob departed this world, and entered the world to come, a foretaste of which he had enjoyed here below, like the other two Patriarchs, and none beside among men. In another respect their life in this world resembled their life in the world to come, the evil inclination had no power over them, either here or there, wherein David resembled them. Joseph ordered his father's body to be placed upon a couch of ivory, covered with gold, studded with gems, and hung with drapery of byssus and purple. Fragrant wine was poured out at its side, and aromatic spices burnt next to it. Heroes of the house of Esau, princes of the family of Ishmael, and the lion Judah, the bravest of his sons, surrounded the sumptuous bier of Jacob. \"Come,\" said Judah to his brethren, \"let us plant a high cedar tree at the head of our father's grave, its top shall reach up to the skies, its branches shall shade all the inhabitants of the earth, and its roots shall grow down deep into the earth, unto the abyss. For from him are sprung twelve tribes, and from him will arise kings and rulers, chapters of priests prepared to perform the service of the sacrifices, and companies of Levites ready to sing psalms and play upon sweet instruments.\" The sons of Jacob tore their garments and girded their loins with sackcloth, threw themselves upon the ground, and strewed earth upon their heads until the dust rose in a high cloud. And when Asenath, the wife of Joseph, heard the tidings of Jacob's death, she came, and with her came the women of Egypt, to weep and mourn over him. And the men of Egypt that had known Jacob repaired thither, and they mourned day after day, and also many journeyed down into Egypt from Canaan, to take part in the seventy days' mourning made for him. The Egyptians spake to one another, saying, \"Let us lament for the pious man Jacob, because the affliction of the famine was averted from our land on account of his merits,\" for instead of ravaging the land for forty-two years according to the decree of God, the famine had lasted but two years, and that was due to the virtues of Jacob. Joseph ordered the physicians to embalm the corpse. This he should have refrained from doing, for it was displeasing to God, who spoke, saying: \"Have I not the power to preserve the corpse of this pious man from corruption? Was it not I that spoke the reassuring words, Fear not the worm, O Jacob, thou dead Israel?\" Joseph's punishment for this useless precaution was that he was the first of the sons of Jacob to suffer death. The Egyptians, on the other hand, who devoted forty days to embalming the corpse and preparing it for burial, were rewarded for the veneration they showed. Before He destroyed their city, God gave the Ninevites a forty days' respite on account of their king, who was the Pharaoh of Egypt. And for the three score and ten days of mourning that the heathen made for Jacob, they were recompensed at the time of Ahasuerus. During seventy days, from the thirteenth of Nisan, the date of Haman's edict ordering the extermination of the Jews, until the twenty-third of Siwan, when Mordecai recalled it, they were permitted to enjoy absolute power over the Jews. When all preparations for the burial of Jacob had been completed, Joseph asked permission of Pharaoh to carry the body up into Canaan. But he did not himself go to put his petition before Pharaoh, for he could not well appear before the king in the garb of a mourner, nor was he willing to interrupt his lamentation over his father for even a brief space and stand before Pharaoh and prefer his petition. He requested the family of Pharaoh to intercede for him with the king for the additional reason that he was desirous of enlisting the favor of the king's relations, lest they advise Pharaoh not to fulfil his wish. He acted according to the maxim, \"Seek to win over the accuser, that he cause thee no annoyance.\" Joseph applied first to the queen's hairdresser, and she influenced the queen to favor him, and then the queen put in a good word for him with the king. At first Pharaoh refused the permission craved by Joseph, who, however, urged him to consider the solemn oath he had given his dying father, to bury him in Canaan. Pharaoh desired him to seek absolution from the oath. But Joseph rejoined, \"Then will I apply also for absolution from the oath I gave thee,\" referring to an incident in his earlier history. The grandees of Egypt had advised Pharaoh against appointing Joseph as viceroy, and they did not recede from this counsel until Joseph, in his conversation with the Egyptian king, proved himself to be master of the seventy languages of the world, the necessary condition to be fulfilled before one could become ruler over Egypt. But the conversation proved something else, that Pharaoh himself was not entitled to Egyptian kingship, because he lacked knowledge of Hebrew. He feared, if the truth became known, Joseph would be raised to his own place, for he knew Hebrew beside all the other tongues. In his anxiety and distress, Pharaoh made Joseph swear an oath never to betray the king's ignorance of Hebrew. Now when Joseph threatened to have himself absolved from this oath as well as the one to his dying father, great terror overwhelmed him, and he speedily granted Joseph permission to go up to Canaan and bury his father there. Moreover, Pharaoh issued a decree in all parts of the land menacing those with death who would not accompany Joseph and his brethren upon their journey to Canaan with their father's remains, and accordingly the procession that followed the bier of Jacob was made up of the princes and nobles of Egypt as well as the common people. The bier was borne by the sons of Jacob. In obedience to his wish not even their children were allowed to touch it. It was fashioned of pure gold, the border thereof inlaid with onyx stones and bdellium, and the cover was gold woven work joined to the bier with threads that were held together with hooks of onyx stones and bdellium. Joseph placed a large golden crown upon the head of his father, and a golden sceptre he put in his hand, arraying him like a living king. The funeral cortege was arranged in this order: First came the valiant men of Pharaoh and the valiant men of Joseph, and then the rest of the inhabitants of Egypt. All were girt with swords and clothed in coats of mail, and the trappings of war were upon them. The weepers and mourners walked, crying and lamenting, at some distance from the bier, and the rest of the people went behind it, while Joseph and his household followed together after it, with bare feet and in tears, and Joseph's servants were close to him, each man with his accoutrements and weapons of war. Fifty of Jacob's servants preceded the bier, strewing myrrh upon the road in passing, and all manner of perfumes, so that the sons of Jacob trod upon the aromatic spices as they carried the body forward. Thus the procession moved on until it reached Canaan. It halted at the threshing-floor of Atad, and there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation. But the greatest honor conferred upon Jacob was the presence of the Shekinah, who accompanied the cortege. The Canaanites had no intention at first to take part in the mourning made for Jacob, but when they saw the honors shown him, they joined the procession of the Egyptians, loosing the girdles of their garments as a sign of grief. Also the sons of Esau, Ishmael, and Keturah appeared, though their design in coming was to seize the opportunity and make war upon the sons of Jacob, but when they saw Joseph's crown suspended from the bier, the Edomite and Ishmaelite kings and princes followed his example, and attached theirs to it, too, and it was ornamented with thirty-six crowns. Nevertheless the conflict was not averted; it broke out in the end between the sons of Jacob and Esau and his followers. When the former were about to lower the body of their father into the Cave of Machpelah, Esau attempted to prevent it, saying that Jacob had used his allotted portion of the tomb for Leah, and the only space left for a grave belonged to himself. For, continued Esau, \"though I sold my birthright unto Jacob, I yet have a portion in the tomb as a son of Isaac.\" The sons of Jacob, however, were well aware of the fact that their father had acquired Esau's share in the Cave, and they even knew that a bill of sale existed, but Esau, assuming properly that the document was left behind in Egypt, denied that any such had ever been made out, and the sons of Jacob sent Naphtali, the fleet runner, back to Egypt to fetch the bill. Meantime, while this altercation was going on between Esau and the others, Hushim the son of Dan arose and inquired in astonishment why they did not proceed with the burial of Jacob, for he was deaf and had not understood the words that had passed between the disputants. When he heard what it was all about, and that the ceremonies were interrupted until Naphtali should return from Egypt with the bill of sale, he exclaimed, with indignation, \"My grandfather shall lie here unburied until Naphtali comes back!\" and he seized a club and dealt Esau a vigorous blow, so that he died, and his eyes fell out of their sockets and dropped upon Jacob's knees, and Jacob opened his own eyes and smiled. Esau being dead, his brother's burial could proceed without hindrance, and Joseph interred him in the Cave of Machpelah in accordance with his wish. His other children had left all arrangements connected with the burial of their father's body to their brother Joseph, for they reflected that it was a greater honor for Jacob if a king concerned himself about his remains rather than simple private individuals. The head of Esau, as he lay slain by the side of Jacob's grave, rolled down into the Cave, and fell into the lap of Isaac, who prayed to God to have mercy upon his son, but his supplications were in vain. God spoke, saying, \"As I live, he shall not behold the majesty of the Lord.\"",

      "content": "Jacob having been interred with royal pomp, and the seven days' period of mourning over, the conflict between the sons of Jacob and the sons of Esau broke out anew. In the skirmish that had ensued when Esau advanced a claim upon a place in the Cave of Machpelah, while his brother's remains still lay unburied, he lost forty of his men, and after his death fortune favored his sons as little. Eighty of their followers were slain, while of the sons of Jacob not one was lost. Joseph succeeded in capturing Zepho the son of Eliphaz and fifty of his men, and he clapped them in chains and carried them off to Egypt. Thereupon the rest of the attacking army led by Eliphaz fled to Mount Seir, taking with them the headless corpse of Esau, to bury it in his own territory. The sons of Jacob pursued after them, but they slew none, out of respect for the remains of Esau. On the third day a great army gathered together, consisting of the inhabitants of Seir and the children of the East, and they marched down into Egypt with the purpose of making war upon Joseph and his brethren. In the battle that came off, this army was almost totally destroyed, not less than six hundred thousand men were mowed down by Joseph and his warriors, and the small remnant fled precipitately. Returned to their own country after this fatal campaign, the sons of Esau and the sons of Seir fell to quarrelling among themselves, and the sons of Seir demanded that their former allies leave the place, because it was they that had brought misfortune upon the country. The sons of Esau thereupon dispatched a messenger in secret to their friend Agnias, king of Africa, begging his aid against the sons of Seir. He granted their request, and sent them troops consisting of foot-soldiers and mounted men. The sons of Seir, on their part, also sought allies, and they secured the help of the children of the East, and of the Midianites, who put warriors at their disposal. In the encounters that ensued between the hostile forces, the sons of Esau were defeated again and again, partly on account of treachery in their own ranks, for their men sometimes deserted to the enemy while the combat was on. At last, however, in the battle that took place in the desert of Paran, the sons of Esau gained a decisive victory. They massacred all the warriors of the sons of Seir, and the Midianites and the children of the East were put to flight. Thereafter the sons of Esau returned to Seir, and they slew all the inhabitants of the place, men, women, and children, sparing only fifty lads and maidens. The former they used as slaves, and the latter they took to wife. They also enriched themselves with the spoils, seizing all the possessions of the sons of Seir, and the whole land was divided among the five sons of Esau. Now these descendants of Esau determined to put a king over themselves, but in consequence of the treachery committed during the war there prevailed such hatred and bitterness among them that they decided never to appoint a ruler from their own people. Their choice fell upon Bela, the son of Beor, one of the warriors sent to them by King Agnias. His peer could not be found among the allied troops for bravery, wisdom, and handsome appearance. They set the royal crown upon his head, built a palace for him, and gave him gifts of silver, gold, and gems, until he lived in great opulence. He reigned happily for thirty years, and met his death then in a war against Joseph and his brethren. This war came about because the sons of Esau could not banish from their memory the disgrace of the defeat inflicted upon them by Joseph and his people. Having enlisted the aid of Agnias, and of the Ishmaelites and other nations of the East, they set forth on a second campaign against Egypt, in the hope of delivering Zepho and his followers from the hands of Joseph. In spite of their enormous host—they had no less than eight hundred thousand men of infantry and cavalry—they were defeated at Raamses by Joseph and his brethren and their little company of six hundred men. Beside their king Bela, they left one-fourth of their army upon the field. The loss of their king discouraged them grievously, and they took to flight, hard pressed by Joseph, who cut down many of the fugitives. When he returned from the battle, Joseph ordered manacles and fetters to be put upon Zepho and his followers, and their captivity was made more bitter unto them than it had been before. The sons of Esau appointed Jobab of Bozrah to succeed their dead king Bela. His reign lasted ten years, but they desisted from all further attempts at waging war with the sons of Jacob. Their last experience with them had been too painful, but the enmity they cherished against them was all the fiercer, and their hatred never abated. Their third king was Husham, and he ruled over them for twenty years. During his reign Zepho succeeded in making good his escape from Egypt. He was received kindly by Agnias, king of Africa, and appointed commander-in-chief of his troops. He used every means of persuasion to induce his sovereign lord to enter into a war with Egypt, but in vain, for Agnias was only too well acquainted with the strength and heroism of the sons of Jacob. For many years he resisted Zepho's arguments and blandishments. Indeed, as it was, Agnias had his hands full with other warlike enterprises. It had happened about this time that a man of the land of Kittim, 'Uzi by name, whom his countrymen venerated as a god, died in the city of Pozimana, and he left behind a fair and clever daughter. Agnias heard of Yaniah's beauty and wisdom, and he sued for her hand, and his request was granted him by the people of Kittim. The messengers of Agnias were hastening away from Kittim, bearing to their master the promise of the inhabitants that Yaniah should become his wife, when Turnus, king of Benevento, arrived on the same errand. His suit was rejected, for the people of Kittim were afraid-to break the promise given to Agnias. In his anger, Turnus went to Sardinia to make war upon King Lucus, a brother of Agnias, intending to deal with the latter as soon as the other was rendered harmless. Hearing of the design hatched by Turnus, Agnias hastened to Sardinia to the assistance of his brother, and a battle took place in the Valley of Campania. Against Turnus were arrayed Agnias, his brother Lucus, and the son of the latter, Niblos, whom his father had appointed commander-in-chief of the Sardinian troops. In the first encounter, Turnus was the victor, and the Sardinians lost their general Niblos. But in the second engagement the army of Turnus was routed completely, and he himself was left dead on the field. His army fled, pursued closely by Agnias as far as the cross-road between Rome and Albano. Niblos' body was put inside of a golden statue, and his father erected a high tower over his grave, and another over the grave of Turnus, and these two buildings, connected by a marble pavement, stand opposite to each other, on the cross-road at which Agnias left off from following after the fugitive army. The king of Africa went on to the city of Benevento, but he took no harsh measures against it and its inhabitants, because it belonged to the land of Kittim at that time. Thenceforth, however, bands of soldiers from Africa made incursions, now and again, into the land of Kittim, under the lead of Zepho, the captain of the African army. Agnias meantime went to Pozimana, to solemnize his marriage with Yaniah, and he returned with her to his capital in Africa.",

      "content": "All this time Zepho did not leave off urging Agnias to invade Egypt, and he succeeded finally in persuading the king to consider his wish, and a great army was equipped against Egypt and the sons of Jacob. Among the shieldbearers was Balaam, the fifteen year old son of Beor, a wise youth and an adept in magic, and the king bade him acquaint him with the issue of the war upon which they were entering. Balaam took wax and moulded the figures of men, to represent the army of Agnias and the army of the Egyptians, and he plunged them into magic water and let them swim, and it appeared that the African army was subdued by the Egyptians. Agnias accordingly gave up the campaign, and Zepho, seeing that his sovereign could not be persuaded into war with the sons of Jacob, fled the country and betook himself to Kittim. The people of Kittim received him with great honors, and they offered him much money to stay with them and conduct their wars. It happened once while Zepho was in the mountains of Koptiziah, where the inhabitants of Kittim had taken refuge before the troops of the African king, that he had to go on a search for an ox that had strayed away, and he discovered a cave the opening of which was barred by a great stone. He shivered the stone in pieces, and entering the cave he saw an animal formed like a man above and a he-goat below, and he killed the strange beast, which was in the very act of devouring his lost ox. There was great rejoicing among the people of Kittim, for the monster had long been doing havoc among their cattle, and in gratitude they set aside one day of the year, which they called by Zepho's name, in honor of their liberator, and all the people brought him presents and offered sacrifices to him. At this time it came to pass that Yaniah, the wife of King Agnias, fell into a grievous sickness, and the physicians ascribed her illness to the climate, and to the water of Africa, to which she, a native of the land of Kittim, could not get accustomed, because she had been in the habit of using the water of the river Forma, which her forefathers had drawn to her house through a conduit. Agnias sent to the land of Kittim and had some of the water of the Forma brought to Africa. Finding it much lighter than the water of his own country, he built a huge canal from the land of Kittim. to Africa, and the queen henceforth had all the Forma water she needed. Besides, he took earth and stone from Kittim, and built a palace for Yaniah, and she recovered from her illness. Meantime Zepho had won a decisive victory over the African troops that had made an incursion into the land of Kittim, and the people chose him as king. His first undertaking was a campaign against the sons of Tubal and the Islands of the Sea, and again he was successful, he subdued them completely. On his return, the people built a great palace for Zepho, and they renewed his kingship, and he continued until his death to reign as king of Kittim and of Italy. During the first thirteen years of his reign, the Africans made no attempt to disturb the peace of Kittim, but then they invaded the land, only to be severely repulsed by Zepho, who pursued the troops up to the very borders of Africa, and Agnias the king was in such consternation that he did not venture to make reprisals for some time. When he finally made a second attempt, his troops were annihilated by Zepho down to the very last man. Now Agnias, in despair, assembled all the inhabitants of Africa, as numerous as the sand on the sea-shore, and he united his great host with the army of his brother Lucus, and thus he made his third attempt upon Zepho and the people of the land of Kittim. Alarmed, Zepho wrote to his brethren in Seir, and entreated their king Hadad to send him aid. But the people of Seir had concluded an alliance with Agnias as far back as under their first king Bela, and they refused Zepho's request, and the king of Kittim had to face the host of eight hundred thousand men mustered by Agnias with his little band of three thousand. Then the people of Kittim spake to their king Zepho, saying: \"Pray for us unto the God of thy ancestors. Peradventure He may deliver us from the hand of Agnias and his army, for we have heard that He is a great God, and He delivers all that trust in Him.\" Zepho prayed unto the Lord, saying: \"O Lord, God of Abraham and Isaac, my fathers, this day may it be made known that Thou art a true God, and all the gods of the nations are vain and useless. Remember now this day unto me Thy covenant with Abraham our father, which our ancestors related unto us, and do graciously with me this day for the sake of Abraham and Isaac, our fathers, and save me and the sons of Kittim from the hand of the king of Africa, who hath come against us for battle.\" God gave ear unto Zepho's prayer, and in the first day's battle one-half of the African army fell. Agnias forthwith dispatched a decree to his country, ordering, on penalty of death and confiscation of property, that all the males of the land, including boys that bad passed their tenth year, were to join the army and fight against the people of Kittim. In spite of these new accessions, three hundred thousand strong, Agnias was beaten again by Zepho in the second battle. The African general Sosipater having fallen slain, the troops broke into flight, at their head Agnias with Lucus the brother and Asdrubal the son of Agnias. After this dire defeat the Africans made no further attempt to disturb the peace of Kittim, and their incursions ceased forever. In spite of the great victory that Zepho had won with the help of God, the king of Kittim walked in the idolatrous ways of the people whom he ruled, and in the ways of the sons of Esau, for, as saith the proverb of the ancients, \"Out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness,\" and Zepho was not other than the rest of the sons of Esau. The severe defeat inflicted upon Agnias drove Balaam from Africa to Kittim, and he was received with great honors by Zepho, who welcomed him on account of his deep wisdom. Now Zepho thought the time had arrived for him to carry out his plan of vengeance against the posterity of Jacob, all the more as in the meantime Joseph had died, and also his brethren and the valiant men of Pharaoh had passed away. He was joined in the enterprise by Hadad, the king of Edom, and by the nations of the East and the Ishmaelites. The allied army was so vast that the space it covered as it stood in rank and file was equal to a three days' journey. It formed in battle array in the Valley of Pathros, and it was met by three hundred thousand Egyptians and one hundred and fifty Israelites from Goshen. But the Egyptians did not trust the Israelites, they feared their defection to the sons of Esau and Ishmael. They therefore made an agreement with them that the Israelites were not to come to the help of the Egyptians until it appeared that the enemy were getting the upper hand Zepho, who had a high opinion of Balaam's ability, desired him to use his magic arts and find out what would be the outcome of the war, but Balaam's knowledge failed him, he could not satisfy the king's wish. The Egyptians got the worst of the first encounter between the two hostile armies, but the aspect of things changed as soon as they summoned the Israelites to aid them. The Israelites prayed to God to support them with His help, and the Lord heard their prayer. Then they threw themselves upon Zepho and his allies, and after they had cut down several thousand men, such dismay and confusion took hold of the enemy that they fled hastily, pursued by the Israelites as far as the boundary of the country. The Egyptians, instead of coming to the assistance of the Israelites, had taken to flight, leaving the small band of their allies to dispose of the huge host of their adversaries. Embittered by such treatment, the Israelites slew as many as two hundred Egyptians, under the pretext that they thought they belonged to the enemy.",

      "content": "Hadad, the king of Edom, who had failed to gain fame and honor in the Egyptian campaign, was favored by fortune in another war, a war against Moab. The Moabites shrank from meeting Hadad alone, and they made an alliance with the Midianites. In the thick of the fight the Moabites fled from the field of battle, leaving the Midianites to their fate, and these deserted allies of theirs were cut down to a man by Hadad and his Edomites. The Moabites saved their skins, and suffered only the inconvenience of having to pay tribute. To avenge the faithlessness practiced against them, the Midianites, supported by their kinsmen, the sons of Keturah, gathered a mighty army, and attacked the Moabites the following year. But Hadad came to their assistance, and again he inflicted a severe defeat upon the Midianites, who had to give up their plan of revenge against Moab. This is the beginning of the inveterate enmity between the Moabites and the Midianites. If a single Moabite is caught in the land of Midian, he is killed without mercy, and a Midianite in Moab fares no better. After the death of Hadad, the Edomites installed Samlah of Masrekah as their king, and he reigned eighteen years. It was his desire to take up the cause of Agnias, the old ally of the Edomites, and chastise Zepho for having gone to war with him, but his people, the Edomites, would not permit him to undertake aught that was inimical to their kinsman, and Samlah had to abandon the plan. In the fourteenth year of Samlah's reign, Zepho died, having been king of Kittim for fifty years. His successor was Janus, one of the people of Kittim, who enjoyed an equally long reign. Balaam had made his escape to Egypt after the death of Zepho, and he was received there with great demonstrations of honor by the king and all the nobles, and Pharaoh appointed him to be royal counsellor, for he had heard much about his exceeding great wisdom. In the Edomite kingdom, Samlah was succeeded by Saul of Pethor, a youth of surpassing beauty, whose reign lasted forty years. His successor upon the throne was Baal Hamon, king for thirty-eight years, during which period the Moabites rose up against the Edomites, to whom they had been paying tribute since the time of Hadad, and they succeeded in throwing off the yoke of the stranger. The times were troubled everywhere. Agnias, the king of Africa, died, and also the death of Janus occurred, the king of Kittim. The successors to these two rulers, Asdrubal, the son of Agnias, and Latinus, the king of Kittim, then entered upon a long drawn out war of many years. At first the fortune of war favored Latinus. He sailed to Africa in ships, and inflicted one defeat after another upon Asdrubal, and finally this king of Africa lost his life upon the battlefield. After destroying the canal from Kittim to Africa built many years before by Agnias, Latinus returned to his own country, taking with him as his wife Ushpiziwnah, the daughter of Asdrubal, who was so wondrously beautiful that her countrymen wore her likeness upon their garments. Latinus did not enjoy the fruits of his victory long. Anibal, the younger brother of Asdrubal and his successor in the royal power, went to Kittim in ships and carried on a series of wars lasting eighteen years, in the course of which he killed off eighty thousand of the people of Kittim, not sparing the princes and the nobles. At the end of this protracted period he went back to Africa, and reigned over his people in quiet and peace. The Edomites, during the forty-eight years of the reign of Hadad, the successor of Baal Hamon, fared no better than the people of Kittim. Hadad's first undertaking was to reduce the Moabites again under the sovereignty of Edom, but he had to desist, because he could not offer successful resistance to a newly chosen king of theirs, one of their own people, who enlisted the aid of their kinsmen the Ammonites. The allies commanded a great host, and Hadad was overwhelmed. These wars were followed by others between Hadad of Edom. and Abimenos of Kittim. The latter was the attacking party, and he invaded Seir with a mighty army. The sons of Seir were defeated abjectly, their king Hadad was taken captive, and then executed by Abimenos, and Seir was made a province subject to Kittim and ruled by a governor. Thus ended the independence of the sons of Esau. Henceforth they had to pay tribute to Kittim, over which Abimenos ruled until his death, in the thirty-eighth year of his reign.",

      "content": "As Joseph was returning from the burial of his father in the Cave of Machpelah, he passed the pit into which his brethren had once cast him, and he looked into it, and said, \"Blessed be God who permitted a miracle to come to pass for me here!\" The brethren inferred from these words of gratitude, which Joseph but uttered in compliance with the injunctions of the law, that he cherished the recollection of the evil they had done him, and they feared, that now their father was dead, their brother would requite them in accordance with their deeds. They observed, moreover, that since their father was no more, Joseph had given up the habit of entertaining them at his table, and they interpreted this as a sign of his hatred of them. In reality, it was due to Joseph's respect and esteem for his brethren. \"So long as my father was alive,\" Joseph said to himself, \"he bade me sit at the head of the table, though Judah is king, and Reuben is the first-born. It was my father's wish, and I complied with it. But now it is not seemly that I should have the first seat in their presence, and yet, being ruler of Egypt, I cannot yield my place to any other.\" He thought it best therefore not to have the company of his brethren at his meals. But they, not fathoming his motives, sent Bilhah to him with the dying message of their father, that he was to forgive the transgression and the sin of his brethren. For the sake of the ways of peace they had invented the message; Jacob had said nothing like it. Joseph, on his part, realized that his brethren spoke thus only because they feared he might do harm unto them, and he wept that they should put so little trust in his affection. When they appeared, and fell down before his face, and said, \"Thou didst desire to make one of us a slave unto thyself. Behold, we all are ready to be thy servants,\" he spoke to them gently, and tried to convince them that he harbored no evil design against them. He said: \"Be not afraid, I will do you no harm, for I fear God, and if ye think I failed to have you sit at my table because of enmity toward you, God knows the intentions of my heart, He knows that I acted thus out of consideration for the respect I owe to you.\" Furthermore he said: \"Ye are like unto the dust of the earth, the sand on the sea-shore, and the stars in the heavens. Can I do aught to put these out of the world? Ten stars could effect nothing against one star, how much less can one star effect anything against ten? Do you believe that I have the power of acting contrary to the laws of nature? Twelve hours hath the day, twelve hours the night, twelve months the year, twelve constellations are in the heavens, and also there are twelve tribes! You are the trunk and I am the head—of what use the head without the trunk? It is to my own good that I should treat you with fraternal affection. Before your advent, I was looked upon as a slave in this country—you proved me a man of noble birth. Now, if I should kill you, my claims upon an aristocratic lineage would be shown to be a lie. The Egyptians would say, He was not their brother, they were strangers to him, he but called them his brethren to serve his purpose, and now he hath found a pretext to put them out of the way. Or they would hold me to be a man of no probity. Who plays false with his own kith and kin, how can he keep faith with others? And, in sooth, how can I venture to lay hand upon those whom God and my father both have blessed?\" As Joseph's dealings were kind and gentle with his brethren, so he was the helper and counsellor of the Egyptians, and when Pharaoh departed this life, Joseph being then a man of seventy-one years of age, the king's last wish was that he might be a father unto his son and successor Magron, and administer the affairs of state for him. Some of the Egyptians desired to make Joseph king after the death of Pharaoh, but this plan met with opposition on the part of others. They objected to an alien on the throne, and so the royal title was left to Magron, called Pharaoh, according to the established custom the name given to all the Egyptian kings. But Joseph was made the actual ruler of the land, and though he was only viceroy in Egypt, he reigned as king over the lands outside of Egypt as far as the Euphrates, parts of which Joseph had acquired by conquest. The inhabitants of these countries brought their yearly tribute to him and other presents besides, and thus did Joseph rule for forty years, beloved of all, and respected by the Egyptians and the other nations, and during all that time his brethren dwelt in Goshen, happy and blithe in the service of God. And in his own family circle Joseph was happy also; he lived to act as godfather at the circumcision of the sons of his grandson Machir. His end was premature as compared with that of his brethren; at his death he was younger than any of them at their death. It is true, \"Dominion buries him that exercises it.\" He died ten years before his allotted time, because, without taking umbrage, he had permitted his brethren to call his father his \"servant\" in his presence.",

      "content": "God gives every man the wife he deserves, and so Asenath was worthy of being the helpmeet of Joseph the pious. Her father was Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's magnates, ranking among the most distinguished of them by reason of wisdom, wealth, and station. His daughter was slender like unto Sarah, beautiful like Rebekah, and radiant in appearance like Rachel. Noblemen and princes sued for her hand when she was eighteen years of age. Even Pharaoh's appointed successor, his first-born son, demanded her in marriage, but his father refused to comply with his wish, because he did not consider her a proper wife for one destined to sit upon the throne. The daughter of the Moabite king, he insisted, was a more suitable match for him. But Asenath rejected every proposal of marriage, and avoided all intercourse with men. With seven maidens born the same day as herself, she lived in retirement in a magnificent palace adjoining that of her parents. It happened in the first of the seven years of plenty that Joseph planned to visit the place in which Potiphar resided, and he sent word to him that he would put up with him, at his house. Potiphar was enchanted with the honor in prospect for him, and also with the opportunity it would afford him of bringing about a marriage between Asenath and Joseph. But when he disclosed his plan to his daughter, she rejected it with indignation. \"Why shouldst thou desire to see me united with a vagabond, a slave,\" she cried out, \"one that does not even belong to our nation, but is the son of a Canaanitish herdsman, a fellow that attempted to violate the honor of his mistress, and in punishment for this misdemeanor was thrown into prison, to be liberated thence by Pharaoh for interpreting his dream? Nay, father, never will I become his wife. I am willing to marry the son of Pharaoh, the future ruler and king of Egypt.\" Potiphar promised his daughter not to speak of the plan again. At that moment Joseph's arrival was announced, and Asenath left the presence of her parents and withdrew to her own apartments. Standing by the window, she saw Joseph pass, and she was so transported with his divine beauty and his indescribably noble carriage that she burst into tears, and said: \"Poor, foolish me, what shall I do? I permitted myself to be misled by friends, who told me that Joseph was the son of a Canaanitish shepherd. Now I behold the splendor that emanates from him like unto the splendor of the sun, illuminating our house with his rays. In my audacity and folly I had looked down upon him, and had spoken absurd nonsense against him. I knew not that he was a son of God, as he must be, for among men such beauty as his does not exist. I pray Thee, O God of Joseph, grant me pardon! It was my ignorance that made me speak like a fool. If my father will give me in marriage to Joseph, I will be his forever.\" Meantime Joseph had taken his seat at Potiphar's table, and he observed a maiden looking at him from one of the palace windows. He commanded that she be ordered away, for he never permitted women to gaze at him or come near to him. His supernatural beauty always fascinated the noble Egyptian ladies, and they were untiring in the efforts they made to approach him. But their attempts were vain. He cherished the words of his father Jacob, who had admonished his son to keep aloof from the women of the Gentiles. Potiphar explained to Joseph that the maiden at the window was his virgin daughter, who never permitted men to abide near her; he was the first man she had ever looked upon. The father continued and made the request of Joseph, to allow his daughter to pay him her respects. Joseph granted the favor he desired, and Asenath appeared and greeted him with the words, \"Peace be with thee, thou blessed of God Most High,\" whereunto Joseph returned the salutation, \"Be thou blessed of the Lord, from whom flow all blessings.\" Asenath desired also to kiss Joseph, but he warded off the intimate greeting with the words: \"It is not meet that a God-fearing man, who blesses the living God, and eats the blessed bread of life, who drinks of the blessed cup of immortality and incorruptibility, and anoints himself with the fragrant oil of holiness, should kiss a woman of a strange people, who blesses dead and unprofitable idols, and eats the putrid bread of idolatry, which chokes the soul of man, who drinks the libations of deceit, and anoints herself with the oil of destruction.\" These words uttered by Joseph touched Asenath unto tears. Out of compassion with her, he bestowed his blessing upon her, calling upon God to pour out His spirit over her and make her to become a member of His people and His inheritance, and grant her a portion in the life eternal.",

      "content": "The appearance and the speech of Joseph made so deep an impression upon Asenath that no sooner had she reached her apartment than she divested herself of her robes of state and took off her jewels, and put on sackcloth instead, strewed ashes upon her head, and supplicated God amid tears to grant her pardon for her sins. In this manner she spent seven days and seven nights in her chamber. Not even her seven attendants were permitted to enter her presence during the time of her penance. The morning of the eighth day an angel appeared unto her, and bade her put away her sackcloth and ashes and array herself in state, for this day she had been born anew, he said, to eat the blessed bread of life, to drink of the cup of life immortal, and anoint herself with the oil of life eternal. Asenath was about to set food and drink before her guest, when she perceived a honeycomb of wondrous form and fragrance. The angel explained to her that it had been produced by the bees of Paradise, to serve as food for the angels and the elect of God. He took a small portion of it for himself, and the rest he put into Asenath's mouth, saying: \"From this day forth thy body shall bloom like the eternal flowers in Paradise, thy bones shall wax fat like the cedars thereof, strength inexhaustible shall be thine, thy youth shall never fade, and thy beauty never perish, and thou shalt be like unto a metropolis surrounded by a wall.\" At the request of Asenath, the angel blessed also her seven attendants, with the words, \"May the Lord bless you and make you to be seven pillars in the City of Refuge.\" Thereupon the angel left her, and she saw him ascend heavenward in a chariot of fire drawn by four steeds of fire. Now she knew that she had not been entertaining a human being, but an angel. The celestial messenger had scarcely departed, when a visit from Joseph was announced, and she hastened to array and adorn herself for his reception. When she washed her face, she caught sight of it in the water, and saw it to be of such beauty as never before, so great had been the transformation wrought by the angel. When Joseph came, he did not recognize her. He asked her who she was, whereto she replied, \"I am thy maid-servant Asenath! I have cast away my idols, and this day a visitant came to me from heaven. He gave me to eat of the bread of life and to drink of the blessed cup, and he spake these words unto me, 'I give thee unto Joseph as his affianced wife, that he may be thy affianced husband forever.' And furthermore he said, 'Thy name shall not any more be called Asenath, but thy name shall be City of Refuge, whither the nations shall flee for safety.' And he added, 'I go to Joseph, to tell him all these things that have reference to thee.' Now, my lord, thou knowest whether the man was with thee and spoke to thee in my behalf.\" Joseph confirmed all she had said, and they embraced and kissed each other in token of their betrothal, which they celebrated by a banquet with Potiphar and his wife. The wedding took place later in the presence of Pharaoh, who set a golden crown upon the head of the bridegroom and the bride, gave them his blessing, and made a seven days' feast in their honor, to which he invited the magnates and princes of Egypt and of other countries. And during the seven days of the wedding festivities the people were prohibited, under penalty of death, from doing any manner of work; they all were to join in the celebration of Joseph's marriage.",

      "content": "On the twenty-first day of the second month in the second of the seven years of famine, Jacob came down to Egypt, and his daughter-in-law Asenath visited him. She marvelled not a little at his beauty and strength. His shoulders and his arms were like an angel's, and his loins like a giant's. Jacob gave her his blessing, and with her husband she returned home, accompanied by the sons of Leah, while the sons of the handmaids, remembering the evil they had once done unto Joseph, kept aloof. Levi in particular had conceived a fondness for Asenath. He was especially close to the Living God, for he was a prophet and a sage, his eyes were open, and he knew how to read the celestial books written by the finger of God. He revealed to Asenath that he had seen her future resting-place in heaven, and it was built upon a rock and encompassed by a diamond wall. On their journey they met the son of Pharaoh, his successor to the throne, and he was so transported with Asenath's beauty, that he made the plan of murdering Joseph in order to secure possession of his wife. He summoned Simon and Levi, and by blandishments and promises sought to induce them to put Joseph out of the way. Simon was so enraged that he would have felled him at once, had not his brother Levi, who was endowed with the gift of prophecy, divined his purpose, and frustrated it by stepping upon his foot, while whispering: \"Why art thou so angry, and so wroth with the man? We that fear God may not repay evil with evil.\" Turning to the son of Pharaoh, he told him that nothing would induce them to execute the wickedness he had proposed; rather he advised him not to undertake aught against Joseph, else he would kill him with the sword that had served him in his slaughter of the inhabitants of Shechem. The culprit was seized with frantic alarm, and fell down before Simon and Levi to entreat their mercy. Levi raised him tip, saying, \"Fear not, but abandon thy wicked plan, and harbor no evil design against Joseph.\" Nevertheless the son of Pharaoh did not give up his criminal purpose. He approached the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, and sought to accomplish through them what had failed with Simon and Levi. He called them into his presence, and told them of a conversation between Joseph and Pharaoh that he had overheard. The former had said that he waited but to learn of the death of his father Jacob in order to do away with the sons of the handmaids, because they had been the ones to sell him into slavery. Their wrath excited against Joseph by these words, the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah assented to the proposition of the son of Pharaoh. It was arranged that the latter should kill Pharaoh, the friend of Joseph, while they would fall upon their brother, and put him out of the way. They were furnished with six hundred able warriors and fifty spearmen for the purpose. The first part of the plan, the murder of Pharaoh, failed. The palace guard would not allow even the successor to the throne to enter his father's bedchamber, and he had to depart without having effected his object. Now Dan and Gad gave him the advice to take up his station with fifty archers in a secret place that Asenath had to pass on her homeward journey. Thence he could make a successful attack upon her suite, and gain possession of her. Naphtali and Asher did not care to have anything to do with this hostile enterprise against Joseph, but Dan and Gad forced them into it, insisting that all the sons of the handmaids must stand together as men and repel the danger that threatened them.",

      "content": "From their ambush the forces of the son of Pharaoh fell upon Asenath and her six hundred attendants. They succeeded in hewing down the vanguard, and Asenath had to take to flight. To her alarm she encountered the son of Pharaoh with fifty mounted men. Benjamin, seated in the same chariot with her, came to her rescue, for in spite of his youth he was exceedingly courageous. He descended from the chariot, gathered pebbles, and, throwing them at the son of Pharaoh, struck him on his forehead and inflicted a severe wound. The charioteer aided him by keeping him supplied with pebbles, which he cast at the fifty riders with such expert skill that he slew forty-eight of them with as many missiles. Meantime the sons of Leah arrived on the spot and came to Asenath's aid, for Levi, with his prophetic spirit, had seen what was happening, and summoning his five brothers he had hastened thither. These six attacked the troops in ambush and cut them down. But the danger to Asenath was by no means removed. At this moment the sons of the handmaids threw themselves upon her and Benjamin with drawn swords. It was their intention to kill them both, and flee to cover in the depths of the woods. But as soon as Asenath supplicated God for aid, the swords dropped from the hands of her assailants, and they saw that the Lord was on the side of Asenath. They fell at her feet and entreated her grace. She allayed their anxiety with the words: \"Be courageous and have no fear of your brethren, the sons of Leah. They are God-fearing men. Do but keep yourselves in hiding until their wrath is appeased.\" When the sons of Leah appeared, Asenath fell down before them, and amid tears she adjured them to spare the sons of the handmaids and not repay with evil the evil they had meditated. Simon would not hear of making concessions. He insisted that the measure of their sins was full, and they must pay for them with their lives, for they had been the ones that had sold Joseph into slavery, and brought down untold misfortune upon Jacob and his sons. But Asenath did not leave off, and her urgent petitions won the day. She succeeded in calming the anger of Simon, and in Levi she had a secret ally, for this prophet knew the hiding-place of the sons of the handmaids, and he did not betray it to Simon, lest his wrath be increased at the sight of them. It was also Levi that restrained Benjamin from giving the death blow to the heavily wounded son of Pharaoh. So far from permitting harm to be done to him, he washed his wounds, put him into a chariot, and took him to Pharaoh, who thanked Levi from his heart for his services of lovingkindness. Levi's efforts were vain, three days later the son of Pharaoh died of the wounds inflicted by Benjamin, and from grief over the loss of his first-born Pharaoh followed him soon after, departing this life at the age of one hundred and seventy-seven years. His crown he left to Joseph, who ruled over Egypt for forty-eight years thereafter. He in turn handed the crown on to the grandchild of Pharaoh, an infant in arms at the time of his grandfather's death, toward whom Joseph had acted in a father's stead all his life.",

      "content": "On his death-bed Joseph took an oath of his brethren, and he bade them on their death-bed likewise take an oath of their sons, to carry his bones to Palestine, when God should visit them and bring them up out of the land of Egypt. He said: \"I that am a ruler could take my father's body up to the Holy Land while it was still intact. Of you I do but make the request that ye carry my bones from hence, and you may inter them in any spot in Palestine, for I know that the burial-place of the fathers was appointed to be the tomb only of the three Patriarchs and their three wives.\" Joseph took the oath, to carry his remains along with them when they left Egypt, from his brethren, and not from his sons, to bury him at once in Palestine, for he feared the Egyptians would not give the latter permission to transport his bones even if they recalled what Joseph had been allowed to do with his father's body. They would object that Joseph had been the viceroy, and a wish preferred by one of so high an estate could not be denied. Furthermore, he adjured his brethren not to leave Egypt until a redeemer should appear and announce his message with the words, \"Pakod— I have surely visited you\"—a tradition which Joseph had received from his father, who bad it from Isaac, and Isaac in turn had beard it from Abraham. And he told them that God would redeem Israel through Moses as through the Messiah, in this world as in the world to come, and the Egyptian redemption would begin in Tishri, when Israel would be freed from slave labor, and would be completed in the following Nisan, when they would leave Egypt. Joseph also admonished his brethren to walk in the ways of the Lord, so that they might become worthy of His grace and help. Especially he impressed upon his brethren and his sons the virtue of chastity and a steadfast moral life. He told them all that had happened to him, the hatred of his brethren, the persecutions of the wife of Potiphar, the slander, envy, and malice of the Egyptians, to show how that those who fear the Lord are not forsaken by Him in darkness, or bondage, or tribulation, or distress. \"I was sold into slavery,\" he said, \"but the Lord delivered me; I was thrown into prison, but His strong hand helped me. I was tortured by hunger, but the Lord Himself gave me sustenance. I was alone, and God comforted me. And as for you, if ye will walk in the ways of chastity and purity in patience and humility of heart, the Lord will dwell among you, for He loveth a chaste life, and if you, my children, will observe the commandments of the Lord, He will raise you up here, in this world, and bless you there, in the world to come. If men seek to do evil unto you, pray for them, and you will be delivered from all evil by the Lord. On account of my forbearing patience I received the daughter of my master to wife, and her dowry was a hundred talents of gold, and God gave me also beauty like the beauty of a flower, more than all the children of Jacob, and He preserved me unto mine old age in vigor and beauty, for in all things did I resemble Jacob.\" Joseph continued and told them the visions he had had, in which the future of Israel was revealed to him, and then he closed with the words: \"I know that the Egyptians will oppress you after my death, but God will execute vengeance for your sakes, and He will lead you to the land of promise of your fathers. But ye shall surely carry my bones with you from hence, for if my remains are taken to Canaan, the Lord will be with you in the light, and Behar will be with the Egyptians in the darkness. Also take with you the bones of your mother Zilpah, and bury them near the sepulchre of Bilhah and Rachel.\" These words ended, he stretched out his feet, and slept his last eternal sleep, and the whole of Israel mourned him, and the whole of Egypt was in great grief, for he had been a compassionate friend to the Egyptians, too, and he had done good unto them, and given them wise counsel and assistance in all their undertakings. Joseph's wish, that his bones should rest in the Holy Land, was fulfilled when the Israelites went forth from Egypt, and no less a personage than Moses applied himself to its execution. Such was Joseph's reward for the devotion he had displayed in the interment of his father's body, for he had done all things needful himself, leaving naught to others. Therefore so great a man as Moses busied himself with the realization of Joseph's wish. For three days and three nights preceding the exodus Moses hunted up and down through the land of Egypt for Joseph's coffin, because he knew that Israel could not leave Egypt without heeding the oath given to Joseph. But his trouble was in vain; the coffin was nowhere to be found. Serah, the daughter of Asher, met Moses, tired and exhausted, and in answer to her question about the cause of his weariness, he told her of his fruitless search. Serah took him to the Nile river, and told him that the leaden coffin made for Joseph by the Egyptians had been sunk there after having been scaled up on all sides. The Egyptians had done this at the instigation and with the help of the magicians, who, knowing that Israel could not leave the country without the coffin, had used their arts to put it in a place whence it could not be removed. Moses now took Joseph's cup, and he cut four flat pieces from it, and engraved a lion on one of them, an eagle on the second, a bull on the third, and a human figure on the fourth. He threw the first, with the lion, into the river, saying at the same time, \"Joseph, Joseph, the hour for the redemption of Israel hath arrived, the Shekinah lingers here only for thy sake, the clouds of glory await thy coming. If thou wilt show thyself, well and good; if not, then we are clear from our oath.\" But the coffin did not appear. Then Moses threw the second plate into the water, that with the figure of the eagle, repeating the same words, but again the coffin did not rise from the bed of the Nile, and there it remained, too, when he threw in the third plate bearing the figure of the bull, and called upon Joseph a third time to come forth. But the fourth plate with the human figure and the fourth invocation to Joseph brought the coffin to the surface of the water. Moses seized it, and in joy he bore it off. While Israel had been busy gathering gold and silver from the Egyptians, Moses had been thinking of nothing but Joseph's coffin, and his happiness was great that he had been permitted to fulfil the wish of Joseph. During the forty years of wandering through the desert, the coffin was in the midst of Israel, as a reward for Joseph's promise to his brethren, \"I will nourish you and take care of you.\" God had said, \"As thou livest, for forty years they will take care of thy bones.\" All this time in the desert Israel carried two shrines with them, the one the coffin containing the bones of the dead man Joseph, the other the Ark containing the covenant of the Living God. The wayfarers who saw the two receptacles wondered, and they would ask, \"How doth the ark of the dead come next to the ark of the Ever-living?\" The answer was, \"The dead man enshrined in the one fulfilled the commandments enshrined in the other. In the latter it is written, I am the Lord thy God, and he said, Am I in the place of God? Here it is written, Thou shalt have no other gods before My face, and he said, I fear God. Here it is written, Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, and therefore he did not swear by God, but said, By the life of Pharaoh. Here it is written, Remember the Sabbath day, and he said to the overseer of his palace on Friday, Slay and make ready, meaning for the Sabbath. Here it is written, Honor thy father and thy mother, and he said, when his father desired to send him to his brethren, Here am I, although he knew it was perilous for him to go. Here it is written, Thou shalt not kill, and he refrained from murdering Potiphar when Potiphar's wife urged him to do it. Here it is written, Thou shalt not commit adultery, and he scorned the adulterous proposals of Potiphar's wife. Here it is written, Thou shalt not steal, and he stole nothing from Pharaoh, but gathered up all the money and brought it unto Pharaoh's house. Here it is written, Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor, and he told his father nothing of what his brethren had done to him, though what he might have told was the truth. Here it is written, Thou shalt not covet, and he did not covet Potiphar's wife.\" On their arrival in the Holy Land, the Israelites buried the bones of Joseph in Shechem, for God spake to the tribes, saying, \"From Shechem did ye steal him, and unto Shechem, shall ye return him.\" God, who is so solicitous about the dead bodies of the pious, is even more solicitous about their souls, which stand before Him like angels, and do their service ministering unto Him.",

      "content": "Jacob raised all his sons in the fear of God, and taught them the ways of a pious life, using severity when there was need to make his lessons impressive. He reaped the fruits of his labor, for all his sons were godly men of stainless character. The ancestors of the twelve tribes resembled their fathers in piety, and their acts were no less significant than those of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Like these three, they deserve to be called the Fathers of Israel. God made a covenant with them as He had made with the three Patriarchs, and to this covenant their descendants owe their preservation. The very names of the tribes point to the redemption of Israel. Reuben is so called, because God \"sees\" the affliction of His people; Simon, because He \"hears\" its groaning; Levi, He \"joins\" Himself unto His people when Israel suffers; Judah, Israel will \"thank\" God for its deliverance; Issachar, it will be \"rewarded\" for its suffering with a recompense; Zebulon, God will have a \"dwelling-place\" in Israel; Benjamin, He swore by His \"right hand\" to succor His people; Dan, He will \"judge\" the nation that subjugates Israel; Naphtali, He bestowed the Torah upon Israel, and she drops sweetness like the \"honeycomb\"; Gad, the Lord gave manna unto Israel, and it was like \"coriander\" seed; Asher, all nations will call Israel \"happy\"; and Joseph, because God will \"add\" a second redemption of Israel to the first—redemption from the wicked kingdom at the end as from Egypt in former times. Not only the names of Jacob's sons are significant, but the names of their sons as well. Thus the names of the sons of Issachar express the activities of the tribe known for its learning above all the others. The oldest was called Tola, \"worm\"; as the silk worm is distinguished for its mouth, with which it spins, so also the men of the tribe of Issachar for the wise words of their mouth. The second is Puah, \"madder plant\"; as this plant colors all things, so the tribe of Issachar colors the whole world with its teachings. The third is Jashub, \"the returning one,\" for through the teachings of Issachar Israel will be turned back to its Heavenly Father; and Shimron, the fourth, is \"the observing one,\" to indicate that the tribe of Issachar observes the Torah. The names of the sons of Gad likewise interpret the history of the tribe. During Israel's sojourn in Egypt, it had strayed from the right path, but when Aaron appeared as prophet and monitor, and called unto the Israelites to cast away the abominations of their eyes and forsake the idols of Egypt, they hearkened unto his words. Hence the double name Ozni and Ezbon borne by one of the sons of Gad, for this tribe \"hearkened\" to the word of God, and fulfilled His \"will.\" The grandsons of Asher bear the names Heber and Malchiel, because they were the \"associates\" of kings, and their inheritance yielded \"royal dainties.\" Partly the history of the tribe of Benjamin can be read in the names of its chiefs. It consisted originally of ten divisions, descended from Benjamin's ten sons, but five of them perished in Egypt on account of their ungodly ways, from which no admonition availed to turn them aside. Of the five families remaining, two, the descendants of Bela and those of Ashbel, had always been God-fearing; the others, the Ahiramites, the Shephuphamites, and the Huphamites, repented of their sins, and in accordance with the change in their conduct had been the change in their names. Ehi had become Ahiram, because the breach with the \"Exalted\" One was healed; Muppira was called Shephupham, because they \"afflicted\" themselves in their penance; and Huppim was turned into Hupham, to indicate that they had \"cleansed\" themselves from sin. As a reward for their piety, the family springing from Bela was permitted to have two subdivisions, the Ardites and the Naamites. Their names point them out as men that know well how the fear of God is to be manifested, whose deeds are exceedingly lovely. Naphtali was another tribe of steadfast piety, and the names of his sons testify thereto: Jahzeel, because the tribesmen raised a \"partition wall\" between God and the idols, inasmuch as they trusted in God and contemned the idols; Guni, because God was their \"protection\"; and Jezer and Shillem designate the Naphtalites as men devoted to God with all their hearts.",

      "content": "Two years after the death of Joseph, Reuben fell sick. Feeling that his end was nigh, he called together his sons, his grandsons, and his brethren, to give them his last admonitions from out of the fulness of his experience. He spake: \"Hear, my brethren, and do ye, my children, give ear unto Reuben your father in the commands that I enjoin upon you. And, behold, I adjure you this day by the God of heaven that ye walk not in the follies of youth and the fornications to which I was addicted, and wherewith I defiled the bed of my father Jacob. For I tell you now that for seven months the Lord afflicted my loins with a terrible plague, and if my father Jacob had not interceded for me, the Lord had swept me away. I was twenty years of age when I did what was evil before the Lord, and for seven months I was sick unto death. Then I did penance for seven years in the innermost depths of my soul. Wine and strong drink I drank not, the flesh of animals passed not my lips, dainties I tasted not, because I mourned over my sins, for they were great.\" He admonished those gathered around him to beware of the seven tempter spirits, which are the spirit of fornication, gluttony, strife, love of admiration, arrogance, falsehood, and injustice. He cautioned them especially against unchastity, saying: \"Pay no heed to the glances of a woman, and remain not alone with a married woman, and do not occupy yourselves with the affairs of women. Had I not seen Bilhah bathe in a secluded spot, I had not fallen into the great sin I committed, for after my thoughts had once grasped the nakedness of woman, I could not sleep until I had accomplished the abominable deed. For when our father Jacob went to his father Isaac, while we sojourned in Eder, not far from Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem, Bilhah was drunken with wine, and she lay asleep, uncovered, in her bedchamber, and I entered in and saw her nakedness and committed the sin, and I went out again, leaving her asleep. But an angel of God revealed my impious act to my father Jacob at once. He came back and mourned over me, and never again did he approach Bilhah. Unto the very last day of his life, I had not the assurance to look my father in the face or to speak to my brethren regarding my disgrace, and even now my conscience tortures me on account of my sin. Nevertheless my father spake words of comfort to me, and prayed to God in my behalf, that the wrath of the Lord might depart from me, as He showed me.\" Reuben admonished his children impressively to join themselves to Levi, \"because he will know the law of the Lord,\" he said, \"and he will give ordinances for judgment, and bring sacrifices for all Israel, until the consummation of the times, as the anointed high priest of whom the Lord spake.\" After announcing his last will to his sons, Reuben departed this life at the age of one hundred and twenty-five years. His body was laid in a coffin until his sons bore it away from Egypt, and carried it up to Hebron, where they buried it in the Double Cave.",

      "title": "Simon's Admonition Against Envy",
      "content": "As Reuben confessed his sin upon his death-bed, and warned his children and his family to be on their guard against unchastity, the vice that had brought about his fall, so Simon, when he was about to die, assembled his sons around him, and confessed the sin he had committed. He had been guilty of boundless envy of Joseph, and he spoke: \"I was the second son begotten by my father Jacob, and my mother Leah called me Simon, because the Lord had heard her prayer. I waxed strong, and shrank from no manner of deed, and I was afraid of naught, for my heart was hard, and my liver unyielding, and my bowels without mercy. And in the days of my youth I was jealous of Joseph, for our father loved him more than all the rest of us, and I resolved to kill him. For the prince of temptation sent the spirit of jealousy to take possession of me, and it blinded me so that I did not consider Joseph to be my brother, and I spared not even my father Jacob. But his God and the God of his fathers sent His angel and saved him out of my hands. When I went to Shechem to fetch ointment for the herds, and Reuben was in Dothan, where all our supplies and stores were kept, our brother Judah sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites. On his return, when he heard what had happened, Reuben was very sad, for he had been desirous of saving Joseph and bringing him back to our father. But as for me, my wrath was enkindled against Judah, that he had let him escape alive. My anger abode with me all of five months. But the Lord restrained me from using the power of my hands, for my right hand withered for the length of seven days. Then I knew that what had happened was for the sake of Joseph. I repented and prayed to God to restore my hand and withhold me henceforth from all sorts of defilement, envy, and folly. For two years I gave myself up to fasting and the fear of God, for I perceived that redemption from jealousy could come only through the fear of God. My father, seeing me downcast, asked to know the cause of my sadness, and I replied that I was suffering with my liver, but in truth I was mourning more than all my brethren, seeing that I had been the cause of Joseph's sale. And when we went down into Egypt, and Joseph bound me as a spy, I was not grieved, for I knew in my heart that my suffering was just retribution. But Joseph was good, the spirit of God dwelt within him. Compassionate and merciful as he was, he bore me no resentment for my evil deeds toward him, but he loved me with the same love he showed the others. He paid due honor to us all, and gave us gold, and cattle, and produce. And now, my dear children, do ye love one another, each one his brother, with a clean heart, and remove the spirit of jealousy from the midst of you.\" Like Reuben, so also Simon adjured his sons to beware of unchastity, for this vice is the mother of all evil. It separates man from God, and abandons him to Behar. These were the closing words of his exhortation: \"In the writings of Enoch I saw that your sons would be corrupted through unchastity, and they would maltreat the sons of Levi with the sword. But they will not be able to do aught against Levi, for the war he will wage is the war of the Lord, and he will vanquish all your armies. As a small remnant you will be scattered among Levi and Judah, and none among you will rise to be a judge or a king of our people, as, my father Jacob prophesied in his blessing.\" Having completed his admonitions to his sons, Simon passed away and was gathered to his fathers, at the age of one hundred and twenty years. His sons placed him in a coffin made of imperishable wood, so that they might carry his bones to Hebron, as they did, in secret, during the war between the Egyptians and the Canaanites. Thus did all the tribes during the war; they took the remains each of its founder from Egypt to Hebron. Only the bones of Joseph remained in Egypt until the Israelites went out of the land, for the Egyptians guarded them in their royal treasure chambers. Their magicians had warned them that whenever Joseph's bones should be removed from Egypt, a great darkness would envelop the whole land, and it would be a dire misfortune for the Egyptians, for none would be able to recognize his neighbor even with the light of a lamp.",

      "content": "When it was disclosed to Levi that he was about to die, he gathered all his children around him, to tell them the story of his life, and he also prophesied unto them what they would do, and what would happen to them until the judgment day. He spoke: \"When we were pasturing the flocks in Abel-Meholah, the spirit of understanding of the Lord came upon me, and I saw all mankind, how they corrupt their ways, and that injustice builds up walls for herself, and impiety sits enthroned upon the towers. And I fell to grieving over the generations of men, and I prayed to the Lord to save me. Sleep enshrouded me, and I beheld a tall mountain, and lo! the heavens opened, and an angel of God addressed me, and said: 'Levi, enter!' \"I entered the first heaven, and I saw a great sea hanging there, and farther on I saw a second heaven, brighter and more resplendent than the first. I said to the angel, 'Why is this so?' And the angel said to me, 'Marvel not at this, for thou shalt see another heaven, brilliant beyond compare, and when thou hast ascended thither, thou shalt stand near the Lord, and thou shalt be His minister, and declare His mysteries to men; and of the Lord's portion shall be thy life, and He shall be thy field and vineyard and fruits and gold and silver.' \"Then the angel explained the uses of the different heavens to me, and all that happens in each, and he proclaimed the judgment day. He opened the gates of the third heaven, where I beheld the holy Temple, and God seated upon the Throne of Glory. The Lord spake to me: 'Levi, upon thee have I bestowed the blessing of the priesthood, until I come and dwell in the midst of Israel.' Then the angel carried me back to earth, and gave me a shield and a sword, saying, 'Execute vengeance upon Shechem for Dinah, and I will be with thee, for the Lord hath sent me.' I asked the angel what his name was, and he replied: 'I am the angel that intercedes for the people of Israel, that it may not be destroyed utterly, for every evil spirit attacks it.' \"When I awoke, I betook myself to my father, and on the way, near Gebal, I found a brass shield, such as I had seen in my dream. Then I advised my father and my brother Reuben to bid the sons of Hamor circumcise themselves, for I was quivering with rage on account of the abominable deed they had done. I slew Shechem first of all, and then Simon slew Hamor, and all my other brothers came out and destroyed the whole city. Our father took this in ill part, and in his blessing he remembered our conduct. Although we did a wrong thing in acting thus against his wishes, yet I recognized it to be the judgment of God upon the people of Shechem on account of their sins, and I said to my father: 'Be not wroth, my lord, for God will exterminate the Canaanites through this, and he will give the land to thee and to thy seed after thee. Henceforth Shechem will be called the city of imbeciles, for as a fool is mocked at, so have we made a mockery of them.' \"When we journeyed to Beth-lehem, and had been abiding there for seventy days, another vision was vouchsafed me, like unto the former. I saw seven men clad in white, and they spake to me, saying: 'Rise up, and array thyself in the priestly garments, set the crown of righteousness upon thy head, and put on the ephod of understanding, and the robe of truth, and the mitre-plate of faith, and the mitre of dignity, and the shoulderpieces of prophecy.' And each of the men brought a garment unto me and invested me therewith, and spake: 'Henceforth be the priest of the Lord, thou and thy seed unto eternity. And ye shall eat all that is lovely to look upon, and the table of the Lord thy descendants will appropriate for themselves, and from them will come high priests, judges, and scholars, for all that is holy will be guarded by their mouth.' \"Two days after I was visited by this dream, Judah and I repaired to our grandfather Isaac, who blessed me in accordance with the words I had heard. Jacob also had a vision, and he saw, too, that I was appointed to be the priest of God, and through me he set apart a tenth of his possessions unto the Lord. And when we established ourselves in Hebron, the residence of Isaac, our grandfather taught me the law of the priesthood, and admonished me to hold myself aloof from unchastity. At the age of twenty-eight years I took Milcah to wife, and she bore me a son, and I named him Gershom, because we were strangers in the land. But I perceived he would not be in the first ranks of men. My second son was born unto me in my thirty-fifth year, and he saw the light of the world at sunrise, and I beheld him in a vision standing among the proud of the assembly, and therefore I gave him the name Kohath. The third son my wife bore me in the fortieth year of my life, and I called his name Merari, because bitter had been her travail in bearing him. My daughter Jochebed was born in Egypt, when I was sixty-three years old, and I called her thus because I was known honorably among my brethren in those days. And in my ninetyfourth year, Amram took Jochebed to wife, he that was born on the same day with her.\" Thereupon Levi admonished his children to walk in the ways of the Lord, and fear Him with all their heart, and he told them what he had learnt from the writings of Enoch, that his descendants would sin against the Lord in times to come, and they would suffer the Divine punishment for their transgression, and then God would raise up a new priest, unto whom all the words of the Lord would be revealed. His last words were: \"And now, my children, ye have heard all I have to say. Choose, now, light or darkness, the law of the Lord or the works of Beliar.\" And his sons made answer, \"Before the Lord we will walk according to His law.\" Then Levi spake, \"The Lord is witness and the angels are witnesses, I am witness and ye are witnesses, concerning the word of your mouth.\" And his sons replied, \"We are witnesses.\" Thus Levi ceased to admonish his sons. He stretched out his feet, and was gathered unto his fathers, at the age of one hundred and thirty-seven years, a greater age than any of his brethren attained.",

      "content": "The last words addressed by Judah to his sons were the following: \"I was the fourth son begotten by my father, and my mother called me Judah, saying, 'I thank the Lord that He hath given me a fourth son.' I was zealous in my youth and obedient to my father in all things. When I grew up to manhood, he blessed me, saying, 'Thou wilt be king, and wilt prosper in all thy ways.' The Lord granted me His grace in whatever I undertook, in the field and in the house. I could speed as swiftly as the hind, and overtake it, and prepare a dish of it for my father. A deer I could catch on the run, and all the animals of the valley. A wild mare I could outstrip, hold it, and bridle it. A lion I slew, and snatched a kid from its jaws. A bear I caught by the paw, and flung it adown the cliff, and it lay beneath crushed. I could keep pace with the wild boar, and overtake it, and as I ran I seized it, and tore it to pieces. A leopard sprang at my dog in Hebron, and I grasped its tail, and hurled it away from me, and its body burst on the coast at Gaza. A wild steer I found grazing in the field. I took it by its horns, swung it round and round until it was stunned, and then I cast it to the ground and killed it.\" Judah continued and told his children of his heroism in the wars that the sons of Jacob had waged with the kings of Canaan and with Esau and his family. In all these conflicts he bore a distinguished part, beyond the achievements of the others. His father Jacob was free from all anxiety when Judah was with his brethren in their combats, because he had had a vision showing him an angel of strength standing at the side of Judah on all his ways. Judah did not conceal his shortcomings, either. He confessed how drunkenness and passion had betrayed him first into marriage with a Canaanitish woman, and then into improper relations with his daughter-in-law Tamar. He said to his children: \"Do not walk after the desire of your hearts, and vaunt not the valiant deeds of your youth. This, too, is evil in the eyes of the Lord. For while I boasted that the face of a beautiful woman had never allured me in the wars, and reviled my brother Reuben for his transgression with Bilhah, the spirit of passion and unchastity gained possession of me, and I took Bath-shua to wife, and trespassed with Tamar, though she was the affianced of my son. First I said to Bath-shua's father, 'I will take counsel with my father Jacob, to know whether I should marry thy daughter,' but he was a king, and he showed me an untold heap of gold accredited to his daughter, and he adorned her with the magnificence of women, in gold and pearls, and he bade her pour the wine at the meal. The wine turned my eyes awry, and passion darkened my heart. In mad love for her, I violated the command of the Lord and the will of my father, and I took her to wife. The Lord gave me a recompense according to the counsel of my heart, for I had no joy in the sons she bore me. \"And now, my children, I pray you, do not intoxicate yourselves with wine, for wine twists the understanding away from the truth, and confuses the sight of the eyes. Wine led me astray, so that I felt no shame before the throngs of people in the city, and I turned aside and went in to Tamar in the presence of them, and committed a great sin. And though a man be a king, if he leads an unchaste life, he loses his kingship. I gave Tamar my staff, which is the stay of my tribe, and my girdle-cord, which is power, and my signetdiadem, which is the glory of my kingdom. I did penance for all this, and unto old age I drank no wine, and ate no flesh, and knew no sort of pleasure. Wine causes the secret things of God and man to be revealed unto the stranger. Thus did I disclose the commands of the Lord and the mysteries of my father Jacob to the Canaanite woman Bath-shua, though God had forbidden me to betray them. I also enjoin you not to love gold, and not to look upon the beauty of women, for through money and through beauty I was led astray to Bath-shua the Canaanite. I know that my stock will fall into misery through these two things, for even the wise men among my sons will be changed by them, and the consequence will be that the kingdom of Judah will be diminished, the domain that the Lord gave me as a reward for my obedient conduct toward my father, for never did I speak in contradiction of him, but I did all things according to his words. And Isaac, my father's father, blessed me with the blessing that I should be ruler in Israel, and I know that the kingdom will arise from me. In the books of Enoch the just I read all the evil that ye will do in the latter days. Only beware, my children, of unchastity and greed, for love of gold leads to idolatry, causing men to call them gods that are none, and dethroning the reason of man. On account of gold I lost my children, and had I not mortified my flesh, and humbled my soul, and had not my father Jacob offered up prayers for me, I had died childless. But the God of my fathers, the merciful and gracious One, saw that I had acted unwittingly, for the ruler of deception had blinded me, and I was ignorant, being flesh and blood, and corrupt through sins, and in the moment when I considered myself invincible, I recognized my weakness.\" Then Judah revealed to his sons, in clear, brief words, the whole history of Israel until the advent of the Messiah, and his final speech was: \"My children, observe the whole law of the Lord; in it is hope for all that keep His ways. I die this day at the age of one hundred and nineteen years before your eyes. None shall bury me in a costly garment, nor shall ye cut my body to embalm it, but ye shall carry me to Hebron.\" Having spoken these words, Judah sank into death.",

      "content": "When Issachar felt his end approach, he summoned his sons, and he said to them: \"Hearken, my children, unto your father Issachar, and listen to the words of him that is beloved of the Lord. I was born unto Jacob as his fifth son, as a reward for the dudaim. Reuben brought the dudaim from the field. They were fragrant apples, which grew in the land of Haran upon an eminence below a gully. Rachel met Reuben, and she took the dudaim away from him. The lad wept, and his cries brought his mother Leah to his side, and she addressed Rachel thus: 'Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband? and wouldst thou take away my son's dudaim also?' And Rachel said, 'See, Jacob shall be thine to-night for thy son's dudaim.' But Leah insisted, 'Jacob is mine, and I am the wife of his youth,' whereupon Rachel, 'Be not boastful and overweening. To me he was betrothed first, and for my sake he served our father fourteen years. Thou art not his wife, thou wast taken to him by cunning instead of me, for our father deceived me, and put me out of the way the night of thy nuptials, so that Jacob could not see me. Nevertheless, give me the dudaim, and thou mayest have Jacob for a night.' \"Then Leah bore me, and I was called Issachar, on account of the reward Rachel had given to my mother. At that time an angel of the Lord appeared to Jacob, and he spoke: 'Rachel will bear only two sons, for she rejected the espousal of her husband, and chose continence! But Leah bore six sons, for the Lord knew that she desired to be with her husband, not because she was prompted by the evil inclination, but for the sake of children. Rachel's prayer also was fulfilled, on account of the dudaim, for although she desired to eat of the apples, she did not touch them, but put them in the house of the Lord, and gave them to the priest of the Most High that was in those days. \"When I grew up, my children, I walked in the integrity of my heart, and I became a husbandman, cultivating the land for my father and my brethren, and I gathered the fruit from the fields in their due time. My father blessed me, because he saw that I walked in singleness of heart. I was not married to a wife until I was thirty years old, for the hard work I did consumed my strength, and I had no desire unto woman, but, overwhelmed by fatigue, I would sink into sleep. My father was well pleased at all times with my rectitude. If my work was crowned with good results, I brought the firstfruits of my labor to the priest of the Lord, the next harvest went to my father, and then I thought of myself. The Lord doubled the possessions in my hand, and Jacob knew that God aided me for the sake of my singleness of heart, for in my sincerity I gave of the produce of the land to the poor and the needy. \"And now hearken unto me, my children, and walk in singleness of heart, for upon it resteth the favor of the Lord at all times. The simple man longeth not for gold, he doth not defraud his neighbor, he hath no desire for meats and dainties of many kinds, he careth not for sumptuous dress, he hopeth not for long life, he waiteth only upon the will of God. The spirits of deception have no power over him, for he looketh not upon the beauty of woman, lest he defile his understanding with corruption. Jealousy cometh not into his thoughts, envy doth not sear his soul, and insatiable greed doth not make him look abroad for rich gain. Now, then, my children, observe the law of the Lord, attain to simplicity, and walk in singleness of heart, without meddling with the affairs of others. Love the Lord and love your neighbors, have pity upon the poor and the feeble, bow your backs to till the ground, occupy yourselves with work upon the land, and bring gifts unto the Lord in gratitude. For the Lord hath blessed you with the best of the fruits of the field, as he hath blessed all the saints from Abel down to our day. \"Know, my children, that in the latter time your sons will abandon the paths of probity, and will be ruled by greed. They will forsake rectitude and practice craft, they will depart from the commands of the Lord and follow after Beliar, they will give up husbandry and pursue their evil plans, they will be scattered among the heathen and serve their enemies. Tell this unto your children, so that, if they sin, they may repent speedily, and return to the Lord, for He is merciful, and He will take them out to bring them back unto their land. \"I am one hundred and twenty-two years old, and I can discern no sin in myself. Save my wife, I have known no woman. I was guilty of no unchastity through the lifting up of eyes. I drank no wine, that I might not be led astray, I did not covet what belonged to my neighbor, guile had no place in my heart, lies did not pass my lips. I sighed along with all that were heavy-laden, and to the poor I gave my bread. I loved the Lord with all my might, and mankind I also loved. Do ye likewise, my children, and all the spirits of Beliar will flee from you, no deed done by the wicked will have power over you, and ye will vanquish all the wild beasts, for ye have with you the Lord of heaven.\" And Issachar bade his children carry him up to Hebron, and bury him there by his fathers in the Cave, and he stretched out his feet, and fell into the sleep of eternity, full of years, healthy of limb, and in the possession of all his faculties.",

I am conscious of no sin in me, and I remember no wrong done by me, unless it be the unwitting sin committed against Joseph, in that I did not, out of consideration for my brethren, disclose to my father what had happened to his favorite son, though in secret I mourned exceedingly. I feared my brethren, because they had agreed that he who betrayed the secret should be slain with the sword. When they planned to kill Joseph, I besought them amid tears not to sin thus. \"And now, my children, hearken unto me. I exhort you to observe the commands of the Lord, and have mercy upon your neighbors, and act compassionately, not only toward men, but also toward dumb brutes. For on account of my mercifulness the Lord blessed me; all my brethren fell sick at one time or another, but I escaped without any illness. Also the sons of my brethren had to endure disease, and they were nigh unto death for the sake of Joseph, because they had no pity in their hearts. But my sons were preserved in perfect health, as ye well know. And when I was in Canaan, catching fish at the shores of the sea for my father Jacob, many were drowned in the waters of the sea, but I came away unharmed. For ye must know that I was the first to build a boat for rowing upon the sea, and I plied along the coasts in it, and caught fish for my father's household, until we went down into Egypt. Out of pity I would share my haul with the poor stranger, and if he was sick or well on in years, I would prepare a savory dish for him, and I gave unto each according to his needs, sympathizing with him in his distress and having pity upon him. Therefore the Lord brought numerous fish to my nets, for he that gives aught to his neighbor, receives it back from the Lord with great increase. For five years I fished in the summer, and in the winter I pastured the flocks with my brethren. \"Now, my children, have pity and compassion on all men, that the Lord may have pity and compassion on you, for in the measure in which man has mercy with his fellow-men, God has mercy with him. When we came down into Egypt, Joseph did not visit upon us the wrong he had suffered. Take him as your model, and remember not a wrong done unto you, else unity is rent asunder, and the bonds of kinship are torn, and the soul is disquieted. Observe the water! If it runs on undivided, it carries down stone, wood, and sand along with it. But if it is divided and flows through many channels, the earth sucks it up, and it loses its force. If you separate, one from the other, you will be like divided waters. Be not cleft into two heads, for all that the Lord hath made has but one head. He has given two shoulders unto his creatures, two hands, and two feet, but all these organs obey one head.\" Zebulon ended his exhortation unto unity with an account of the divisions in Israel, whereof he had read in the writings of the fathers, that they would come about in future days, and bring sore suffering upon Israel. However, he spoke encouraging words to his children, saying: \"Be not grieved over my death, and do not lose heart at my departure from you, for I shall arise again in the midst of you, and I shall live joyously among the people of my tribe, those who observe the law of the Lord. As for the godless, the Lord will bring everlasting fire down upon them, and exterminate them unto all generations. Now I hasten hence unto my eternal rest with my fathers. But ye, fear ye the Lord your God with all your might all the days of your life.\" Having made an end of saying these words, he sank into the sleep of death, and his sons put him into a coffin, wherein they carried him up to Hebron later, to bury him there next to his fathers.",

The spirit of envy and boastfulness goaded me on, saying, 'Thou, too, art the son of Jacob,' and one of the spirits of Behar stirred me up, saying, 'Take this sword, and slay Joseph, for once he is dead thy father will love thee.' It was the spirit of anger that was seeking to persuade me to crush Joseph, as a leopard crunches a kid between its teeth. But the God of our father Jacob did not deliver him into my hand, to let me find him alone, and He did not permit me to execute this impious deed, that two tribes in Israel might not be destroyed. \"And now, my children, I am about to die, and I tell it unto you in truth, if you take not heed against the spirit of lies and anger, and if ye love not truth and generosity, you will perish. The spirit of anger casts the net of error around its victim, and it blinds his eyes, and the spirit of lies warps his mind, and clouds his vision. Evil is anger, it is the grave of the soul. Desist from anger and hate lies, that the Lord may dwell among you, and Behar flee from your presence. Speak the truth each unto his neighbor, and you will not fall into anger and trouble, but you will be at peace, and the Lord of peace you will have with you, and no war will vanquish you. \"I speak thus, for I know that in the latter days you will fall off from God, and you will kindle the wrath of Levi, and rise in rebellion against Judah, but you will not accomplish aught against them, for the angel of the Lord is their guide, and Israel will perish through them. And if you turn recreant to the Lord, you will execute every kind of evil thing, and do the abominations of the heathen, committing unchastity with the wives of the godless, while the tempter spirits are at work among you. Therefore you will be carried away into captivity, and in the lands of exile you will suffer all the plagues of Egypt and all the tribulations of the heathen. But when you return to the Lord, you will find mercy. He will take you into His sanctuary, and grant you peace. \"And now, my children, fear the Lord, and be on your guard against Satan and his spirits. Keep aloof from every evil deed, cast anger away from you and every sort of lie, love truth and forbearance, and what ye have heard from your father, tell unto your children. Avoid all manner of unrighteousness, cling to the integrity of the law of the Lord, and bury me near my fathers.\" Having spoken these words, he kissed his children, and fell asleep.",

      "title": "Naphtali's Dreams Of The Division Of The Tribes",
      "content": "In the hundred and thirty-second year of his life, Naphtali invited all his children to a banquet. The next morning when he awoke, he told them that he was dying, but they would not believe him. He, however, praised the Lord, and assured them again that his death was due after the banquet of the day before. Then he addressed his last words to his children: \"I was born of Bilhah, and because Rachel had acted with cunning, and had given Jacob Bilhah instead of herself, I was called Naphtali. Rachel loved me, for I was born upon her knees, and while I was still very young, she was in the habit of kissing me and saying, 'O that I had a brother unto thee from mine own body, one in thine image.' Therefore Joseph resembled me in all respects, in accordance with Rachel's prayer. My mother Bilhah was a daughter of Rotheus, a brother of Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, and she was born the same day as Rachel. As for Rotheus, he was of the family of Abraham, a Chaldean, God-fearing, and a free man of noble birth, and when he was taken captive, he was bought by Laban and married to his slave Aina. She bore Rotheus a daughter, and he called her Zilpah, after the name of the village in which he was taken captive. His second daughter he called Bilhah, saying, 'My daughter is impetuous,' for hardly was she born when she hastened to suckle. \"I was fleet of foot like a deer, and my father Jacob appointed me to be his messenger, and in his blessing he called me a hind let loose. As the potter knows the vessel he fashions, how much it is to hold, and uses clay accordingly, so the Lord makes the body in conformity with the soul, and to agree with the capacity of the body He plans the soul. The one corresponds to the other down to the third of a hairbreadth, for the whole of creation was made by weight, and measure, and rule. And as the potter knows the use of every vessel he fashions, so the Lord knows the body of His creature, unto what point it will be steadfast in the good, and at what point it will fall into evil ways. Now, then, my children, let your conduct be well-ordered unto good in the fear of God, do naught that is ill-regulated or untimely, for though ye tell your eye to hear, it yet cannot, and as little can ye do deeds of light while you abide in darkness.\" Furthermore Naphtali said unto his children: \"I give you no command concerning my silver, or my gold, or any other possession that I bequeath to you. And what I command you is not a hard matter, which you cannot do, but I speak unto you concerning an easy thing, which you can execute.\" Then his sons answered, and said, \"Speak, father, for we are listening to thy words.\" Naphtali continued: \"I give you no commandment except regarding the fear of God, that you should serve Him and follow after Him.\" Then the sons of Naphtali asked: \"Wherefore does He require our service?\" and he replied, saying: \"He needs no creature, but all creatures need Him. Nevertheless He hath not created the world for naught, but that men should fear Him, and none should do unto his neighbor what he would not have others do unto him.\" His sons asked again, \"Father, hast thou observed that we strayed from the ways of the Lord to the right or to the left?\" Naphtali replied: \"God is witness, and so am I witness for you, that it is as you say. But I fear regarding future times, that you may depart from the ways of the Lord, and follow after the idols of the stranger, and walk in the statutes of the heathen peoples, and join yourselves unto the sons of Joseph instead of the sons of Levi and Judah.\" The sons of Naphtali spoke, \"What reason hast thou for commanding this thing unto us?\" Naphtali: \"Because I know that the sons of Joseph will one day turn recreant to the Lord, the God of their fathers, and it is they that will lead the sons of Israel into sin, and cause them to be driven away from their inheritance, their beautiful land, to a land that is not ours, even as it was Joseph that brought the Egyptian bondage down upon us. \"I will tell ye, my children, the vision I had while I was yet a shepherd of flocks. I saw my brethren pasturing the herds with me, and our father approached, and said: 'Up, my sons, each one take what he can in my presence!' We answered, and said to him, 'What shall we take? We see nothing but the sun, the moon, and the stars.' Then our father said: 'These shall ye take!' Levi, hearing this, snatched up an ox-goad, sprang up to the sun, sat upon him, and rode. Judah did likewise. He jumped up to the moon, and rode upon her. And the other nine tribes did the same, each rode upon his star or his planet in the heavens. Joseph remained behind alone on the earth, and our father Jacob said to him, 'My son, why hast thou not done like thy brethren?' Joseph answered, 'What right have men born of woman to be in the heavens, seeing that in the end they must stay on earth?' While Joseph was speaking thus, a tall steer appeared before him. He had great pinions like the wings of the stork, and his horns were as long as those of the reem. Jacob urged his son, 'Up, Joseph, mount the steer!' Joseph did as his father bade him, and Jacob went his way. For the space of two hours Joseph displayed himself upon the steer, sometimes galloping, sometimes flying, until he reached Judah. Then Joseph unfolded the standard in his hand, and began to rain blows down upon Judah with it, and when his brother demanded the reason for this treatment, he said, 'Because thou hast twelve rods in thine hand, and I have but one. Give thine to me, and peace shall prevail between us!' But Judah refused to do his bidding, and Joseph beat him until he dropped ten rods, and only two remained in his clutch. Joseph now invited his brethren to abandon Judah and follow after him. They all did thus, except Benjamin, who stayed true to Judah. Levi was grieved over the desertion of Judah, and he descended from the sun. Toward the end of the day a storm broke out, and it scattered the brethren, so that no two were together. When I gave an account of my vision to my father Jacob, he said, 'It is but a dream, it can neither help nor harm.' \"A short while thereafter another vision was revealed to me. I saw all of us together with our father at the shores of the sea, and a ship appeared in the midst of the sea, and it had neither sailors nor other crew. Our father spake, 'Do you see what I see?' And when we answered that we did, he commanded us to follow him. He took off his clothes, and sprang into the sea, and we sprang after him. Levi and Judah were the first to scale the side of the ship. Our father cried after them, 'See what is written upon the mast,' for there is no ship that does not bear the name of the owner upon the mast. Levi and Judah scrutinized the writing, and what they read was this, 'This ship and all the treasures therein belong unto the son of Barachel.' Jacob thanked God for having blessed him, not only on land, but also upon the sea, and he said to us, 'Stretch forth your hands, and whatsoever each one seizes shall be his!' Levi caught hold of the big mast, Judah of the second mast, next to Levi's, and the other brethren, with the exception of Joseph, took the oars, and Jacob himself seized the two rudders, wherewith to guide the ship. He bade Joseph take an oar, too, but he refused to do his father's bidding, and Jacob gave him one of the rudders. After our father had instructed us each one in what we had to do, he disappeared, whereupon Joseph took possession of the second rudder, too. All went smoothly for a time, as long as Judah and Joseph acted together in harmony with each other, and Judah kept Joseph informed in what direction to steer. But a quarrel broke out between them, and Joseph did not guide the vessel in the way his father had commanded him, and Judah attempted to direct him, and the vessel was wrecked upon a rock. Levi and Judah descended from the masts, and likewise the other brethren left the ship and escaped to the shore. At this moment Jacob appeared, and he found us scattered in all directions, and we reported to him how Joseph had caused the vessel to run aground, because he had refused, out of jealousy of Judah and Levi, to steer it according to their instructions. Then Jacob asked us to show him the spot where we had lost the ship, of which only the masts were visible above the water. He emitted a whistle summoning us all, and he swam out into the water, and raised the vessel as before. Turning to Joseph, he spake thus, 'My son, never do that again, never permit jealousy of thy brethren to master thee. Nearly it happened that all thy brethren perished because of thee.' \"When I told my father what I had seen in this vision, he clasped his hands, and tears flowed from his eyes, and be said: 'My son, for that the vision was doubled unto thee twice, I am dismayed, and I shudder for my son Joseph. I loved him more than all of you, but by reason of his perverseness ye will be carried away into captivity, and scattered among the nations. Thy first and thy second vision had the same meaning, the vision is one.' \"Therefore, my sons, I command you not to join yourselves unto the sons of Joseph, but ye shall join yourselves unto the sons of Levi and Judah. I tell you, too, that my inheritance shall be of the best of Palestine, the middle of the earth. You will eat, and the delectable gifts of my portion will satisfy you. But I warn you not to kick in your prosperity and not to become perverse, resisting the commands of God, who satisfies you with the best of His land, and not to forget your God, whom your father Abraham chose when the families of the earth were divided in the days of Peleg. The Lord descended with seventy angels, at their head Michael, and he commanded them to teach the seventy languages unto the seventy families of Noah. The angels did according to the behest of God, and the holy Hebrew language remained only in the house of Shem and Eber, and in the house of their descendant Abraham. On this day of teaching languages, Michael came to each nation separately, and told it the message with which God had charged him, saying: 'I know the rebellion and the confusion ye have enacted against God. Now, make choice of him whom you will serve, and whom will you have as your mediator in heaven?' Then spake Nimrod the wicked, 'In my eyes there is none greater than he that taught me the language of Cush.' The other nations also answered in words like these, each one designated its angel. But Abraham said: 'I choose none other than Him that spake and the world was. In Him I will have faith, and my seed forever and ever.' Thenceforth God put every nation in the care of its angel, but Abraham and his seed He kept for Himself. \"Therefore I adjure you not to go astray and serve other gods beside Him whom our fathers made choice of. You can perceive somewhat of His power in the creation of man. From head to foot is man wonderfully made. With his ears he hears, with his eyes he sees, with his brain he comprehends, with his nose he smells, with the tubes of his throat he utters sounds, with his gullet he swallows food, with his tongue he articulates, with his mouth he forms words, with his hands he does his work, with his heart he meditates, with his spleen he laughs, with his liver he waxes angry, with his stomach he crushes his food, with his feet he walks, with his lungs he breathes, and with his kidneys he makes resolves, and none of his organs undergoes a change in function, each performs its own. Therefore it behooves man to take to heart who it is that hath created him, and who hath developed him from a foul-smelling drop in the womb of woman, who hath brought him to the light of the world, who hath given sight to his eyes, and who hath bestowed the power of motion upon his feet, who maketh him to stand upright, who hath infused the breath of life into him, and who hath imparted of His own pure spirit unto him. Happy the man, therefore, that polluteth not the holy spirit of God within him by doing evil deeds, and well for him if he returns it to his Creator as he received it.\" After Naphtali had charged his children thus, and with many other lessons like these, he enjoined them to carry his remains to Hebron, to be buried there near his fathers. Then he ate and drank with rejoicing, covered his face, and died, and his sons did according to all that their father Naphtali had commanded them.",

      "content": "In the hundred and twenty-fifth year of his life Gad assembled his sons, and he spake to them: \"I am the ninth son of Jacob, and I was a valiant shepherd of the flocks. I guarded the herds, and when a lion or any other wild beast approached, I pursued it, gripped it by the foot, flung it a stone's throw from me, and killed it thus. Once, for a space of thirty days, Joseph tended the flocks with us, and when he returned to our father, he told him that the sons of Zilpah and Bilhah slaughtered the best of the herds, and used the flesh without the knowledge of Reuben and Judah. He had seen me snatch a lamb out of the jaws of a bear, kill the bear, and slaughter the lamb, for it was too badly injured to live. I was wroth with Joseph for his talebearing, until he was sold into Egypt. I would neither look upon him nor hear aught about him, for to our very faces he, blamed us, because we had eaten the lamb without seeking the permission of Judah first. And whatever Joseph told our father, he believed. \"Now I confess my sin, that ofttimes I longed to kill him, for I hated him from the bottom of my heart, and on account of his dreams I hated him still more, and I desired to destroy him from off the land of the living. But Judah sold him by stealth to the Ishmaelites. Thus the God of our fathers saved him out of our hands, and He did not permit us to commit an abominable outrage in Israel. \"Hear now, my children, the words of truth, that ye may practice justice and the whole law of the Most High, and permit yourselves not to be tempted by the spirit of hatred. Evil is hatred, for it is the constant companion of deception, it always contradicts the truth. A little thing it magnifies into a great thing, light it takes for darkness, the sweet it calls bitter, and it teaches slander, enkindles anger, brings on war and violence, and fills the heart with devilish poison. I tell you my own experience, my children, that ye may drive hatred out of your hearts, and cleave to the love of the Lord. Righteousness banishes hatred, and humility kills it, for he that fears to give umbrage to the Lord, desires not to do wrong even in his thoughts. This is what I recognized at the last, after I had done penance on account of Joseph, for true atonement, pleasing to God, enlightens the eyes, illumines the soul with knowledge, and creates a counsel of salvation. My penance came in consequence of a sickness of the liver that God inflicted upon me. Without the prayers of my father Jacob, my spirit would have departed from me, for through the organ wherewith man transgresses, he is punished. As my liver had felt no mercy for Joseph, unmerciful suffering was caused unto me by my liver. My judgment lasted eleven months, as long as my enmity toward Joseph. \"And now, my children, each of you shall love his brother, and ye shall uproot hatred from your hearts by loving one another in word and deed and the thoughts of the soul. For I spake peaceably with Joseph in the presence of our father, but when I went out from before him, the spirit of hatred darkened my understanding, and stirred up my soul to murder him. If you see one that hath more good fortune than you, do not grieve, but pray for him, that his happiness may be perfect, and if one of the wicked even should grow rich in substance, like Esau, my father's brother, do not envy him. Wait for the end of the Lord. \"This also tell unto your children, that they shall honor Judah and Levi, for from them the Lord will cause a savior to arise unto Israel. For I know that in the end your children will fall off from God, and they will take part in all wickedness, malice, and corruptness, before the Lord.\" After Gad had rested a little while, he spake again, \"My children, hearken unto your father, and bury me with my fathers.\" Then he drew up his feet, and slept in peace. After five years, his sons carried his remains to Hebron unto his fathers.",

He spake: \"Hearken, ye sons of Asher, unto your father, and I will show you all that is right before God. Two ways hath God put before the children of men, and two inclinations hath He bestowed upon them, two kinds of actions and two aims. Therefore all things are in twos, the one opposite to the other. But ye, my children, ye shall not be double, pursuing both goodness and wickedness. Ye shall cling only to the ways of goodness, for the Lord taketh delight in them, and men yearn after them. And flee from wickedness, for thus you will destroy the evil inclination. Heed well the commands of the Lord, by following truth with a single mind. Observe the law of the Lord, and have not the same care for wicked things as for good things. Rather keep your eyes upon what is truly good, and guard it through all the commands of the Lord. The end of man, when he meets the messengers of God and of Satan, shows whether he was righteous or unrighteous in his life. If his soul goes out with agitation, she will be plagued by the evil spirit, whom she served with her lusts and her evil deeds; but if she departs tranquilly, the angel of peace will lead her to life eternal. \"Be not like Sodom, my children, which recognized not the angels of the Lord, that ye be not delivered into the hands of your enemies, and your land be cursed, and your sanctuary destroyed, and you be scattered to the four corners of the earth, and scorned in the confusion like stale water, until the Most High shall visit the earth, and break the heads of the dragons in the waters. Tell this, my sons, unto your children, that they be not disobedient toward God, for I read in the tablets of the heavens that you will be contumacious and act impiously toward Him, in that you will have no care for the law of God, but you will heed human laws, and they are corrupted by reason of man's godlessness. Therefore ye will be dispersed abroad like unto Gad and Dan, my brethren, and you will not know either your land, or your tribe, or your tongue. Nevertheless the Lord will gather you in His faithfulness, for the sake of His gracious mercy, and for the sake of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\" And when he had made an end of saying these words, he commanded them to bury him in Hebron.

When they appeared, he kissed them, and spake: \"As Isaac was born unto Abraham in his old age, so was I born unto Jacob when he was stricken in years. Therefore I was called Benjamin, 'the son of days.' My mother Rachel died at my birth, and Bilhah her slave suckled me. Rachel had no children for twelve years after bearing Joseph. Therefore she prayed to God, and fasted twelve days, and she conceived and bare me. Our father loved Rachel fondly, and he had longed greatly to have two sons by her. \"When I came down to Egypt, and my brother Joseph recognized me, he asked me, 'What said my brethren to my father regarding me?' And I told him that they had sent Jacob his coat stained with blood, and had said, 'Know now whether this be thy son's coat or not.' And Joseph said: 'This is what happened to me. Canaanitish merchantmen stole me away with violence, and on the way they wanted to hide my coat, to make it seem as though a wild beast had met me and slain me. But he who was about to conceal it, was torn by a lion, whereupon his companions, in great fear, sold me to the Ishmaelites. My brethren, thou seest, did not deceive my father with a lie.' In this wise Joseph tried to keep the deed of our brethren a secret from me. He also summoned my brethren, and enjoined them not to make known to our father what they had done to him, and bade them repeat the tale he had told me. \"Now, my children, love ye the Lord, the God of heaven and earth, and observe His commandments, taking that good and pious man Joseph as your model. Until the day of his death he would not have divulged what his brethren had done to him, and although God revealed their action to Jacob, he continued to deny it. Only after many efforts, when Jacob adjured him to confess the truth, he was induced to speak out. Even then he besought our father Jacob to pray for our brethren, that God account not the evil they had done to him as a sin. And Jacob exclaimed, 'O my good child Joseph, thou hast shown thyself more merciful than I was!' \"My children, have you observed the mercy of the good man? Imitate it with pure intention, that ye, too, may wear crowns of glory. A good man has not an envious eye, he has mercy with all, even with sinners, though their evil designs be directed against him, and by his good deeds he conquers the evil, since it was ordained of God. If you do good, the unclean spirits will depart from you, and even the wild beasts will stand in fear of you. The inclination of a good man lies not in the power of the tempter spirit Behar, for the angel of peace guides his soul. Flee before the malice of Beliar, whose sword is drawn to slay all that pay him obedience, and his sword is the mother of seven evils, bloodshed, corruptness, error, captivity, hunger, panic, and devastation. Therefore God surrendered Cain to seven punishments. Once in a hundred years the Lord brought a castigation upon him. His afflictions began when he was two hundred years old, and in his nine hundredth year he was destroyed by the deluge, for having slain his righteous brother Abel. And those who are like unto Cain will be chastised forever with the same punishments as his. \"Know now, my children, that I am about to die. Practice truth and righteousness, and observe the law of the Lord and also His commandments. This I bequeath unto you as your sole heritage, and you shall leave it to your children as an eternal possession. Thus Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did, they transmitted it unto us, saying, 'Observe the commands of God, until the Lord shall reveal His salvation in the sight of all the heathen.' Then you will see Enoch, Noah, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob rise up with rejoicing to new life at the right hand of God, and we brethren, the sons of Jacob, will arise also, each of us at the head of his tribe, and we will pay homage to the King of the heavens.\" After Benjamin had made an end of speaking thus, he said: \"I command you, my children, to carry my bones up out of Egypt and bury me near my fathers.\" And when he had made an end of saying these things, he fell asleep at a good old age, and they put his body into a coffin, and in the ninety-first year of their sojourning in Egypt, his sons and the sons of his brethren brought up the bones of their father, in secret, and buried them in Hebron, at the feet of their fathers. Then they returned from the land of Canaan, and they dwelt in Egypt until the day of the exodus from the land.",

      "title": "Job And The Patriarchs",
      "content": "Job, the most pious Gentile that ever lived, one of the few to bear the title of honor \"the servant of God,\" was of double kin to Jacob. He was a grandson of Jacob's brother Esau, and at the same time the son-in-law of Jacob himself, for lie had married Dinah as his second wife. He was entirely worthy of being a member of the Patriarch's family, for he was perfectly upright, one that feared God, and eschewed evil. Had he not wavered in his resignation to the Divine will during the great trial to which he was subjected, and murmured against God, the distinction would have been conferred upon him of having his name joined to the Name of God in prayer, and men would have called upon the God of Job as they now call upon the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But he was not found steadfast like the three Fathers, and he forfeited the honor God had intended for him. The Lord remonstrated with him for his lack of patience, saying: \"Why didst thou murmur when suffering came upon thee? Dost thou think thyself of greater worth than Adam, the creation of Mine own hands, upon whom together with his descendants I decreed death on account of a single transgression? And yet Adam murmured not. Thou art surely not more worthy than Abraham, whom I tempted with many trials, and when he asked, 'Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit the land?' and I replied, 'Know of a surety that thy seed will be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years,' he yet murmured not. Thou dost not esteem thyself more worthy than Moses, dost thou? Him I would not grant the favor of entering the promised land, because he spake the words, 'Hear now, ye rebels; shall we bring you forth water out of this rock?' And yet he murmured not. Art thou more worthy than Aaron, unto whom I showed greater honor than unto any created being, for I sent the angels themselves out of the Holy of Holies when he entered the place? Yet when his two sons died, he murmured not.\" The contrast between Job and the Patriarchs appears from words spoken by him and words spoken by Abraham. Addressing God, Abraham said, \"That be far from Thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked,\" and Job exclaimed against God, \"It is all one; therefore I say, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.\" They both received their due recompense, Abraham was rewarded and Job was punished. Convinced that his suffering was undeserved and unjust, Job had the audacity to say to God: \"O Lord of the world, Thou didst create the ox with cloven feet and the ass with unparted hoof, Thou hast created Paradise and hell, Thou createst the righteous and also the wicked. There is none to hinder, Thou canst do as seemeth good in Thy sight.\" The friends of Job replied: \"It is true, God hath created the evil inclination, but He hath also given man the Torah as a remedy against it. Therefore the wicked cannot roll their guilt from off their shoulders and put it upon God.\" The reason Job did not shrink from such extravagant utterances was because he denied the resurrection of the dead. He judged of the prosperity of the wicked and the woes of the pious only by their earthly fortunes. Proceeding from this false premise, he held it to be possible that the punishment falling to his share was not at all intended for him. God had slipped into an error, He imposed the suffering upon him that had been appointed unto a sinner. But God spake to him, saying: \"Many hairs have I created upon the head of man, yet each hair hath its own sac, for were two hairs to draw their nourishment from the same sac, man would lose the sight of his eyes. It hath never happened that a sac hath been misplaced. Should I, then, have mistaken Job for another? I let many drops of rain descend from the heavens, and for each drop there is a mould in the clouds, for were two drops to issue from the same mould, the ground would be made so miry that it could not bring forth any growth. It hath never happened that a mould hath been misplaced. Should I, then, have mistaken Job for another? Many thunderbolts I hurl from the skies, but each one comes from its own path, for were two to proceed from the same path, they would destroy the whole world. It hath never happened that a path hath been misplaced. Should I, then, have mistaken Job for another? The gazelle gives birth to her young on the topmost point of a rock, and it would fall into the abyss and be crushed to death, if I did not send an eagle thither to catch it up and carry it to its mother. Were the eagle to appear a minute earlier or later than the appointed time, the little gazelle would perish. It hath never happened that the proper minute of time was missed. Should I, then, have mistaken Job for another? The hind has a contracted womb, and would not be able to bring forth her young, if I did not send a dragon to her at the right second, to nibble at her womb and soften it, for then she can bear. Were the dragon to come a second before or after the right time, the hind would perish. It hath never happened that I missed the right second. Should I, then, have mistaken Job for another?\" Notwithstanding Job's unpardonable words, God was displeased with his friends for passing harsh judgment upon him. \"A man may not be held responsible for what he does in his anguish,\" and Job's agony was great, indeed",

      "title": "Job's Wealth And Benefactions",
      "content": "Job was asked once what he considered the severest affliction that could strike him, and he replied, \"My enemies' joy in my misfortune, and when God demanded to know of him, after the accusations made by Satan, what he preferred, poverty or physical suffering, he chose pain, saying, \"O Lord of the whole world, chastise my body with suffering of all kinds, only preserve me from poverty.\" Poverty seemed the greater scourge, because before his trials he had occupied a brilliant position on account of his vast wealth. God graciously granted him this foretaste of the Messianic time. The harvest followed close upon the ploughing of his field; no sooner were the seeds strewn in the furrows, than they sprouted and grew and ripened produce. He was equally successful with his cattle. His sheep killed wolves, but were themselves never harmed by wild beasts. Of sheep he had no less than one hundred and thirty thousand, and he required eight hundred dogs to keep guard over them, not to mention the two hundred dogs needed to secure the safety of his house. Besides, his herds consisted of three hundred and forty thousand asses and thirty-five hundred pairs of oxen. All these possessions were not used for selfindulgent pleasures, but for the good of the poor and the needy, whom he clothed, and fed, and provided with all things necessary. To do all this, he even had to employ ships that carried supplies to all the cities and the dwellingplaces of the destitute. His house was furnished with doors on all its four sides, that the poor and the wayfarer might enter, no matter from what direction they approached. At all times there were thirty tables laden with viands ready in his house, and twelve besides for widows only, so that all who came found what they desired. Job's consideration for the poor was so delicate that he kept servants to wait upon them constantly. His guests, enraptured by his charitableness, frequently offered themselves as attendants to minister to the poor in his house, but Job always insisted upon paying them for their services. If he was asked for a loan of money, to be used for business purposes, and the borrower promised to give a part of his profits to the poor, he would demand no security beyond a mere signature. And if it happened that by some mischance or other the debtor was not able to discharge his obligation, Job would return the note to him, or tear it into bits in his presence. He did not rest satisfied at supplying the material needs of those who applied to him. He strove also to convey the knowledge of God to them. After a meal he was in the habit of having music played upon instruments, and then he would invite those present to join him in songs of praise to God. On such occasions he did not consider himself above playing the cithern while the musicians rested. Most particularly Job concerned himself about the weal and woe of widows and orphans. He was wont to pay visits to the sick, both rich and poor, and when it was necessary, he would bring a physician along with him. If the case turned out to be hopeless, he would sustain the stricken family with advice and consolation. When the wife of the incurably sick man began to grieve and weep, he would encourage her with such words as these: \"Trust always in the grace and lovingkindness of God. He hath not abandoned thee until now, and He will not forsake thee henceforth. Thy husband will be restored to health, and will be able to provide for his family as heretofore. But if—which may God forefend—thy husband should die, I call Heaven to witness that I shall provide sustenance for thee and thy children.\" Having spoken thus, he would send for a notary, and have him draw up a document, which he signed in the presence of witnesses, binding himself to care for the family, should it be bereaved of its head. Thus he earned for himself the blessing of the sick man and the gratitude of the sorrowing wife. Sometimes, in case of necessity, Job could be severe, too, especially when it was a question of helping a poor man obtain his due. If one of the parties to a suit cited before his tribunal was known to be a man of violence, he would surround himself with his army and inspire him with fear, so that the culprit could not but show himself amenable to his decision. He endeavored to inculcate his benevolent ways upon his children, by accustoming them to wait upon the poor. On the morrow after a feast he would sacrifice bountifully to God, and together with the pieces upon the altar his offerings would be divided among the needy. He would say: \"Take and help yourselves, and pray for my children. It may be that they have sinned, and renounced God, saying in the presumption of their hearts: 'We are the children of this rich man. All these things are our possessions. Why should we be servants to the poor?' \"",

      "content": "The happy, God-pleasing life led by Job for many years excited the hatred of Satan, who had an old grudge against him. Near Job's house there was an idol worshipped by the people. Suddenly doubts assailed the heart of Job, and he asked himself: \"Is this idol really the creator of heaven and earth? How can I find out the truth about it?\" In the following night he perceived a voice calling: \"Jobab! Jobab! Arise, and I will tell thee who he is whom thou desirest to know. This one to whom the people offer sacrifices is not God, he is the handiwork of the tempter, wherewith he deceives men.\" When he heard the voice, Job threw himself on the ground, and said: \"O Lord, if this idol is the handiwork of the tempter, then grant that I may destroy it. None can hinder me, for I am the king of this land.\" Job, or, as he is sometimes called, Jobab, was, indeed, king of Edom, the land wherein wicked plans are concocted against God, wherefore it is called also Uz, \"counsel.\" The voice continued to speak. It made itself known as that of an archangel of God, and revealed to Job that he would bring down the enmity of Satan upon himself by the destruction of the idol, and much suffering with it. However, if he remained steadfast under them, God would change his troubles into joys, his name would become celebrated throughout the generations of mankind, and he would have a share in the resurrection to eternal life. Job replied to the voice: \"Out of love of God I am ready to endure all things unto the day of my death. I will shrink back from naught.\" Now Job arose, and accompanied by fifty men he repaired to the idol, and destroyed it. Knowing that Satan would try to approach him, he ordered his guard not to give access to any one, and then he withdrew to his chamber. He had guessed aright. Satan appeared at once, in the guise of a beggar, and demanded speech with Job. The guard executed his orders, and forbade his entering. Then the mendicant asked him to intercede for him with Job for a piece of bread. Job knew it was Satan, and he sent word to him as follows, \"Do not expect to eat of my bread, for it is prohibited unto thee,\" at the same time putting a piece of burnt bread into the hand of the guard for Satan. The servant was ashamed to give a beggar burnt bread, and he substituted a good piece for it. Satan, however, knowing that the servant had not executed his master's errand, told him so to his face, and he fetched the burnt bread and handed it to him, repeating the words of Job. Thereupon Satan returned this answer, \"As the bread is burnt, so I will disfigure thy body.\" Job replied: \"Do as thou desirest, and execute thy plan. As for me, I am ready to suffer whatever thou bringest down upon me.\" Now Satan betook himself to God, and prayed Him to put Job into his power, saying: \"I went to and fro in the earth, and walked up and down in it, and I saw no man as pious as Abraham. Thou didst promise him the whole land of Palestine, and yet he did not take it in ill part that he had not so much as a burial-place for Sarah. As for Job, it is true, I found none that loveth Thee as he does, but if Thou wilt put him into my hand, I shall succeed in turning his heart away from Thee.\" But God spake, \"Satan, Satan, what hast thou a mind to do with my servant Job, like whom there is none in the earth?\" Satan persisted in his request touching Job, and God granted it, He gave him full power over Job's possessions. This day of Job's accusation was the New Year's Day, whereon the good and the evil deeds of man are brought before God.",

      "content": "Equipped with unlimited power, Satan endeavored to deprive Job of all he owned. He burnt part of his cattle, and the other part was carried off by enemies. What pained Job more than this was that recipients of his bounty turned against him, and took of his belongings. Among the adversaries that assailed him was Lilith, the queen of Sheba. She lived at a great distance from his residence, it took her and her army three years to travel from her home to his. She fell upon his oxen and his asses, and took possession of them, after slaying the men to whose care Job had entrusted them. One man escaped alone. Wounded and bruised, he had only enough life in him to tell Job the tale of his losses, and then he fell down dead. The sheep, which had been left unmolested by the queen of Sheba, were taken away by the Chaldeans. Job's first intention was to go to war against these marauders, but when he was told that some of his property had been consumed by fire from heaven, he desisted, and said, \"If the heavens turn against me, I can do nothing.\" Dissatisfied with the result, Satan disguised himself as the king of Persia, besieged the city of Job's residence, took it, and spoke to the inhabitants, saying: \"This man Job hath appropriated all the goods in the world, leaving naught for others, and he hath also torn down the temple of our god, and now I will pay him back for his wicked deeds. Come with me and let us pillage his house.\" At first the people refused to hearken to the words of Satan. They feared that the sons and daughters of Job might rise up against them later, and avenge their father's wrongs. But after Satan had pulled down the house wherein the children of Job were assembled, and they lay dead in the ruins, the people did as he bade them, and sacked the house of Job. Seeing that neither the loss of all he had nor the death of his children could change his pious heart, Satan appeared before God a second time, and requested that Job himself, his very person, be put into his hand. God granted Satan's plea, but he limited his power to Job's body, his soul he could not touch. In a sense Satan was worse off than Job. He was in the position of the slave that has been ordered by his master to break the pitcher and not spill the wine. Satan now caused a terrific storm to burst over the house of Job. He was cast from his throne by the reverberations, and he lay upon the floor for three hours. Then Satan smote his body with leprosy from the sole of his foot unto his crown. This plague forced Job to leave the city, and sit down outside upon an ash-heap, for his lower limbs were covered with oozing boils, and the issue flowed out upon the ashes. The upper part of his body was encrusted with dry boils, and to ease the itching they caused him, he used his nails, until they dropped off together with his fingertips, and he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal. His body swarmed with vermin, but if one of the little creatures attempted to crawl away from him, he forced it back, saying, \"Remain on the place whither thou wast sent, until God assigns another unto thee.\" His wife, fearful that he would not bear his horrible suffering with steadfastness, advised him to pray to God for death, that lie might be sure of going hence an upright man. But he rejected her counsel, saying, \"If in the days of good fortune, which usually tempts men to deny God, I stood firm, and did not rebel against Him, surely I shall be able to remain steadfast under misfortune, which compels men to be obedient to God.\" And Job stuck to his resolve in spite of all suffering, while his wife was not strong enough to bear her fate with resignation to the will of God. Her lot was bitter, indeed, for she had had to take service as a water-carrier with a common churl, and when her master learnt that she shared her bread with Job, he dismissed her. To keep her husband from starving, she cut off her hair, and purchased bread with it. It was all she had to pay the price charged by the bread merchant, none other than Satan himself, who wanted to put her to the test. He said to her, \"Hadst thou not deserved this great misery of thine, it had not come upon thee.\" This speech was more than the poor woman could bear. Then it was that she came to her husband, and amid tears and groans urged him to renounce God and die. Job, however, was not perturbed by her words, because he divined at once that Satan stood behind his wife, and seduced her to speak thus. Turning to the tempter, he said: \"Why dost thou not meet me frankly? Give up thy underhand ways, thou wretch.\" Thereupon Satan appeared before Job, admitted that he had been vanquished, and went away abashed.",

      "content": "The friends of Job lived in different places, at intervals of three hundred miles one from the other. Nevertheless they all were informed of their friend's misfortune at the same time, in this way: Each one had the pictures of the others set in his crown, and as soon as any one of them met with reverses, it showed itself in his picture. Thus the friends of Job learnt simultaneously of his misfortune, and they hastened to his assistance. The four friends were related to one another, and each one was related to Job. Eliphaz, king of Teman, was a son of Esau; Bildad, Zophar, and Elihu were cousins, their fathers, Shuah, Naamat, and Barachel, were the sons of Buz, who was a brother of Job and a nephew of Abraham. When the four friends arrived in the city in which Job lived, the inhabitants took them outside the gates, and pointing to a figure reclining upon an ash-heap at some distance off, they said, \"Yonder is Job.\" At first the friends would not give them credence, and they decided to look more closely at the man, to make sure of his identity. But the foul smell emanating from Job was so strong that they could not come near to him. They ordered their armies to scatter perfumes and aromatic substances all around. Only after this had been done for hours, they could approach the outcast close enough to recognize him. Eliphaz was the first to address Job, \"Art thou indeed Job, a king equal in rank with ourselves?\" And when Job said Aye, they broke out into lamentations and bitter tears, and all together they sang an elegy, the armies of the three kings, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, joining in the choir. Again Eliphaz began to speak, and he bemoaned Job's sad fortune, and depicted his friend's former glory, adding the refrain to each sentence, \"Whither hath departed the splendor of thy throne?\" After listening long to the wailing and lamenting of Eliphaz and his companions, Job spake, saying: \"Silence, and I will show you my throne and the splendor of its glory. Kings will perish, rulers disappear, their pride and lustre will pass like a shadow across a mirror, but my kingdom will persist forever and ever, for glory and magnificence are in the chariot of my Father.\" These words aroused the wrath of Eliphaz, and he called upon his associates to abandon Job to his fate and go their way. But Bildad appeased his anger, reminding him that some allowance ought to be made for one so sorely tried as Job. Bildad put a number of questions to the sufferer in order to establish his sanity. He wanted to elicit from Job how it came about that God, upon whom he continued to set his hopes, could inflict such dire suffering. Not even a king of flesh and blood would allow a guardsman of his that had served him loyally to come to grief. Bildad desired to have information from Job also concerning the movements of the heavenly bodies. Job had but one answer to make to these questions: man cannot comprehend Divine wisdom, whether it reveal itself in inanimate and brute nature or in relation to human beings. \"But,\" continued Job, \"to prove to you that I am in my right mind, listen to the question I shall put to you. Solid food and liquids combine inside of man, and they separate again when they leave his body. Who effects the separation?\" And when Bildad conceded that he could not answer the question, Job said, \"If thou canst not comprehend the changes in thy body, how canst thou hope to comprehend the movements of the planets?\" Zophar, after Job had spoken thus to Bildad, was convinced that his suffering had had no effect upon his mind, and he asked him whether he would permit himself to be treated by the physicians of the three kings, his friends. But Job rejected the offer, saying, \"My healing and my restoration come from God, the Creator of all physicians.\" While the three kings were conversing thus with Job, his wife Zitidos made her appearance clad in rags, and she threw herself at the feet of her husband's friends, and amid tears she spoke, saying: \"O Eliphaz, and ye other friends of Job, remember what I was in other days, and how I am now changed, coming before you in rags and tatters.\" The sight of the unhappy woman touched them so deeply that they could only weep, and not a word could they force out of their mouths. Eliphaz, however, took his royal mantle of purple, and laid it about the shoulders of the poor woman. Zitidos asked only one favor, that the three kings should order their soldiers to clear away the ruins of the building under which her children lay entombed, that she might give their remains decent burial. The command was issued to the soldiers accordingly, but Job said, \"Do not put yourselves to trouble for naught. My children will not be found, for they are safely bestowed with their Lord and Creator.\" Again his friends were sure that Job was bereft of his senses. He arose, however, prayed to God, and at the end of his devotions, he bade his friends look eastward, and when they did his bidding, they beheld his children next to the Ruler of heaven, with crowns of glory upon their heads. Zitidos prostrated herself, and said, \"Now I know that my memorial resides with the Lord.\" And she returned to the house of her master, whence she had absented herself for some time against his will. He had forbidden her to leave it, because he had feared that the three kings would take her with them. In the evening she lay down to sleep next to the manger for the cattle, but she never rose again, she died there of exhaustion. The people of the city made a great mourning for her, and the elegy composed in her honor was set down in writing and recorded.",

Especially Elihu was animated by Satan to speak scurrilous words against Job, upbraiding him for his unshakable confidence in God. Then the Lord appeared to them, first unto Job, and revealed to him that Elihu was in the wrong, and his words were inspired by Satan. Next he appeared unto Eliphaz, and to him He spake thus: \"Thou and thy friends Bildad and Zophar have committed a sin, for ye did not speak the truth concerning my servant Job. Rise up and let him bring a sin offering for you. Only for his sake do I refrain from destroying you.\" The sacrifice offered by Job in behalf of his friends was accepted graciously by God, and Eliphaz broke out into a hymn of thanksgiving to the Lord for having pardoned the transgression of himself and his two friends. At the same time he announced the damnation of Elihu, the instrument of Satan. God appeared to Job once more, and gave him a girdle composed of three ribands, and he bade him tie it around his waist. Hardly had he put it on when all his pain disappeared, his very recollection of it vanished, and, more than this, God made him to see all that ever was and all that shall ever be. After suffering sevenfold pain for seven years Job was restored to strength. With his three friends he returned to the city, and the inhabitants made a festival in his honor and unto the glory of God. All his former friends joined him again, and he resumed his old occupation, the care of the poor, for which he obtained the means from the people around. He said to them, \"Give me, each one of you, a sheep for the clothing of the poor, and four silver or gold drachmas for their other needs.\" The Lord blessed Job, and in a few days his wealth had increased to double the substance he had owned before misfortune overtook him. Zitidos having died during the years of his trials, he married a second wife, Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and she bore him seven sons and three daughters. He had never had more than one wife at a time, for he was wont to say, \"If it had been intended that Adam should have ten wives, God would have given them to him. Only one wife was bestowed upon him, whereby God indicated that he was to have but one, and therefore one wife suffices for me, too.\" When Job, after a long and happy life, felt his end approaching, he gathered his ten children around him, and told them the tale of his days. Having finished the narrative, he admonished them in these words: \"See, I am about to die, and you will stand in my place. Forsake not the Lord, be generous toward the poor, treat the feeble with consideration, and do not marry with the women of the Gentiles.\" Thereupon he divided his possessions among his sons, and to his daughters he gave what is more precious than all earthly goods, to each of them one riband of the celestial girdle he had received from God. The magic virtue of these ribands was such that no sooner did their possessors tie them around their waists than they were transformed into higher beings, and with seraphic voices they broke out into hymns after the manner of the angels. For three days Job lay upon his bed, sick though not suffering, for the celestial girdle made him proof against pain. On the fourth day he saw the angels descend to fetch his soul. He arose from his bed, handed a cithern to his oldest daughter Jemimah, \"Day,\" a censer to the second one, Keziah, \"Perfume,\" and a cymbal to the third, Amaltheas, \"Horn,\" and bade them welcome the angels with the sound of music. They played and sang and praised the Lord in the holy tongue. Then he appeared that sits in the great chariot, kissed Job, and rode away bearing his soul with him eastward. None saw them depart except the three daughters of Job. The grief of the people, especially the poor, the widows, and the orphans, was exceeding great. For three days they left the corpse unburied, because they could not entertain the thought of separating themselves from it. As the name of Job will remain imperishable unto all time, by reason of the man's piety, so his three friends were recompensed by God for their sympathy with him in his distress. Their names were preserved, the punishment of hell was remitted unto them, and, best of all, God poured out the holy spirit over them. But Satan, the cause of Job's anguish, the Lord cast down from heaven, for he had been vanquished by Job, who amid his agony had thanked and praised God for all He had done unto him.",

      "content": "As soon as Jacob was dead, the eyes of the Israelites were closed, as well as their hearts. They began to feel the dominion of the stranger, although real bondage did not enslave them until some time later. While a single one of the sons of Jacob was alive, the Egyptians did not venture to approach the Israelites with evil intent. It was only when Levi, the last of them, had departed this life that their suffering commenced. A change in the relation of the Egyptians toward the Israelites had, indeed, been noticeable immediately after the death of Joseph, but they did not throw off their mask completely until Levi was no more. Then the slavery of the Israelites supervened in good earnest. The first hostile act on the part of the Egyptians was to deprive the Israelites of their fields, their vineyards, and the gifts that Joseph had sent to his brethren. Not content with these animosities, they sought to do them harm in, other ways. The reason for the hatred of the Egyptians was envy and fear. The Israelites had increased to a miraculous degree. At the death of Jacob the seventy persons he had brought down with him bad grown to the number of six hundred thousand, and their physical strength and heroism were extraordinary and therefore alarming to the Egyptians. There were many occasions at that time for the display of prowess. Not long after the death of Levi occurred that of the Egyptian king Magron, who had been bred up by Joseph, and therefore was not wholly without grateful recollection of what he and his family had accomplished for the welfare of Egypt. But his son and successor Malol, together with his whole court, knew not the sons of Jacob and their achievements, and they did not scruple to oppress the Hebrews. The final breach between them and the Egyptians took place during the wars waged by Malol against Zepho, the grandson of Esau. In the course of it, the Israelites had saved the Egyptians from a crushing defeat, but instead of being grateful they sought only the undoing of their benefactors, from fear that the giant strength of the Hebrews might be turned against them.",

      "content": "The counsellors and elders of Egypt came to Pharaoh, and spake unto him, saying: \"Behold, the people of the children of Israel are greater and mightier than we. Thou hast seen their strong power, which they have inherited from their fathers, for a few of them stood up against a people as many as the sand of the sea, and not one hath fallen. Now, therefore, give us counsel what to do with them, until we shall gradually destroy them from among us, lest they become too numerous in the land, for if they multiply, and there falleth out any war, they will also join themselves with their great strength unto our enemies, and fight against us, destroy us from the land, and get them up out of the land.\" The king answered the elders, saying: \"This is the plan advised by me against Israel, from which we will not depart. Behold, Pithom and Raamses are cities not fortified against battle. It behooves us to fortify them. Now, go ye and act cunningly against the children of Israel, and proclaim in Egypt and in Goshen, saying: 'All ye men of Egypt, Goshen, and Pathros! The king has commanded us to build Pithom and Raamses and fortify them against battle. Those amongst you in all Egypt, of the children of Israel and of all the inhabitants of the cities, who are willing to build with us, shall have their wages given to them daily at the king's order.' \"Then go ye first, and begin to build Pithom and Raamses, and cause the king's proclamation to be made daily, and when some of the children of Israel come to build, do ye give them their wages daily, and after they shall have built with you for their daily wages, draw yourselves away from them day by day, and one by one, in secret. Then you shall rise up and become their taskmasters and their officers, and you shall have them afterward to build without wages. And should they refuse, then force them with all your might to build. If you do this, it will go well with us, for we shall cause our land to be fortified after this manner, and with the children of Israel it will go ill, for they will decrease in number on account of the work, because you will prevent them from being with their wives.\" The elders, the counsellors, and the whole of Egypt did according to the word of the king. For a month the servants of Pharaoh built with Israel, then they withdrew themselves gradually, while the children of Israel continued to work, receiving their daily wages, for some men of Egypt were still carrying on the work with them. After a time all the Egyptians had withdrawn, and they had turned to become the officers and taskmasters of the Israelites. Then they refrained from giving them any pay, and when some of the Hebrews refused to work without wages, their taskmasters smote them, and made them return by force to labor with their brethren. And the children of Israel were greatly afraid of the Egyptians, and they came again and worked without pay, all except the tribe of Levi, who were not employed in the work with their brethren. The children of Levi knew that the proclamation of the king was made to deceive Israel, therefore they refrained from listening to it, and the Egyptians did not molest them later, since they had not been with their brethren at the beginning, and though the Egyptians embittered the lives of the other Israelites with servile labor, they did not disturb the children of Levi. The Israelites called Malol, the king of Egypt, Maror, \"Bitterness,\" because in his days the Egyptians embittered their lives with all manner of rigorous service. But Pharaoh did not rest satisfied with his proclamation and the affliction it imposed upon the Israelites. He suspended a brick-press from his own neck, and himself took part in the work at Pithom and Raamses. After this, whenever a Hebrew refused to come and help with the building, alleging that he was not fit for such hard service, the Egyptians would retort, saying, \"Dost thou mean to make us believe thou art more delicate than Pharaoh?\" The king himself urged the Israelites on with gentle words, saying, \"My children, I beg you to do this work and erect these little buildings for me. I will give you great reward therefor.\" By means of such artifices and wily words the Egyptians succeeded in overmastering the Israelites, and once they had them in their power, they treated them with undisguised brutality. Women were forced to perform men's work, and men women's work. The building of Pithom and Raamses turned out of no advantage to the Egyptians, for scarcely were the structures completed, when they collapsed, or they were swallowed by the earth, and the Hebrew workmen, besides having to suffer hardships during their erection, lost their lives by being precipitated from enormous heights, when the buildings fell in a heap. But the Egyptians were little concerned whether or not they derived profit from the forced labor of the children of Israel. Their main object was to hinder their increase, and Pharaoh therefore issued an order, that they were not to be permitted to sleep at their own homes, that so they might be deprived of the opportunity of having intercourse with their wives. The officers executed the will of the king, telling the Hebrews that the reason was the loss of too much time in going to and fro, which would prevent them from completing the required tale of bricks. Thus the Hebrew husbands were kept apart from their wives, and they were compelled to sleep on the ground, away from their habitations. But God spake, saying: \"Unto their father Abraham I gave the promise, that I would make his children to be as numerous as the stars in the heavens, and you contrive plans to prevent them from multiplying. We shall see whose word will stand, Mine or yours.\" And it came to pass that the more the Egyptians afflicted them, the more they multiplied, and the more they spread abroad. And they continued to increase in spite of Pharaoh's command, that those who did not complete the required tale of bricks were to be immured in the buildings between the layers of bricks, and great was the number of the Israelites that lost their lives in this way. Many of their children were, besides, slaughtered as sacrifices to the idols of the Egyptians. For this reason God visited retribution upon the idols at the time of the going forth of the Israelites from Egypt. They had caused the death of the Hebrew children, and in turn they were shattered, and they crumbled into dust.\"",

      "title": "The Pious Midwives",
      "content": "When now, in spite of all their tribulations, the children of Israel continued to multiply and spread abroad, so that the land was full of them as with thick underbrush—for the women brought forth many children at a birth—the Egyptians appeared before Pharaoh again, and urged him to devise some other way of ridding the land of the Hebrews, seeing that they were increasing mightily, though they were made to toil and labor hard. Pharaoh could invent no new design; he asked his counsellors to give him their opinion of the thing. Then spake one of them, Job of the land of Uz, which is in Aram-naharaim, as follows: \"The plan which the king invented, of putting a great burden of work upon the Israelites, was good in its time, and it should be executed henceforth, too, but to secure us against the fear that, if a war should come to pass, they may overwhelm us by reason of their numbers, and chase us forth out of the land, let the king issue a decree, that every male child of the Israelites shall be killed at his birth. Then we need not be afraid of them if we should be overtaken by war. Now let the king summon the Hebrew midwives, that they come hither, and let him command them in accordance with this plan.\" Job's advice found favor in the eyes of Pharaoh and the Egyptians.\" They preferred to have the midwives murder the innocents, for they feared the punishment of God if they laid hands upon them themselves. Pharaoh cited the two midwives of the Hebrews before him, and commanded them to slay all men children, but to save the daughters of the Hebrew women alive,\" for the Egyptians were as much interested in preserving the female children as in bringing about the death of the male children. They were very sensual, and were desirous of having as many women as possible at their service.\" However, the plan, even if it had been carried into execution, was not wise, for though a man may marry many wives, each woman can marry but one husband. Thus a diminished number of men and a corresponding increase in the number of women did not constitute so serious a menace to the continuance of the nation of the Israelites as the reverse case would have been. The two Hebrew midwives were Jochebed, the mother of Moses, and Miriam, his sister. When they appeared before Pharaoh, Miriam exclaimed: \"Woe be to this man when God visits retribution upon him for his evil deeds.\" The king would have killed her for these audacious words, had not Jochebed allayed his wrath by saying: \"Why dost thou pay heed to her words? She is but a child, and knows not what she speaks.\" Yet, although Miriam was but five years old at the time, she nevertheless accompanied her mother, and helped her with her offices to the Hebrew women, giving food to the new-born babes while Jochebed washed and bathed them. Pharaoh's order ran as follows: \"At the birth of the child, if it be a man child, kill it; but if it be a female child, then you need not kill it, but you may save it alive.\" The midwives returned: \"How are we to know whether the child is male or female?\" for the king had bidden them kill it while it was being born. Pharaoh replied: \"If the child issues forth from the womb with its face foremost, it is a man child, for it looks to the earth, whence man was taken; but if its feet appear first, it is a female, for it looks up toward the rib of the mother, and from a rib woman was made.\" The king used all sorts of devices to render the midwives amenable to his wishes. He approached them with amorous proposals, which they both repelled, and then he threatened them with death by fire. But they said within themselves: \"Our father Abraham opened an inn, that he might feed the wayfarers, though they were heathen, and we should neglect the children, nay, kill them? No, we shall have a care to keep them alive.\" Thus they failed to execute what Pharaoh had commanded. Instead of murdering the babes, they supplied all their needs. If a mother that had given birth to a child lacked food and drink, the midwives went to well-to-do women, and took up a collection, that the infant might not suffer want. They did still more for the little ones. They made supplication to God, praying: \"Thou knowest that we are not fulfilling the words of Pharaoh, but it is our aim to fulfil Thy words. O that it be Thy will, our Lord, to let the child come into the world safe and sound, lest we fall under the suspicion that we tried to slay it, and maimed it in the attempt.\" The Lord hearkened to their prayer, and no child born under the ministrations of Shiphrah and Puah, or Jochebed and Miriam, as the midwives are also called, came into the world lame or blind or afflicted with any other blemish. Seeing that his command was ineffectual, he summoned the midwives a second time, and called them to account for their disobedience. They replied: \"This nation is compared unto one animal and another, and, in sooth, the Hebrews are like the animals. As little as the animals do they need the offices of midwives.\" These two God-fearing women were rewarded in many ways for their good deeds. Not only that Pharaoh did them no harm, but they were made the ancestors of priests and Levites, and kings and princes. Jochebed became the mother of the priest Aaron and of the Levite Moses, and from Miriam's union with Caleb sprang the royal house of David. The hand of God was visible in her married life. She contracted a grievous sickness, and though it was thought by all that saw her that death would certainly overtake her, she recovered, and God restored her youth, and bestowed unusual beauty upon her, so that renewed happiness awaited her husband, who had been deprived of the pleasures of conjugal life during her long illness. His unexpected joys were the reward of his piety and trust in God. And another recompense was accorded to Miriam: she was privileged to bring forth Bezalel, the builder of the Tabernacle, who was endowed with celestial wisdom.",

      "content": "In the one hundred and thirtieth year after Israel's going down to Egypt Pharaoh dreamed that he was sitting upon his throne, and he lifted up his eyes, and he beheld an old man before him with a balance in his hand, and he saw him taking all the elders, nobles, and great men of Egypt, tying them together, and laying them in one scale of the balance, while he put a tender kid into the other. The kid bore down the pan in which it lay until it hung lower than the other with the bound Egyptians. Pharaoh arose early in the morning, and called together all his servants and his wise men to interpret his dream, and the men were greatly afraid on account of his vision. Balaam the son of Beor then spake, and said: \"This means nothing but that a great evil will spring up against Egypt, for a son will be born unto Israel, who will destroy the whole of our land and all its inhabitants, and he will bring forth the Israelites from Egypt with a mighty hand. Now, therefore, O king, take counsel as to this matter, that the hope of Israel be frustrated before this evil arise against Egypt.\" The king said unto Balaam: \"What shall we do unto Israel? We have tried several devices against this people, but we could not prevail over it. Now let me hear thy opinion.\" At Balaam's instance, the king sent for his two counsellors, Reuel the Midianite and Job the Uzite, to hear their advice. Reuel spoke: \"If it seemeth good to the king, let him desist from the Hebrews, and let him not stretch forth his hand against them, for the Lord chose them in days of old, and took them as the lot of His inheritance from amongst all the nations of the earth, and who is there that hath dared stretch forth his hand against them with impunity, but that their God avenged the evil done unto them?\" Reuel then proceeded to enumerate some of the mighty things God had performed for Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and he closed his admonition with the words: \"Verily, thy grandfather, the Pharaoh of former days, raised Joseph the son of Jacob above all the princes of Egypt, because he discerned his wisdom, for through his wisdom he rescued all the inhabitants of the land from the famine, after which he invited Jacob and his sons to come down to Egypt, that the land of Egypt and the land of Goshen be delivered from the famine through their virtues. Now, therefore, if it seem good in thine eyes, leave off from destroying the children of Israel, and if it be not thy will that they dwell in Egypt, send them forth from here, that they may go to the land of Canaan, the land wherein their ancestors sojourned.\" When Pharaoh heard the words of Jethro-Reuel, he was exceedingly wroth with him, and he was dismissed in disgrace from before the king, and he went to Midian. The king then spoke to Job, and said: \"What sayest thou, Job, and what is thy advice respecting the Hebrews?\" Job replied: \"Behold, all the inhabitants of the land are in thy power. Let the king do as seemeth good in his eyes.\" Balaam was the last to speak at the behest of the king, and he said: \"From all that the king may devise against the Hebrews, they will be delivered. If thou thinkest to diminish them by the flaming fire, thou wilt not prevail over them, for their God delivered Abraham their father from the furnace in which the Chaldeans cast him. Perhaps thou thinkest to destroy them with a sword, but their father Isaac was delivered from being slaughtered by the sword. And if thou thinkest to reduce them through hard and rigorous labor, thou wilt also not prevail, for their father Jacob served Laban in all manner of hard work, and yet he prospered. If it please the king, let him order all the male children that shall be born in Israel from this day forward to be thrown into the water. Thereby canst thou wipe out their name, for neither any of them nor any of their fathers was tried in this way.",

      "content": "Balaam's advice was accepted by Pharaoh and the Egyptians. They knew that God pays measure for measure, therefore they believed that the drowning of the men children would be the safest means of exterminating the Hebrews, without incurring harm themselves, for the Lord had sworn unto Noah never again to destroy the world by water. Thus, they assumed, they would be exempt from punishment, wherein they were wrong, however. In the first place, though the Lord had sworn not to bring a flood upon men, there was nothing in the way of bringing men into a flood. Furthermore, the oath of God applied to the whole of mankind, not to a single nation. The end of the Egyptians was that they met their death in the billows of the Red Sea. \"Measure for measure\"—as they had drowned the men children of the Israelites, so they were drowned. Pharaoh now took steps looking to the faithful execution of his decree. He sent his bailiffs into the houses of the Israelites, to discover all new-born children, wherever they might be. To make sure that the Hebrews should not succeed in keeping the children hidden, the Egyptians hatched a devilish plan. Their women were to take their little ones to the houses of the Israelitish women that were suspected of having infants. When the Egyptian children began to cry or coo, the Hebrew children that were kept in hiding would join in, after the manner of babies, and betray their presence, whereupon the Egyptians would seize them and bear them off. Furthermore, Pharaoh commanded that the Israelitish women employ none but Egyptian midwives, who were to secure precise information as to the time of their delivery, and were to exercise great care, and let no male child escape their vigilance alive. If there should be parents that evaded the command, and preserved a new-born boy in secret, they and all belonging to them were to be killed. Is it to be wondered at, then, that many of the Hebrews kept themselves away from their wives? Nevertheless those who put trust in God were not forsaken by Him. The women that remained united with their husbands would go out into the field when their time of delivery arrived, and give birth to their children and leave them there, while they themselves returned home. The Lord, who had sworn unto their ancestors to multiply them, sent one of His angels to wash the babes, anoint them, stretch their limbs, and swathe them. Then he would give them two smooth pebbles, from one of which they sucked milk, and from the other honey. And God caused the hair of the infants to grow down to their knees and serve them as a protecting garment, and then He ordered the earth to receive the babes, that they be sheltered therein until the time of their growing up, when it would open its mouth and vomit forth the children, and they would sprout up like the herb of the field and the grass of the forest. Thereafter each would return to his family and the house of his father. When the Egyptians saw this, they went forth, every man to his field, with his yoke of oxen, and they ploughed up the earth as one ploughs it at seed time. Yet they were unable to do harm to the infants of the children of Israel that had been swallowed up and lay in the bosom of the earth. Thus the people of Israel increased and waxed exceedingly. And Pharaoh ordered his officers to go to Goshen, to look for the male babes of the children of Israel, and when they discovered one, they tore him from his mother's breast by force, and thrust him into the river.\" But no one is so valiant as to be able to foil God's purposes, though he contrive ten thousand subtle devices unto that end. The child foretold by Pharaoh's dreams and by his astrologers was brought up and kept concealed from the king's spies. It came to pass after the following manner.",

He set the example. He divorced his wife, and all the men of Israel did likewise, for he occupied a place of great consideration among his people, one reason being that he belonged to the tribe of Levi, the tribe that was faithful to its God even in the land of Egypt, though the other tribes wavered in their allegiance, and attempted to ally themselves with the Egyptians, going so far as to give up Abraham's sign of the covenant. To chastise the Hebrews for their impiety, God turned the love of the Egyptians for them into hatred, so that they resolved upon their destruction. Mindful of all that he and his people owed to Joseph's wise rule, Pharaoh refused at first to entertain the malicious plans proposed by the Egyptians against the Hebrews. He spoke to his people, \"You fools, we are indebted to these Hebrews for whatever we enjoy, and you desire now to rise up against them?\" But the Egyptians could not be turned aside from their purpose of ruining Israel. They deposed their king, and incarcerated him for three months, until he declared himself ready to execute with determination what they had resolved upon, and he sought to bring about the ruin of the children of Israel by every conceivable means. Such was the retribution they had drawn down upon themselves by their own acts. As for Amram, not only did he belong to the tribe of Levi, distinguished for its piety, but by reason of his extraordinary piety he was prominent even among the pious of the tribe. He was one of the four who were immaculate, untainted by sin, over whom death would have had no power, had mortality not been decreed against every single human being on account of the fall of the first man and woman. The other three that led the same sinless life were Benjamin, Jesse the father of David, and Chileab the son of David. If the Shekinah was drawn close again to the dwelling-place of mortals, it was due to Amram's piety. Originally the real residence of the Shekinah was among men, but when Adam committed his sin, she withdrew to heaven, at first to the lowest of the seven heavens. Thence she was banished by Cain's crime, and she retired to the second heaven. The sins of the generation of Enoch removed her still farther off from men, she took up her abode in the third heaven; then, successively, in the fourth, on account of the malefactors in the generation of the deluge; in the fifth, during the building of the tower of Babel and the confusion of tongues; in the sixth, by reason of the wicked Egyptians at the time of Abraham; and, finally, in the seventh, in consequence of the abominations of the inhabitants of Sodom. Six righteous men, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Levi, Kohath, and Amram, drew the Shekinah back, one by one, from the seventh to the first heaven, and through the seventh righteous man, Moses, she was made to descend to the earth and abide among men as aforetime. Amram's sagacity kept pace with his piety and his learning. The Egyptians succeeded in enslaving the Hebrews by seductive promises. At first they gave them a shekel for every brick they made, tempting them to superhuman efforts by the prospect of earning much money. Later, when the Egyptians forced them to work without wages, they insisted upon having as many bricks as the Hebrews had made when their labor was paid for, but they could demand only a single brick daily from Amram, for he had been the only one whom they had not led astray by their artifice. He had been satisfied with a single shekel daily, and had therefore made only a single brick daily, which they had to accept afterward as the measure of his day's work. As his life partner, Amram chose his aunt Jochebed, who was born the same day with him. She was the daughter of Levi, and she owed her name, \"Divine Splendor,\" to the celestial light that radiated from her countenance. She was worthy of being her husband's helpmeet, for she was one of the midwives that had imperilled their own lives to rescue the little Hebrew babes. Indeed, if God had not allowed a miracle to happen, she and her daughter Miriam would have been killed by Pharaoh for having resisted his orders and saved the Hebrew children alive. When the king sent his hangmen for the two women, God caused them to become invisible, and the bailiffs bad to return without accomplishing their errand. The first child of the union between Amram and Jochebed, his wife, who was one hundred and twenty-six years old at the time of her marriage, was a girl, and the mother called her Miriam, \"Bitterness,\" for it was at the time of her birth that the Egyptians began to envenom the life of the Hebrews. The second child was a boy, called Aaron, which means, \"Woe unto this pregnancy!\" because Pharaoh's instructions to the midwives, to kill the male children of the Hebrews, was proclaimed during the months before Aaron's birth.",

      "content": "When Amram separated from his wife on account of the edict published against the male children of the Hebrews, and his example was followed by all the Israelites, his daughter Miriam said to him: \"Father, thy decree is worse than Pharaoh's decree. The Egyptians aim to destroy only the male children, but thou includest the girls as well. Pharaoh deprives his victims of life in this world, but thou preventest children from being born, and thus thou deprivest them of the future life, too. He resolves destruction, but who knows whether the intention of the wicked can persist? Thou art a righteous man, and the enactments of the righteous are executed by God, hence thy decree will be upheld.\" Amram recognized the justice of her plea, and he repaired to the Sanhedrin, and put the matter before this body. The members of the court spoke, and said: \"It was thou that didst separate husbands and wives, and from thee should go forth the permission for re-marriage.\" Amram then made the proposition that each of the members of the Sanhedrin return to his wife, and wed her clandestinely, but his colleagues repudiated the plan, saying, \"And who will make it known unto the whole of Israel? \" Accordingly, Amram stood publicly under the wedding canopy with his divorced wife Jochebed, while Aaron and Miriam danced about it, and the angels proclaimed, \"Let the mother of children be joyful!\" His re-marriage was solemnized with great ceremony, to the end that the men that bad followed his example in divorcing their wives might imitate him now in taking them again unto themselves. And so it happened. Old as Jochebed was, she regained her youth. Her skin became soft, the wrinkles in her face disappeared, the warm tints of maiden beauty returned, and in a short time she became pregnant. Amram was very uneasy about his wife's being with child; he knew not what to do. He turned to God in prayer, and entreated Him to have compassion upon those who had in no wise transgressed the laws of His worship, and afford them deliverance from the misery they endured, while He rendered abortive the hope of their enemies, who yearned for the destruction of their nation. God had mercy on him, and He stood by him in his sleep, and exhorted him not to despair of His future favors. He said further, that He did not forget their piety, and He would always reward them for it, as He had granted His favor in other days unto their forefathers. \"Know, therefore,\" the Lord continued to speak, \"that I shall provide for you all together what is for your good, and for thee in particular that which shall make thee celebrated; for the child out of dread of whose nativity the Egyptians have doomed the Israelite children to destruction, shall be this child of thine, and be shall remain concealed from those who watch to destroy him, and when he has been bred up, in a miraculous way, he shall deliver the Hebrew nation from the distress they are under by reason of the Egyptians. His memory shall be celebrated while the world lasts, and not only among the Hebrews, but among strangers also. And all this shall be the effect of My favor toward thee and thy posterity. Also his brother shall be such that he shall obtain My priesthood for himself, and for his posterity after him, unto the end of the world.\" After he had been informed of these things by the vision, Amram awoke, and told all unto his wife Jochebed. His daughter Miriam likewise had a prophetic dream, and she related it unto her parents, saying: \"In this night I saw a man clothed in fine linen. 'Tell thy father and thy mother,' he said, 'that he who shall be born unto them, shall be cast into the waters, and through him the waters shall become dry, and wonders and miracles shall be performed through him, and he shall save My people Israel, and be their leader forever.' \" During her pregnancy, Jochebed observed that the child in her womb was destined for great things. All the time she suffered no pain, and also she suffered none in giving birth to her son, for pious women are not included in the curse pronounced upon Eve, decreeing sorrow in conception and in childbearing. At the moment of the child's appearance, the whole house was filled with radiance equal to the splendor of the sun and the moon. A still greater miracle followed. The infant was not yet a day old when he began to walk and speak with his parents, and as though he were an adult, he refused to drink milk from his mother's breast. Jochebed gave birth to the child six months after conception. The Egyptian bailiffs, who kept strict watch over all pregnant women in order to be on the spot in time to carry off their new-born boys, had not expected her delivery for three months more. These three months the parents succeeded in keeping the babe concealed, though every Israelitish house was guarded by two Egyptian women, one stationed within and one without. At the end of this time they determined to expose the child, for Amram was afraid that both he and his son would be devoted to death if the secret leaked out, and he thought it better to entrust the child's fate to Divine Providence. He was convinced that God would protect the boy, and fulfil His word in truth.",

      "content": "Jochebed accordingly took an ark fashioned of bulrushes, daubed it with pitch on the outside, and lined it with clay within. The reason she used bulrushes was because they float on the surface of the water, and she put pitch only on the outside, to protect the child as much as possible against the annoyance of a disagreeable odor. Over the child as it lay in the ark she spread a tiny canopy, to shade the babe, with the words, \"Perhaps I shall not live to see him under the marriage canopy.\" And then she abandoned the ark on the shores of the Red Sea. Yet it was not left unguarded. Her daughter Miriam stayed near by, to discover whether a prophecy she had uttered would be fulfilled. Before the child's birth, his sister had foretold that her mother would bring forth a son that should redeem Israel. When he was born, and the house was filled with brilliant light, Amram kissed her on her head, but when he was forced into the expedient of exposing the child, he beat her on her head, saying, \"My daughter, what hath become of thy prophecy?\" Therefore Miriam stayed, and strolled along the shore, to observe what would be the fate of the babe, and what would come of her prophecy concerning him. The day the child was exposed was the twenty-first of the month of Nisan, the same on which the children of Israel later, under the leadership of Moses, sang the song of praise and gratitude to God for the redemption from the waters of the sea. The angels appeared before God, and spoke: \"O Lord of the world, shall he that is appointed to sing a song of praise unto Thee on this day of Nisan, to thank Thee for rescuing him and his people from the sea, shall he find his death in the sea to-day?\" The Lord replied: \"Ye know well that I see all things. The contriving of man can do naught to change what bath been resolved in My counsel. Those do not attain their end who use cunning and malice to secure their own safety, and endeavor to bring ruin upon their fellow-men. But he who trusts Me in his peril will be conveyed from profoundest distress to unlooked-for happiness. Thus My omnipotence will reveal itself in the fortunes of this babe. At the time of the child's abandonment, God sent scorching heat to plague the Egyptians, and they all suffered with leprosy and smarting boils. Thermutis, the daughter of Pharaoh, sought relief from the burning pain in a bath in the waters of the Nile. But physical discomfort was not her only reason for leaving her father's palace. She was determined to cleanse herself as well of the impurity of the idol worship that prevailed there. When she saw the little ark floating among the flags on the surface of the water, she supposed it to contain one of the little children exposed at her father's order, and she commanded her handmaids to fetch it. But they protested, saying, \"O our mistress, it happens sometimes that a decree issued by a king is unheeded, yet it is observed at least by his children and the members of his household, and dost thou desire to transgress thy father's edict?\" Forthwith the angel Gabriel appeared, seized all the maids except one, whom he permitted the princess to retain for her service, and buried them in the bowels of the earth. Pharaoh's daughter now proceeded to do her own will. She stretched forth her arm, and although the ark was swimming at a distance of sixty ells, she succeeded in grasping it, because her arm was lengthened miraculously. No sooner had she touched it than the leprosy afflicting her departed from her. Her sudden restoration led her to examine the contents of the ark, and when she opened it, her amazement was great. She beheld an exquisitely beautiful boy, for God bad fashioned the Hebrew babe's body with peculiar care, and beside it she perceived the Shekinah. Noticing that the boy bore the sign of the Abrahamic covenant, she knew that he was one of the Hebrew children, and mindful of her father's decree concerning the male children of the Israelites, she was about to abandon the babe to his fate. At that moment the angel Gabriel came and gave the child a vigorous blow, and he began to cry aloud, with a voice like a young man's. His vehement weeping and the weeping of Aaron, who was lying beside him, touched the princess, and in her pity she resolved to save him. She ordered an Egyptian woman to be brought, to nurse the child, but the little one refused to take milk from her breast, as he refused to take it from one after the other of the Egyptian women fetched thither. Thus it had been ordained by God, that none of them might boast later on, and say, \"I suckled him that holds converse now with the Shekinah.\" Nor was the mouth destined to speak with God to draw nourishment from the unclean body of an Egyptian woman. Now Miriam stepped into the presence of Thermutis, as though she had been standing there by chance to look at the child, and she spoke to the princess, saying, \"It is vain for thee, O queen, to call for nurses that are in no wise of kin to the child, but if thou wilt order a woman of the Hebrews to be brought, he may accept her breast, seeing that she is of his own nation.\" Thermutis therefore bade Miriam fetch a Hebrew woman, and with winged steps, speeding like a vigorous youth, she hastened and brought back her own mother, the child's mother, for she knew that none present was acquainted with her. The babe, unresisting, took his mother's breast, and clutched it tightly. The princess committed the child to Jochebed's care, saying these words, which contained an unconscious divination: \"Here is what is thine.\" Nurse the boy henceforth, and I will give thee two silver pieces as thy wages. The return of her son, safe and sound, after she had exposed him, was Jochebed's reward from God for her services as one of the midwives that had bidden defiance to Pharaoh's command and saved the Hebrew children alive. By exposing their son to danger, Amram and Jochebed had effected the withdrawal of Pharaoh's command enjoining the extermination of the Hebrew men children. The day Moses was set adrift in the little ark, the astrologers had come to Pharaoh and told him the glad tidings, that the danger threatening the Egyptians on account of one boy, whose doom lay in the water, had now been averted. Thereupon Pharaoh cried a halt to the drowning of the boys of his empire. The astrologers had seen something, but they knew not what, and they announced a message, the import of which they did not comprehend. Water was, indeed, the doom of Moses, but that did not mean that he would perish in the waters of the Nile. It had reference to the waters of Meribah, the waters of strife, and how they would cause his death in the desert, before he had completed his task of leading the people into the promised land. Pharaoh, misled by the obscure vision of his astrologers, thought that the future redeemer of Israel was to lose his life by drowning, and to make sure that the boy whose appearance was foretold by the astrologers might not escape his fate, he had ordered all boys, even the children of the Egyptians, born during a period of nine months to be cast into the water. On account of the merits of Moses, the six hundred thousand men children of the Hebrews begotten in the same night with him, and thrown into the water on the same day, were rescued miraculously together with him, and it was therefore not an idle boast, if he said later, \"The people that went forth out of the water on account of my merits are six hundred thousand men.\"",

      "content": "For two years the child rescued by Pharaoh's daughter stayed with his parents and kindred. They gave him various names. His father called him Heber, because it was for this child's sake that he had been \"reunited\" with his wife. His mother's name for him was Jekuthiel, \"because,\" she said, \"I set my hope upon God, and He gave him back to me.\" To his sister Miriam he was Jered, because she had \"descended\" to the stream to ascertain his fate. His brother Aaron called him Abi Zanoah, because his father, who had \"cast off\" his mother, had taken her back for the sake of the child to be born. His grandfather Kohath knew him as Abi Gedor, because the Heavenly Father had \"built up\" the breach in Israel, when He rescued him, and thus restrained the Egyptians from throwing the Hebrew men children into the water. His nurse called him Abi Soco, because he had been kept concealed in a \"tent\" for three months, escaping the pursuit of the Egyptians. And Israel called him Shemaiah ben Nethanel, because in his day God would \"hear\" the sighs of the people, and deliver them from their oppressors, and through him would He \"give\" them His own law. His kindred and all Israel knew that the child was destined for great things, for he was barely four months old when he began to prophesy, saying, \"In days to come I shall receive the Torah from the flaming torch.\" When Jochebed took the child to the palace at the end of two years, Pharaoh's daughter called him Moses, because she had \"drawn\" him out of the water, and because he would \"draw\" the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt in a day to come. And this was the only name whereby God called the son of Amram, the name conferred upon him by Pharaoh's daughter. He said to the princess: \"Moses was not thy child, yet thou didst treat him as such. For this I will call thee My daughter, though thou art not My daughter,\" and therefore the princess, the daughter of Pharaoh, bears the name Bithiah, \"the daughter of God.\" She married Caleb later on, and he was a suitable husband for her. As she stood up against her father's wicked counsels, so Caleb stood up against the counsel of his fellow-messengers sent to spy out the land of Canaan. For rescuing Moses and for her other pious deeds, she was permitted to enter Paradise alive. That Moses might receive the treatment at court usually accorded to a prince, Bithiah pretended that she was with child for some time before she had him fetched away from his parents' house.\" His royal foster-mother caressed and kissed him constantly, and on account of his extraordinary beauty she would not permit him ever to quit the palace. Whoever set eyes on him, could not leave off from looking at him, wherefore Bithiah feared to allow him out of her sight. Moses' understanding was far beyond his years; his instructors observed that he disclosed keener comprehension than is usual at his age. All his actions in his infancy promised greater ones after he should come to man's estate, and when he was but three years old, God granted him remarkable size. As for his beauty, it was so attractive that frequently those meeting him as he was carried along on the road were obliged to turn and stare at him. They would leave what they were about, and stand still a great while, looking after him, for the loveliness of the child was so wondrous that it held the gaze of the spectator. The daughter of Pharaoh, perceiving Moses to be an extraordinary lad, adopted him as her son, for she had no child of her own. She informed her father of her intention concerning him, in these words: \"I have brought up a child, who is divine in form and of an excellent mind, and as I received him through the bounty of the river in a wonderful way, I have thought it proper to adopt him as my son and as the heir of thy kingdom.\" And when she had spoken thus, she put the infant between her father's hands, and he took him and hugged him close to his breast.",

      "content": "When Moses was in his third year, Pharaoh was dining one day, with the queen Alfar'anit at his right hand, his daughter Bithiah with the infant Moses upon her lap at his left, and Balaam the son of Beor together with his two sons and all the princes of the realm sitting at table in the king's presence. It happened that the infant took the crown from off the king's head, and placed it on his own. When the king and the princes saw this, they were terrified, and each one in turn expressed his astonishment. The king said unto the princes, \"What speak you, and what say you, O ye princes, on this matter, and what is to be done to this Hebrew boy on account of this act?\" Balaam spoke, saying: \"Remember now, O my lord and king, the dream which thou didst dream many days ago, and how thy servant interpreted it unto thee. Now this is a child of the Hebrews in whom is the spirit of God. Let not my lord the king imagine in his heart that being a child he did the thing without knowledge. For he is a Hebrew boy, and wisdom and understanding are with him, although he is yet a child, and with wisdom has he done this, and chosen unto himself the kingdom of Egypt. For this is the manner of all the Hebrews, to deceive kings and their magnates, to do all things cunningly in order to make the kings of the earth and their men to stumble. \"Surely thou knowest that Abraham their father acted thus, who made the armies of Nimrod king of Babel and of Abimelech king of Gerar to stumble, and he possessed himself of the land of the children of Heth and the whole realm of Canaan. Their father Abraham went down into Egypt, and said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister, in order to make Egypt and its king to stumble. \"His son Isaac did likewise when he went to Gerar, and he dwelt there, and his strength prevailed over the army of Abimelech, and he intended to make the kingdom of the Philistines to stumble, by saying that Rebekah his wife was his sister. \"Jacob also dealt treacherously with his brother, and took his birthright and his blessing from him. Then he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban, his mother's brother, and he obtained his daughters from him cunningly, and also his cattle and all his belongings, and he fled away and returned to the land of Canaan, to his father. \"His sons sold their brother Joseph, and he went down into Egypt and became a slave, and he was put into prison for twelve years, until the former Pharaoh delivered him from the prison, and magnified him above all the princes of Egypt on account of his interpreting the king's dreams. When God caused a famine to descend upon the whole world, Joseph sent for his father, and he brought him down into Egypt his father, his brethren, and all his father's household, and he supplied them with food without pay or reward, while he acquired Egypt, and made slaves of all its inhabitants. \"Now, therefore, my lord king, behold, this child has risen up in their stead in Egypt, to do according to their deeds and make sport of every man, be he king, prince, or judge. If it please the king, let us now spill his blood upon the ground, lest he grow up and snatch the government from thine hand, and the hope of Egypt be cut off after he reigns. Let us, moreover, call for all the judges and the wise men of Egypt, that we may know whether the judgment of death be due to this child, as I have said, and then we will slay him.\" Pharaoh sent and called for all the wise men of Egypt, and they came, and the angel Gabriel was disguised as one of them. When they were asked their opinion in the matter, Gabriel spoke up, and said: \"If it please the king, let him place an onyx stone before the child, and a coal of fire, and if he stretches out his hand and grasps the onyx stone, then shall we know that the child hath done with wisdom all that he bath done, and we will slay him. But if he stretches out his hand and grasps the coal of fire, then shall we know that it was not with consciousness that he did the thing, and he shall live.\" The counsel seemed good in the eyes of the king, and when they had placed the stone and the coal before the child, Moses stretched forth his hand toward the onyx stone and attempted to seize it, but the angel Gabriel guided his hand away from it and placed it upon the live coal, and the coal burnt the child's hand, and he lifted it up and touched it to his mouth, and burnt part of his lips and part of his tongue, and for all his life he became slow of speech and of a slow tongue. Seeing this, the king and the princes knew that Moses had not acted with knowledge in taking the crown from off the king's head, and they refrained from slaying him. God Himself, who protected Moses, turned the king's mind to grace, and his foster-mother snatched him away, and she had him educated with great care, so that the Hebrews depended upon him, and cherished the hope that great things would be done by him. But the Egyptians were suspicious of what would follow from such an education as his. At great cost teachers were invited to come to Egypt from neighboring lands, to educate the child Moses. Some came of their own accord, to instruct him in the sciences and the liberal arts. By reason of his admirable endowments of mind, he soon excelled his teachers in knowledge. His learning seemed a process of mere recollecting, and when there was a difference of opinion among scholars, he selected the correct one instinctively, for his mind refused to store up anything that was false. But he deserves more praise for his unusual strength of will than for his natural capacity, for he succeeded in transforming an originally evil disposition into a noble, exalted character, a change that was farther aided by his resolution, as he himself acknowledged later. After the wonderful exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, a king of Arabia sent an artist to Moses, to paint his portrait, that he might always have the likeness of the divine man before him. The painter returned with his handiwork, and the king assembled his wise men, those in particular who were conversant with the science of physiognomy. He displayed the portrait before them, and invited their judgment upon it. The unanimous opinion was that it represented a man covetous, haughty, sensual, in short, disfigured by all possible ugly traits. The king was indignant that they should pretend to be masters in physiognomy, seeing that they declared the picture of Moses, the holy, divine man, to be the picture of a villain. They defended themselves by accusing the painter in turn of not having produced a true portrait of Moses, else they would not have fallen into the erroneous judgment they had expressed. But the artist insisted that his work resembled the original closely. Unable to decide who was right, the Arabian king went to see Moses, and he could not but admit that the portrait painted for him was a masterpiece. Moses as he beheld him in the flesh was the Moses upon the canvas. There could be no doubt but that the highly extolled knowledge of his physiognomy experts was empty twaddle. He told Moses what had happened, and what he thought of it. He replied: \"Thy artist and thy experts alike are masters, each in his line. If my fine qualities were a product of nature, I were no better than a log of wood, which remains forever as nature produced it at the first. Unashamed I make the confession to thee that by nature I possessed all the reprehensible traits thy wise men read in my picture and ascribed to me, perhaps to a greater degree even than they think. But I mastered my evil impulses with my strong will, and the character I acquired through severe discipline has become the opposite of the disposition with which I was born. Through this change, wrought in me by my own efforts, I have earned honor and commendation upon earth as well as in heaven.\"",

      "content": "One day—it was after he was grown up, and had passed beyond the years of childhood—Moses went to the land of Goshen, in which lived the children of Israel. There he saw the burdens under which his people were groaning, and he inquired why the heavy service had been put upon them. The Israelites told him all that had befallen, told him of the cruel edict Pharaoh had issued shortly before his birth, and told him of the wicked counsels given by Balaam against themselves as well as against his person when he was but a little boy and had set Pharaoh's crown upon his head. The wrath of Moses was kindled against the spiteful adviser, and he tried to think out means of rendering him harmless. But Balaam, getting wind of his ill-feeling, fled from Egypt with his two sons, and betook himself to the court of Kikanos king of Ethiopia. The sight of his enslaved people touched Moses unto tears, and he spoke, saying: \"Woe unto me for your anguish! Rather would I die than see you suffer so grievously.\" He did not disdain to help his unfortunate brethren at their heavy tasks as much as lay in his power. He dismissed all thought of his high station at court, shouldered a share of the burdens put upon the Israelites, and toiled in their place. The result was that he not only gave relief to the heavily-laden workmen, but he also gained the favor of Pharaoh, who believed that Moses was taking part in the labor in order to promote the execution of the royal order. And God said unto Moses: \"Thou didst relinquish all thy other occupations, and didst join thyself unto the children of Israel, whom thou dost treat as brethren; therefore will I, too, put aside now all heavenly and earthly affairs, and hold converse with thee.\" Moses continued to do all he could to alleviate the suffering of his brethren to the best of his ability. He addressed encouraging words to them, saying: \"My dear brethren, bear your lot with fortitude! Do not lose courage, and let not your spirit grow weary with the weariness of your body. Better times will come, when tribulation shall be changed into joy. Clouds are followed by sunshine, storms by calm, all things in the world tend toward their opposites, and nothing is more inconstant than the fortunes of man.\" The royal favor, which the king accorded him in everincreasing measure, he made use of to lighten the burden laid upon the children of Israel. One day he came into the presence of Pharaoh, and said: \"O my lord, I have a request to make of thee, and my hope is that thou wilt not deny it.\" \"Speak,\" replied the king. \"It is an admitted fact,\" said Moses, \"that if a slave is not afforded rest at least one day in the week, he will die of overexertion. Thy Hebrew slaves will surely perish, unless thou accordest them a day of cessation from work.\" Pharaoh fulfilled the petition preferred by Moses, and the king's edict was published in the whole of Egypt and in Goshen, as follows: \"To the sons of Israel! Thus saith the king: Do your work and perform your service for six days, but on the seventh day you shall rest; on it ye shall do no labor. Thus shall ye do unto all times, according to the command of the king and the command of Moses the son of Bithiah.\" And the day appointed by Moses as the day of rest was Saturday, later given by God to the Israelites as the Sabbath day. While Moses abode in Goshen, an incident of great importance occurred. To superintend the service of the children of Israel, an officer from among them was set over every ten, and ten such officers were under the surveillance of an Egyptian taskmaster. One of these Hebrew officers, Dathan by name, had a wife, Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan, who was of extraordinary beauty, but inclined to be very loquacious. Whenever the Egyptian taskmaster set over her husband came to their house on business connected with his office, she would approach him pleasantly and enter into conversation with him. The beautiful Israelitish woman enkindled a mad passion in his breast, and he sought and found a cunning way of satisfying his lustful desire. One day he appeared at break of dawn at the house of Dathan, roused him from his sleep, and ordered him to hurry his detachment of men to their work. The husband scarcely out of sight, he executed the villainy he had planned, and dishonored the woman, and the fruit of this illicit relation was the blasphemer of the Name whom Moses ordered to execution on the march through the desert. At the moment when the Egyptian slipped out of Shelomith's chamber, Dathan returned home. Vexed that his crime had come to the knowledge of the injured husband, the taskmaster goaded him on to work with excessive vigor, and dealt him blow after blow with the intention to kill him. Young Moses happened to visit the place at which the much-abused and tortured Hebrew was at work. Dathan hastened toward him, and complained of all the wrong and suffering the Egyptian had inflicted upon him. Full of wrath, Moses, whom the holy spirit had acquainted with the injury done the Hebrew officer by the Egyptian taskmaster, cried out to the latter, saying: \"Not enough that thou hast dishonored this man's wife, thou aimest to kill him, too?\" And turning to God, he spoke further: \"What will become of Thy promise to Abraham, that his posterity shall be as numerous as the stars, if his children are given over to death? And what will become of the revelation on Sinai, if the children of Israel are exterminated?\" Moses wanted to see if someone would step forward, and, impelled by zeal for the cause of God and for God's law, would declare himself ready to avenge the outrage. He waited in vain. Then he determined to act himself. Naturally enough he hesitated to take the life of a human being. He did not know whether the evil-doer might not be brought to repentance, and then lead a life of pious endeavor. He also considered, that there would perhaps be some among the descendants to spring from the Egyptian for whose sake their wicked ancestor might rightfully lay claim to clemency. The holy spirit allayed all his doubts. He was made to see that not the slightest hope existed that good would come either from the malefactor himself or from any of his offspring. Then Moses was willing to requite him for his evil deeds. Nevertheless he first consulted the angels, to hear what they had to say, and they agreed that the Egyptian deserved death, and Moses acted according to their opinion. Neither physical strength nor a weapon was needed to carry out his purpose. He merely pronounced the Name of God, and the Egyptian was a corpse. To the bystanders, the Israelites, Moses said: \"The Lord compared you unto the sand of the sea-shore, and as the sand moves noiselessly from place to place, so I pray you to keep the knowledge of what hath happened a secret within yourselves. Let nothing be heard concerning it.\" The wish expressed by Moses was not honored. The slaying of the Egyptian remained no secret, and those who betrayed it were Israelites, Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Pallu, of the tribe of Reuben, notorious for their effrontery and contentiousness. The day after the thing with the Egyptians happened, the two brothers began of malice aforethought to scuffle with each other, only in order to draw Moses into the quarrel and create an occasion for his betrayal. The plan succeeded admirably. Seeing Dathan raise his hand against Abiram, to deal him a blow, Moses exclaimed, \"O thou art a villain, to lift up thy hand against an Israelite, even if he is no better than thou.\" Dathan replied: \"Young man, who hath made thee to be a judge over us, thou that hast not yet attained to years of maturity? We know very well that thou art the son of Jochebed, though people call thee the son of the princess Bithiah, and if thou shouldst attempt to play the part of our master and judge, we will publish abroad the thing thou didst unto the Egyptian. Or, peradventure, thou harborest the intention to slay us as thou didst slay him, by pronouncing the Name of God?\" Not satisfied with these taunts, the noble pair of brothers betook themselves to Pharaoh, and spoke before him, \"Moses dishonoreth thy royal mantle and thy crown,\" to which Pharaoh returned, saying, \"Much good may it do him!\" But they pursued the subject. \"He helps thine enemies, Pharaoh,\" they continued, whereupon he replied, as before, \"Much good may it do him!\" Still they went on, \"He is not the son of thy daughter.\" These last words did not fail of making an impression upon Pharaoh. A royal command was issued for the arrest of Moses, and he was condemned to death by the sword. The angels came to God, and said, \"Moses, the familiar of Thine house, is held under restraint,\" and God replied, \"I will espouse his cause.\" \"But,\" the angels urged, \"his verdict of death has been pronounced—yes, they are leading him to execution,\" and again God made reply, as before, \"I will espouse his cause.\" Moses mounted the scaffold, and a sword, sharp beyond compare, was set upon his neck ten times, but it always slipped away, because his neck was as hard as ivory. And a still greater miracle came to pass. God sent down the angel Michael, in the guise of a hangman, and the human hangman charged by Pharaoh with the execution was changed into the form of Moses. This spurious Moses the angel killed with the very sword with which the executioner had purposed to slay the intended victim. Meantime Moses took to flight. Pharaoh ordered his pursuit, but it was in vain. The king's troops were partly stricken with blindness partly with dumbness. The dumb could give no information about the abiding-place of Moses, and the blind, though they knew where it was, could not get to it.",

      "content": "An angel of God took Moses to a spot removed forty days' journey from Egypt, so far off that all fear was banished from his mind. Indeed, his anxiety had never been for his own person, but only on account of the future of Israel. The subjugation of his people had always been an unsolved enigma to him. Why should Israel, he would ask himself, suffer more than all the other nations? But when his personal straits initiated him in the talebearing and backbiting that prevailed among the Israelites, then he asked himself, Does this people deserve to be redeemed? The religious conditions among the children of Israel were of such kind at that time as not to permit them to hope for Divine assistance. They refused to give ear to Aaron and the five sons of Zerah, who worked among them as prophets, and admonished them unto the fear of God. It was on account of their impiety that the heavy hand of Pharaoh rested upon them more and more oppressively, until God had mercy upon them, and sent Moses to deliver them from the slavery of Egypt. When he succeeded in effecting his escape from the hands of the hangman, Moses had no idea that a royal throne awaited him. It was nevertheless so. A war broke out at this time between Ethiopia and the nations of the East that had been subject to it until then. Kikanos, the king, advanced against the enemy with a great army. He left Balaam and Balaam's two sons, Jannes and Jambres, behind, to keep guard over his capital and take charge of the people remaining at home. The absence of the king gave Balaam the opportunity of winning his subjects over to his side, and he was put upon the throne, and his two sons were set over the army as generals. To cut Kikanos off from his capital, Balaam and his sons invested the city, so that none could enter it against their will. On two sides they made the walls higher, on the third they dug a network of canals, into which they conducted the waters of the river girding the whole land of Ethiopia, and on the fourth side their magic arts collected a large swarm of snakes and scorpions. Thus none could depart, and none could enter. Meantime Kikanos succeeded in subjugating the rebellious nations. When he returned at the head of his victorious army, and espied the high city wall from afar, he and his men said: \"The inhabitants of the city, seeing that the war detained us abroad for a long time, have raised the walls and fortified them, that the kings of Canaan may not be able to enter.\" On approaching the city gates, which were barred, they cried out to the guards to open them, but by Balaam's instructions they were not permitted to pass through. A skirmish ensued, in which Kikanos lost one hundred and thirty men. On the morrow the combat was continued, the king with his troops being stationed on the thither bank of the river. This day he lost his thirty riders, who, mounted on their steeds, had attempted to swim the stream. Then the king ordered rafts to be constructed for the transporting of his men. When the vessels reached the canals, they were submerged, and the waters, swirling round and round as though driven by mill wheels, swept away two hundred men, twenty from each raft. On the third day they set about assaulting the city from the side on which the snakes and scorpions swarmed, but they failed to reach it, and the reptiles killed one hundred and seventy men. The king desisted from attacking the city, but for the space of nine years he surrounded it, so that none could come out or go in. While the siege was in progress, Moses appeared in the king's camp on his flight before Pharaoh, and at once found favor with Kikanos and his whole army. He exercised an attraction upon all that saw him, for he was slender like a palm-tree, his countenance shone as the morning sun, and his strength was equal to a lion's. So deep was the king's affection for him that he appointed him to be commander-in-chief of his forces. At the end of the nine years Kikanos fell a prey to a mortal disease, and he died on the seventh day of his illness. His servants embalmed him, buried him opposite to the city gate toward the land of Egypt, and over his grave they erected a magnificent structure, strong and high, upon the walls whereof they engraved all the mighty deeds and battles of the dead king. Now, after the death of Kikanos, his men were greatly grieved on account of the war. One said unto the other, \"Counsel us, what shall we do at this time? We have been abiding in the wilderness, away from our homes, for nine years. If we fight against the city, many of us will fall dead; and if we remain here besieging it, we shall also die. For now all the princes of Aram and of the children of the East will hear that our king is dead, and they will attack us suddenly, and they will fight with us until not a remnant will be left. Now, therefore, let us go and set a king over us, and we will remain here besieging the city until it surrenders unto us.\"",

      "content": "They could find none except Moses fit to be their king. They hastened and stripped off each man his upper garment, and cast them all in a heap upon the ground, making a high place, on top of which they set Moses. Then they blew with trumpets, and called out before him: \"Long live the king! Long live the king!\" And all the people and the nobles swore unto him to give him Adoniah for wife, the Ethiopian queen, the widow of Kikanos. And they made Moses king over them on that day. They also issued a proclamation, commanding every man to give Moses of what he possessed, and upon the high place they spread a sheet, wherein each one cast something, this one a gold nose ring, that one a coin, and onyx stones, bdellium, pearls, gold, and silver in great abundance. Moses was twenty-seven years old when he became king over Ethiopia, and he reigned for forty years. On the seventh day of his reign, all the people assembled and came before him, to ask his counsel as to what was to be done to the city they were besieging. The king answered them, and said: \"If you will hearken to my words, the city will be delivered into our hands. Proclaim with a loud voice throughout the whole camp, unto all the people, saying: 'Thus saith the king! Go to the forest and fetch hither of the young of the stork, each man one fledgling in his hand. And if there be any man that transgresseth the word of the king, not to bring a bird, he shall die, and the king shall take all belonging to him.' And when you have brought them, they shall be in your keeping. You shall rear them until they grow up, and you shall teach them to fly as the hawk flieth.\" All the people did according to the word of Moses, and after the young storks had grown to full size, he ordered them to be starved for three days. On the third day the king said unto them, \"Let every man put on his armor and gird his sword upon him. Each one shall mount his horse, and each shall set his stork upon his hand, and we will rise up and fight against the city opposite to the place of the serpents.\" When they came to the appointed spot, the king said to them, \"Let each man send forth his young stork, to descend upon the serpents.\" Thus they did, and the birds swooped down and devoured all the reptiles and destroyed them. After the serpents were removed in this way, the men fought against the city, subdued it, and killed all its inhabitants, but of the people besieging it there died not one. When Balaam saw that the city had fallen into the hands of the besiegers, he exercised his magic arts, which enabled him to fly through the air, and he carried with him his two sons, Jannes and Jambres, and his eight brothers, and they all took refuge in Egypt. Seeing that they had been saved by the king, and the city had been taken by his good counsel, the people became more than ever attached to him. They set the royal crown upon his head, and gave him Adoniah, the widow of Kikanos to wife. But Moses feared the stern God of his fathers, and he went not in unto Adoniah, nor did he turn his eyes toward her, for he remembered how Abraham had made his servant Eliezer swear, saying unto him, \"Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.\" He also remembered what Isaac did when Jacob fled before his brother Esau, how he commanded his son, saying, \"Thou shalt not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan, nor ally thyself by marriage with any of the children of Ham, for the Lord our God gave Ham the son of Noah and all his seed as slaves to the children of Shem and Japheth forever.\" At that time Aram and the children of the East heard that Kikanos the king of Ethiopia had died, and they rose up against the Ethiopians, but Moses went forth with a mighty army to fight against the rebellious nations, and he subdued them, first the children of the East and then Aram. Moses continued to prosper in his kingdom. He conducted the government in justice, righteousness, and integrity, and his people loved and feared him. In the fortieth year of his reign, while he was sitting upon his throne one day, surrounded by all the nobles, Adoniah the queen, who was seated before him, rose up, and spake: \"What is this thing which you, the people of Ethiopia, have done these many days? Surely you know that during the forty years this man bath reigned over you, he hath not approached me, nor hath he worshipped the gods of Ethiopia. Now, therefore, let this man reign over you no more, for he is not of our flesh. Behold, Monarchos my son is grown up, let him reign over you. It is better for you to serve the son of your lord than a stranger, a slave of the king of Egypt.\" A whole day the people and the nobles contended with one another, whether to pay heed to the words of the queen. The officers of the army remained faithful to Moses, but the people of the cities were in favor of crowning the son of their former lord as king. The following morning they rose up and made Monarchos, the son of Kikanos, king over them, but they were afraid to stretch forth their hand against Moses, for the Lord was with him. They also remembered the oath they had sworn unto Moses, and therefore they did him no harm. Moreover, they gave many presents to him, and dismissed him with great honor. When Moses left Ethiopia, in the sixty-seventh year of his age, it was the time appointed by God in the days of old to bring Israel forth from the affliction of the children of Ham. But fearing to return to Egypt on account of Pharaoh, Moses journeyed to Midian.",

      "content": "In the city of Midian, named thus for a son of Abraham by Keturah, the man Jethro had lived for many years, doing a priest's service before the idols. As time went on, he grew more and more convinced of the vanity of idol worship. His priesthood became repugnant to him, and he resolved to give up his, charge. He stood before his townsmen, and said, \"Until now I performed your service before the idols, but I have grown too old for the duties of the office. Choose, therefore, whomever you would choose in my place.\" Speaking thus, he delivered to the people all the paraphernalia appertaining to the idol worship, and bade them transfer them to the one to whom in their discretion they should entrust his position. Suspecting Jethro's hidden motives, the people put him under the ban, and none might venture to do him the slightest service. Not even would the shepherds pasture his flocks, and there was nothing for him to do but impose this work upon his seven daughters. Jethro's transformation from an idolatrous priest into a God-fearing man is conveyed by his seven names. He was called Jether, because the Torah contains an \"additional\" section about him; Jethro, he \"overflowed\" with good deeds. Hobab, \"the beloved son of God\"; Reuel, \"the friend of God\"; Heber, \"the associate of God\"; Putiel, \"he that hath renounced idolatry\"; and Keni, he that was \"zealous\" for God, and \"acquired\" the Torah. In consequence of the hostile relation between Jethro and the inhabitants of the city, his daughters were in the habit of making their appearance at the watering troughs before the other shepherds came thither. But the ruse was not successful. The shepherds would drive them away, and water their own flocks at the troughs that the maidens had filled. When Moses arrived in Midian, it was at the well that he made halt, and his experience was the same as Isaac's and Jacob's. Like them he found his helpmeet there. Rebekah had been selected by Eliezer as the wife of Isaac, while she was busy drawing water for him; Jacob had seen Rachel first, while she was watering her sheep, and at this well in Midian Moses met his future wife Zipporah. The rudeness of the shepherds reached its climax the very day of Moses' arrival. First they deprived the maidens of the water they had drawn for themselves, and attempted to do violence to them, and then they threw them into the water with intent to kill them. At this moment Moses appeared, dragged the maidens out of the water, and gave the flocks to drink, first Jethro's and then the flocks of the shepherds, though the latter did not deserve his good offices. True, he did them the service with but little trouble to himself, for he had only to draw a bucketful, and the water flowed so copiously that it sufficed for all the herds, and it did not cease to flow until Moses withdrew from the well, —the same well at which Jacob had met Rachel, his future wife, and the same well that God created at the beginning of the world, the opening of which He made in the twilight of the first Sabbath eve. Jethro's daughters thanked Moses for the assistance he had afforded them. But Moses warded off their gratitude, saying, \"Your thanks are due to the Egyptian I killed, on account of whom I had to flee from Egypt. Had it not been for him, I should not be here now.\"",

      "content": "One of the seven maidens whom Moses saw at the well attracted his notice in particular on account of her modest demeanor, and he made her a proposal of marriage. But Zipporah repulsed him, saying, \"My father has a tree in his garden with which he tests every man that expresses a desire to marry one of his daughters, and as soon as the suitor touches the tree, he is devoured by it.\" Moses: \"Whence has he the tree?\" Zipporah: \"It is the rod that the Holy One, blessed be He, created in the twilight of the first Sabbath eve, and gave to Adam. He transmitted it to Enoch, from him it descended to Noah, then to Shem, and Abraham, and Isaac, and finally to Jacob, who brought it with him to Egypt, and gave it to his son Joseph. When Joseph died, the Egyptians pillaged his house, and the rod, which was in their booty, they brought to Pharaoh's palace. At that time my father was one of the most prominent of the king's sacred scribes, and as such he had the opportunity of seeing the rod. He felt a great desire to possess it, and he stole it and took it to his house. On this rod the Ineffable Name is graven, and also the ten plagues that God will cause to visit the Egyptians in a future day. For many years it lay in my father's house. One day he was walking in his garden carrying it, and he stuck it in the ground. When he attempted to draw it out again, he found that it had sprouted, and was putting forth blossoms. That is the rod with which he tries any that desire to marry his daughters. He insists that our suitors shall attempt to pull it out of the ground, but as soon as they touch it, it devours them.\" Having given him this account of her father's rod, Zipporah went home, accompanied by her sisters, and Moses followed them. Jethro was not a little amazed to see his daughters return so soon from the watering troughs. As a rule, the chicanery they had to suffer from the shepherds detained them until late. No sooner had he heard their report about the wonderworking Egyptian than he exclaimed, \"Mayhap he is one of the descendants of Abraham, from whom issueth blessing for the whole world.\" He rebuked his daughters for not having invited the stranger that had done them so valuable a service to come into their house, and he ordered them to fetch him, in the hope that he would take one of his daughters to wife. Moses had been standing without all this time, and had allowed Jethro's daughters to describe him as an Egyptian, without protesting and asserting his Hebrew birth. For this God punished him by causing him to die outside of the promised land. Joseph, who had proclaimed in public that he was a Hebrew, found his last resting-place in the land of the Hebrews, and Moses, who apparently had no objection to being considered an Egyptian, had to live and die outside of that land. Zipporah hastened forth to execute her father's wish, and no sooner had she ushered him in than Moses requested her hand in marriage. Jethro replied, \"If thou canst bring me the rod in my garden, I will give her to thee.\" Moses went out, found the sapphire rod that God had bestowed upon Adam when he was driven forth from Paradise, the rod that had reached Jethro after manifold vicissitudes, and which he had planted in the garden. Moses uprooted it and carried it to Jethro, who conceived the idea at once that he was the prophet in Israel concerning whom all the wise men of Egypt had foretold that he would destroy their land and its inhabitants. As soon as this thought struck him, he seized Moses, and threw him into a pit, in the expectation that he would meet with death there. And, indeed, he would have perished, if Zipporah had not devised a stratagem to save his life. She said to her father: \"Would it were thy will to hearken unto my counsel. Thou hast no wife, but only seven daughters. Dost thou desire my six sisters to preside over thy household? Then shall I go abroad with the sheep. If not, let my sisters tend the flocks, and I shall take care of the house.\" Her father said: \"Thou hast spoken well. Thy six sisters shall go forth with the sheep, and thou shalt abide in the house and take care of it, and all that belongeth to me therein.\" Now Zipporah could provide Moses with all sorts of dainties as he lay in the pit, and she did it for the space of seven years. At the expiration of this period, she said to her father: \"I recollect that once upon a time thou didst cast into yonder pit a man that had fetched thy rod from the garden for thee, and thou didst commit a great trespass thereby. If it seemeth well to thee, uncover the pit and look into it. If the man is dead, throw his corpse away, lest it fill the house with stench. But should he be alive, then thou oughtest to be convinced that he is one of those who are wholly pious, else he had died of hunger.\" The reply of Jethro was: \"Thou hast spoken wisely. Dost thou remember his name?\" And Zipporah rejoined, \"I remember he called himself Moses the son of Amram.\" Jethro lost no time, he opened the pit, and called out, \"Moses! Moses!\" Moses replied, and said: \"Here am I!\" Jethro drew him up out of the pit, kissed him, and said: \"Blessed be God, who guarded thee for seven years in the pit. I acknowledge that He slayeth and reviveth, that thou art one of the wholly pious, that through thee God will destroy Egypt in time to come, lead His people out of the land, and drown Pharaoh and his whole army in the sea.\" Thereupon Jethro gave much money to Moses, and he bestowed his daughter Zipporah upon him as wife, giving her to him under the condition that the children born of the marriage in Jethro's house should be divided into two equal classes, the one to be Israelitish, the other Egyptian. When Zipporah bore him a son, Moses circumcised him, and called him Gershom, as a memorial of the wonder God had done for him, for although he lived in a \"strange\" land, the Lord had not refused him aid even \"there.\" Zipporah nursed her first child for two years, and in the third year she bore a second son. Remembering his compact with Jethro, Moses realized that his father-in-law would not permit him to circumcise this one, too, and he determined to return to Egypt, that he might have the opportunity of bringing up his second son as an Israelite. On the journey thither, Satan appeared to him in the guise of a serpent, and swallowed Moses down to his extremities. Zipporah knew by this token that the thing had happened because her second son had not been circumcised, and she hastened to make good the omission. As soon as she sprinkled the blood of the circumcision on her husband's feet, a heavenly voice was heard to cry to the serpent, commanding him, \"Spew him out!\" and Moses came forth and stood upon his feet. Thus Zipporah saved Moses' life twice, first from the pit and then from the serpent. When Moses arrived in Egypt, he was approached by Dathan and Abiram, the leaders of the Israelites, and they spake: \"Comest thou hither to slay us, or dost thou purpose to do the same with us as thou didst with the Egyptian?\" This drove Moses straightway back to Midian, and there he remained two years more, until God revealed Himself at Horeb, and said to him, \"Go and bring forth My children out of the land of Egypt.",

      "content": "The latter years of Israel's bondage in Egypt were the worst. To punish Pharaoh for his cruelty toward the children of Israel, God afflicted him with a plague of leprosy, which covered his whole body, from the crown of his bead to the soles of his feet. Instead of being chastened by his disease, Pharaoh remained stiffnecked, and he tried to restore his health by murdering Israelitish children. He took counsel with his three advisers, Balaam, Jethro, and Job, how he might be healed of the awful malady that had seized upon him. Balaam spoke, saying, \"Thou canst regain thy health only if thou wilt slaughter Israelitish children and bathe in their blood.\" Jethro, averse from having a share in such an atrocity, left the king and fled to Midian. Job, on the other hand, though he also disapproved of Balaam's counsel, kept silence, and in no wise protested against it, wherefor God punished him with a year's suffering. But afterward He loaded him down with all the felicities of this life, and granted him many years, so that this pious Gentile might be rewarded in this world for his good deeds and not have the right to urge a claim upon the beatitude of the future life. In pursuance of the sanguinary advice given by Balaam, Pharaoh had his bailiffs snatch Israelitish babes from their mothers' breasts, and slaughter them, and in the blood of these innocents he bathed. His disease afflicted him for ten years, and every day an Israelitish child was killed for him. It was all in vain; indeed, at the end of the time his leprosy changed into boils, and he suffered more than before. While he was in this agony, the report was brought to him that the children of Israel in Goshen were careless and idle in their forced labor. The news aggravated his suffering, and he said: \"Now that I am ill, they turn and scoff at me. Harness my chariot, and I will betake myself to Goshen, and see the derision wherewith the children of Israel deride me.\" And they took and put him upon a horse, for he was not able to mount it himself. When he and his men had come to the border between Egypt and Goshen, the king's steed passed into a narrow place. The other horses, running rapidly through the pass, pressed upon each other until the king's horse fell while he sate upon it, and when it fell, the chariot turned over on his face, and also the horse lay upon him. The king's flesh was torn from him, for this thing was from the Lord, He had heard the cries of His people and their affliction. The king's servants carried him upon their shoulders, brought him back to Egypt, and placed him on his bed. He knew that his end was come to die, and the queen Alfar'anit and his nobles gathered about his bed, and they wept a great weeping with him. The princes and his counsellors advised the king to make choice of a successor, to reign in his stead, whomsoever he would choose from among his sons. He had three sons and two daughters by the queen Alfar'anit, beside children from concubines. The name of his first-born was Atro, the name of the second Adikam, and of the third Moryon. The name of the older daughter was Bithiah, and of the other, Akuzit. The first-born of the sons of the king was an idiot, precipitate and heedless in all his actions. Adikam, the second son, was a cunning and clever man, and versed in all the wisdom of Egypt, but ungainly in appearance, fleshy and short of stature; his height was a cubit and a space, and his beard flowed down to his ankles. The king resolved that Adikam should reign in his stead after his death. When this second son of his was but ten years old, he had given him Gedidah, the daughter of Abilat, to wife, and she bore him four sons. Afterward Adikam went and took three other wives, and begot eight sons and three daughters. The king's malady increased upon him greatly, and his flesh emitted a stench like a carcass cast into the field in summer time in the heat of the sun. When he saw that his disorder bad seized upon him with a strong grip, he commanded his son Adikam to be brought to him, and they made him king over the land in his place. At the end of three years the old king died in shame and disgrace, a loathing to all that saw him, and they buried him in the sepulchre of the kings of Egypt in Zoan, but they did not embalm him, as was usual with kings, for his flesh was putrid, and they could not approach his body on account of the stench, and they buried him in haste. Thus the Lord requited him with evil for the evil he had done in his days to Israel, and he died in terror and shame after having reigned ninety-four years. Adikam was twenty years old when he succeeded his father, and he reigned four years. The people of Egypt called him Pharaoh, as was their custom with all their kings, but his wise men called him Akuz, for Akuz is the word for \"short\" in the Egyptian language, and Adikam was exceedingly awkward and undersized. The new Pharaoh surpassed his father Malol and all the former kings in wickedness, and he made heavier the yoke upon the children of Israel. He went to Goshen with his servants, and increased their labor, and he said unto them, \"Complete your work, each day's task, and let not your hands slacken from the work from this day forward, as you did in the day of my father.\" He placed officers over them from amongst the children of Israel, and over these officers he placed taskmasters from amongst his servants. And he put before them a measure for bricks, according to the number they were to make day by day, and whenever any deficiency was discovered in the measure of their daily bricks, the taskmasters of Pharaoh would go to the women of the children of Israel, and take their infants from them, as many as the number of bricks lacking in the measure, and these babes they put into the building instead of the missing bricks. The taskmasters forced each man of the Israelites to put his own child in the building. The father would place his son in the wall, and cover him over with mortar, all the while weeping, his tears running down upon his child. The children of Israel sighed every day on account of their dire suffering, for they had thought that after Pharaoh's death his son would lighten their toil, but the new king was worse than his father. And God saw the burden of the children of Israel, and their heavy work, and He determined to deliver them. However, it was not for their own sake that God resolved upon the deliverance of the children of Israel, for they were empty of good deeds, and the Lord foreknew that, once they were redeemed, they would rise up against Him, and even worship the golden calf. Yet He took mercy upon them, for He remembered His covenant with the Fathers, and He looked upon their repentance for their sins, and accepted their promise, to fulfil the word of God after their going forth from Egypt even before they should hear it. After all, the children of Israel were not wholly without merits. In a high degree they possessed qualities of extraordinary excellence. There were no incestuous relations among them, they were not evil-tongued, they did not change their names, they clung to the Hebrew language, never giving it up, and great fraternal affection prevailed among them. If one happened to finish the tale of his bricks before his neighbors, he was in the habit of helping the others. Therefore God spake, \"They deserve that I should have mercy upon them, for if a man shows mercy unto another, I have mercy upon him.\"",

      "content": "When Jethro bestowed his daughter Zipporah upon Moses as his wife, he said to his future son-in-law: \"I know that thy father Jacob took his wives, the daughters of Laban, and went away with them against their father's will. Now take an oath that thou wilt not do the same unto me,\" and Moses swore not to leave him without his consent, and he remained with Jethro, who made him the shepherd of his flocks. By the way he tended the sheep, God saw his fitness to be the shepherd of His people, for God never gives an exalted office to a man until He has tested him in little things. Thus Moses and David were tried as shepherds of flocks, and only after they had proved their ability as such, He gave them dominion over men. Moses watched over the flocks with loving care. He led the young animals to pasture first, that they might have the tender, juicy grass for their food; the somewhat older animals he led forth next, and allowed them to graze off the herbs suitable for them; and finally came the vigorous ones that had attained their full growth, and to them he gave the hard grass that was left, which the others could not eat, but which afforded good food for them. Then spake God, \"He that understandeth how to pasture sheep, providing for each what is good for it, he shall pasture My people.\" Once a kid escaped from the flock, and when Moses followed it, he saw how it stopped at all the water courses, and he said to it: \"Poor kid, I knew not that thou wast thirsty, and wast running after water! Thou art weary, I ween,\" and he carried it back to the herd on his shoulder. Then said God: \"Thou hast compassion with a flock belonging to a man of flesh and blood! As thou livest, thou shalt pasture Israel, My flock.\" Not only did Moses take heed that no harm should come to the herds under his charge, but he was also careful that they cause no injury to men. He always chose an open meadow as his pasturing place, to prevent his sheep from grazing in private estates. Jethro had no reason to be dissatisfied with the services rendered to him by his son-in-law. During the forty years Moses acted as his shepherd not one sheep was attacked by wild beasts, and the herds multiplied to an incredible degree. Once he drove the sheep about in the desert for forty days, without finding a pasturing place for them. Nevertheless he did not lose a single sheep. Moses' longing for the desert was irresistible. His prophetic spirit caused him to foresee that his own greatness and the greatness of Israel would manifest themselves there. In the desert God's wonders would appear, though it would be at the same time the grave of the human herd to be entrusted to him in the future, and also his own last restingplace. Thus he had a presentiment at the very beginning of his career that the desert would be the scene of his activity, which not only came true in the present order of things, but also will be true in the latter days, when he will appear in the desert again, to lead into the promised land the generation, arisen from their graves, that he brought forth from Egyptian bondage. Wandering through the desert, he reached Mount Horeb, which is called by six names, each conveying one of its distinctions. It is \"the mountain of God,\" wherein the Lord revealed His law; \"Basban,\" for God \"came there\"; \"a mountain of humps,\" for the Lord declared all the other mountains unfit for the revelation, as \"crookbackt\" animals are declared unfit for sacrifices; \"mountain of abode,\" because it is the mountain that God desired for His \"abode\"; Sinai, because the \"hatred\" of God against the heathen began at the time when Israel received the law thereon; and Horeb, \"sword,\" because there the sword of the law was drawn upon the sinners.",

      "content": "When Moses drew near to Mount Horeb, he was aware at once that it was a holy place, for he noticed that passing birds did not alight upon it. At his approach the mountain began to move, as though to go forward and meet him, and it settled back into quietude only when his foot rested upon it. The first thing Moses noticed was the wonderful burning bush, the upper part of which was a blazing flame, neither consuming the bush, nor preventing it from bearing blossoms as it burnt, for the celestial fire has three peculiar qualities: it produces blossoms, it does not consume the object around which it plays, and it is black of color. The fire that Moses saw in the bush was the appearance of the angel Michael, who had descended as the forerunner of the Shekinah herself to come down presently. It was the wish of God to hold converse with Moses, who, however, was not inclined to permit any interruption of the work under his charge. Therefore God startled him with the wonderful phenomenon of the burning thorn-bush. That brought Moses to a stop, and then God spoke with him. There were good reasons for selecting the thorn-bush as the vessel for a Divine vision. It was \"clean,\" for the heathen could not use it to make idols. God's choosing to dwell in the stunted thorn-bush conveyed the knowledge to Moses that He suffers along with Israel. Furthermore, Moses was taught that there is nothing in nature, not even the insignificant thorn-bush, that can exist without the presence of the Shekinah. Besides, the thorn-bush may be taken as the symbol for Israel in several respects. As the thornbush is the lowliest of all species of trees, so the condition of Israel in the exile is the lowliest as compared with that of all the other nations, but as the thorn-bush releases no bird that alights upon it without lacerating its wings, so the nations that subjugate Israel will be punished. Also, as a garden hedge is made of the thorn-bush, so Israel forms the hedge for the world, the garden of God, for without Israel the world could not endure. Furthermore, as the thornbush bears thorns and roses alike, so Israel has pious and impious members, and as the thorn-bush requires ample water for its growth, so Israel can prosper only through the Torah, the celestial water. And the thorn-bush, the leaf of which consists of five leaflets, was to indicate to Moses that God had resolved to redeem Israel only for the sake of the merits of five pious men, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Aaron, and Moses. The numbers represented by the letters composing the Hebrew word for thorn-bush, Seneh, add up to one hundred and twenty, to convey that Moses would reach the age of one hundred and twenty years, and that the Shekinah would rest on Mount Horeb for one hundred and twenty days. Finally, in order to give Moses an illustration of His modesty, God descended from the exalted heavens and spake to him from a lowly thorn-bush instead of the summit of a lofty mountain or the top of a stately cedar tree.",

      "content": "The vision of the burning bush appeared to Moses alone; the other shepherds with him saw nothing of it. He took five steps in the direction of the bush, to view it at close range, and when God beheld the countenance of Moses distorted by grief and anxiety over Israel's suffering, He spake, \"This one is worthy of the office of pasturing My people.\" Moses was still a novice in prophecy, therefore God said to Himself, \"If I reveal Myself to him in loud tones, I shall alarm him, but if I reveal Myself with a subdued voice, he will hold prophecy in low esteem,\" whereupon he addressed him in his father Amram's voice. Moses was overjoyed to hear his father speak, for it gave him the assurance that. he was still alive. The voice called his name twice, and he answered, \"Here am I! What is my father's wish?\" God replied, saying, \"I am not thy father. I but desired to refrain from terrifying thee, therefore I spoke with thy father's voice. I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\" These words rejoiced Moses greatly, for not only was his father Amram's name pronounced in the same breath with the names of the three Patriarchs, but it came before theirs, as though he ranked higher than they. Moses said not a word. In silent reverence before the Divine vision he covered his face, and when God disclosed the mission with which He charged him, of bringing the Israelites forth from the land of Egypt, he answered with humility, \"Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?\" Thereupon spake God, \"Moses, thou art meek, and I will reward thee for thy modesty. I will deliver the whole land of Egypt into thine hand, and, besides, I will let thee ascend unto the throne of My glory, and look upon all the angels of the heavens.\" Hereupon God commanded Metatron, the Angel of the Face, to conduct Moses to the celestial regions amid the sound of music and song, and He commanded him furthermore to summon thirty thousand angels, to serve as his body-guard, fifteen thousand to right of him and fifteen thousand to left of him. In abject terror Moses asked Metatron, \"Who art thou?\" and the angel replied, \"I am Enoch, the son of Jared, thy ancestor, and God has charged me to accompany thee to His throne.\" But Moses demurred, saying, \"I am but flesh and blood, and I cannot look upon the countenance of an angel,\" whereupon Metatron changed Moses' flesh into torches of fire, his eyes into Merkabah wheels, his strength into an angel's, and his tongue into a flame, and he took him to heaven with a retinue of thirty thousand angels, one half moving to right of them and one half to left of them. In the first heaven Moses saw streams upon streams of water, and he observed that the whole heaven consisted of windows, at each of which angels were stationed. Metatron named and pointed out all the windows of heaven to him: the window of prayer and the window of supplication; of weeping and of joy; plenitude and starvation; wealth and poverty; war and peace; conception and birth; showers and soft rains; sin and repentance; life and death; pestilence and healing; sickness and health; and many windows more. In the second heaven Moses saw the angel Nuriel, standing three hundred parasangs high, with his retinue of fifty myriads of angels, all fashioned out of water and fire, and all keeping their faces turned toward the Shekinah while they sang a song of praise to God. Metatron explained to Moses, that these were the angels set over the clouds, the winds, and the rains, who return speedily, as soon as they have executed the will of their Creator, to their station in the second of the heavens, there to proclaim the praise of God. In the third heaven Moses saw an angel, so tall it would take a human being five hundred years to climb to his height. He had seventy thousand heads, each head having as many mouths, each mouth as many tongues, and each tongue as many sayings, and he together with his suite of seventy thousand myriads of angels made of white fire praised and extolled the Lord. \"These,\" said Metatron to Moses, \"are called Erelim, and they are appointed over the grass, the trees, the fruits, and the grain, but as soon as they have done the will of their Creator, they return to the place assigned to them, and praise God.\" In the fourth heaven Moses saw a Temple, the pillars thereof made of red fire, the staves of green fire, the thresholds of white fire, the boards and clasps of flaming fire, the gates of carbuncles, and the pinnacles of rubies. Angels were entering the Temple and giving praise to God there. In response to a question from Moses Metatron told him that they presided over the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the other celestial bodies. and all of them intone songs before God. In this heaven Moses noticed also the two great planets, Venus and Mars, each as large as the whole earth, and concerning these he asked unto what purpose they had been created. Metatron explained thereupon, that Venus lies upon the sun to cool him off in summer, else he would scorch the earth, and Mars lies upon the moon, to impart warmth to her, lest she freeze the earth. Arrived in the fifth heaven, Moses saw hosts of angels, whose nether parts were of snow and their upper parts of fire, and yet the snow did not melt nor was the fire extinguished, for God had established perfect harmony between the two elements. These angels, called Ishim, have had nothing to do since the day of their creation but praise and extol the Lord. In the sixth of the heavens were millions and myriads of angels praising God, they were called 'Irin and kadishim, \"Watchers\" and \"Holy Ones,\" and their chief was made of hail, and he was so tall, it would take five hundred years to walk a distance equal to his height. In the last heaven Moses saw two angels, each five hundred parasangs in height, forged out of chains of black fire and red fire, the angels Af, \"Anger,\" and Hemah, \"Wrath,\" whom God created at the beginning of the world, to execute His will. Moses was disquieted when he looked upon them, but Metatron embraced him, and said, \"Moses, Moses, thou favorite of God, fear not, and be not terrified,\" and Moses became calm. There was another angel in the seventh heaven, different in appearance from all the others, and of frightful mien. His height was so great, it would have taken five hundred years to cover a distance equal to it, and from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet he was studded with glaring eyes, at the sight of which the beholder fell prostrate in awe. \"This one,\" said Metatron, addressing Moses, \"is Samael, who takes the soul away from man.\" \"Whither goes he now?\" asked Moses, and Metatron replied, \"To fetch the soul of Job the pious.\" Thereupon Moses prayed to God in these words, \"O may it be Thy will, my God and the God of my fathers, not to let me fall into the hands of this angel.\" Here, in the highest heaven, he saw also the seraphim with their six wings. With two they cover their face, that they gaze not upon the Shekinah; and with two their feet, which, being like a calf's feet, they hide, to keep secret Israel's transgression of the golden calf. With the third pair of wings they fly and do the service of the Lord, all the while exclaiming, \"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory.\" The wings of these angels are of prodigious size, it would take a man five hundred years to traverse their length and their breadth, as from one end of the earth to the other. And Moses saw in the seventh heaven the holy Hayyot, which support the throne of God; and he beheld also the angel Zagzagel, the prince of the Torah and of wisdom, who teaches the Torah in seventy languages to the souls of men, and thereafter they cherish the precepts contained therein as laws revealed by God to Moses on Sinai. From this angel with the horns of glory Moses himself learnt all the ten mysteries.\" Having seen what there is in the seven heavens, he spoke to God, saying, \"I will not leave the heavens unless Thou grantest me a gift,\" and God replied, \"I will give thee the Torah, and men shall call it the Law of Moses.\"",

      "content": "When Moses was on the point of departing from heaven, a celestial voice announced: \"Moses, thou camest hither, and thou didst see the throne of My glory. Now thou shalt see also Paradise and hell,\" and God dispatched Gabriel on the errand of showing hell to him. Terrified by its fires, when he caught sight of them as he entered the portals of hell, Moses refused to go farther. But the angel encouraged him, saying, \"There is a fire that not only burns but also consumes, and that fire will protect thee against hell fire, so that thou canst step upon it, and yet thou wilt not be seared.\" As Moses entered hell, the fire withdrew a distance of five hundred parasangs, and the Angel of Hell, Nasargiel, asked him, \"Who art thou?\" and he answered, \"I am Moses, the son of Amram.\" Nasargiel: \"This is not thy place, thou belongest in Paradise.\" Moses: \"I came hither to see the manifestation of the power of God.\" Then said God to the Angel of Hell, \"Go and show hell unto Moses, and how the wicked are treated there.\" Immediately he went with Moses, walking before him like a pupil before his master, and thus they entered hell together, and Moses saw men undergoing torture by the Angels of Destruction: some of the sinners were suspended by their eyelids, some by their ears, some by their hands, and some by their tongues, and they cried bitterly. And women were suspended by their hair and by their breasts, and in other ways, all on chains of fire. Nasargiel explained: \"These hang by their eyes, because they looked lustfully upon the wives of their neighbors, and with a covetous eye upon the possessions of their fellow-men. These hang by their ears because they listened to empty and vain speech, and turned their ear away from hearing the Torah. These hang by their tongues, because they talked slander, and accustomed their tongue to foolish babbling. These hang by their feet, because they walked with them in order to spy upon their fellow-men, but they walked not to the synagogue, to offer prayer unto their Creator. These hang by their hands, because with them they robbed their neighbors of their possessions, and committed murder. These women hang by their hair and their breasts, because they uncovered them in the presence of young men, so that they conceived desire unto them, and fell into sin.\" Moses heard hell cry with a loud and a bitter cry, saying to Nasargiel: \"Give me something to eat, I am hungry.\"— Nasargiel: \"What shall I give thee?\"—Hell: \"Give me the souls of the pious.\"—Nasargiel: \"The Holy One, blessed be He, will not deliver the souls of the pious unto thee.\" Moses saw the place called Alukah, where sinners were suspended by their feet, their heads downward, and their bodies covered with black worms, each five hundred parasangs long. They lamented, and cried: \"Woe unto us for the punishment of hell. Give us death, that we may die!\" Nasargiel explained: \"These are the sinners that swore falsely, profaned the Sabbath and the holy days, despised the sages, called their neighbors by unseemly nicknames, wronged the orphan and the widow, and bore false witness. Therefore bath God delivered them to these worms.\" Moses went thence to another place, and there he saw sinners prone on their faces, with two thousand scorpions lashing, stinging, and tormenting them, while the tortured victims cried bitterly. Each of the scorpions had seventy thousand heads, each head seventy thousand mouths, each mouth seventy thousand stings, and each sting seventy thousand pouches of poison and venom, which the sinners are forced to drink down, although the anguish is so racking that their eyes melt in their sockets. Nasargiel explained: \"These are the sinners who caused the Israelites to lose their money, who exalted themselves above the community, who put their neighbors to shame in public, who delivered their fellow-Israelites into the hands of the Gentiles, who denied the Torah of Moses, and who maintained that God is not the Creator of the world.\" Then Moses saw the place called Tit ba-Yawen, in which the sinners stand in mud up to their navels, while the Angels of Destruction lash them with fiery chains, and break their teeth with fiery stones, from morning until evening, and during the night they make their teeth grow again, to the length of a parasang, only to break them anew the next morning. Nasargiel explained: \"These are the sinners who ate carrion and forbidden flesh, who lent their money at usury, who wrote the Name of God on amulets for Gentiles, who used false weights, who stole money from their fellow-Israelites, who ate on the Day of Atonement, who ate forbidden fat, and animals and reptiles that are an abomination, and who drank blood.\" Then Nasargiel said to Moses: \"Come and see how the sinners are burnt in hell,\" and Moses answered, \"I cannot go there,\" but Nasargiel replied, \"Let the light of the Shekinah precede thee, and the fire of hell will have no power over thee.\" Moses yielded, and he saw how the sinners were burnt, one half of their bodies being immersed in fire and the other half in snow, while worms bred in their own flesh crawled over them, and the Angels of Destruction beat them incessantly. Nasargiel explained: \"These are the sinners who committed incest, murder, and idolatry, who cursed their parents and their teachers, and who, like Nimrod and others, called themselves gods.\" In this place, which is called Abaddon, he saw the sinners taking snow by stealth and putting it in their armpits, to relieve the pain inflicted by the scorching fire, and he was convinced that the saying was true, \"The wicked mend not their ways even at the gate of hell.\" As Moses departed from hell, he prayed to God, \"May it be Thy will, O Lord my God and God of my fathers, to save me and the people of Israel from the places I have seen in hell.\" But God answered him, and said, \"Moses, before Me there is no respecting of persons and no taking of gifts. Whoever doeth good deeds entereth Paradise, and he that doeth evil must go to hell.\" At the command of God, Gabriel now led Moses to Paradise. As he entered, two angels came toward him, and they said to him, \"Thy time is not yet arrived to leave the world,\" and Moses made answer, \"What ye say is true, but I have come to see the reward of the pious in Paradise.\" Then the angels extolled Moses, saying: \"Hail, Moses, servant of God! Hail, Moses, born of woman, that hast been found worthy to ascend to the seven heavens! Hail to the nation to which thou belongest!\" Under the tree of life Moses saw the angel Shamshiel, the prince of Paradise, who led him through it, and showed him all there is therein. He saw seventy thrones made of precious stones, standing on feet of fine gold, each throne surrounded by seventy angels. But one of them was larger than all the others, and it was encircled by one hundred and twenty angels. This was the throne of Abraham, and when Abraham beheld Moses, and heard who he was, and what his purpose was in visiting Paradise, he exclaimed, \"Praise ye the Lord, for He is good, for His mercy endureth forever.\" Moses asked Shamshiel about the size of Paradise, but not even he who is the prince thereof could answer the question, for there is none that can gauge it. It can neither be measured nor fathomed nor numbered. But Shamshiel explained to Moses about the thrones, that they were different one from the other, some being of silver, some of gold, some of precious stones and pearls and rubies and carbuncles. The thrones made of pearls are for the scholars that study the Torah day and night for her own sake; those of precious stones are for the pious, those of rubies for the just, those of gold for the repentant sinners, and those of silver for the righteous proselytes. \"The greatest of them all,\" continued Shamshiel, \"is the throne of Abraham, the next in size the thrones of Isaac and Jacob, then come the thrones of the prophets, the saints, and the righteous, each in accordance with a man's worth, and his rank, and the good deeds he has performed in his lifetime.\" Moses asked then for whom the throne of copper was intended, and the angel answered, \"For the sinner that has a pious son. Through the merits of his son he receives it as his share.\" Again Moses looked, and he beheld a spring of living water welling up from under the tree of life and dividing into four streams, which passed under the throne of glory, and thence encompassed Paradise from end to end. He also saw four rivers flowing under each of the thrones of the pious, one of honey, the second of milk, the third of wine, and the fourth of pure balsam. Beholding all these desirable and pleasant things, Moses felt great joy, and he said, \"Oh, how great is Thy goodness, which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee, which Thou hast wrought for them that put their trust in Thee, before the sons of men!\" And Moses left Paradise, and returned to the earth. At the moment of his departure, a heavenly voice cried aloud: \"Moses, servant of the Lord, thou that art faithful in His house, even as thou hast seen the reward that is laid up for the pious in the world to come, so also thou wilt be worthy of seeing the life of the world that shall be in the future time. Thou and all Israel, ye shall see the rebuilding of the Temple and the advent of the Messiah, behold the beauty of the Lord, and meditate in His Temple.\" In the world to come Moses, beside sharing the joys of Israel, will continue his activity as the teacher of Israel, for the people will go before Abraham and request him to instruct them in the Torah. He will send them to Isaac, saying, \"Go to Isaac, he hath studied more of the Torah than ever I studied,\" but Isaac, in turn, will send them to Jacob, saying, \"Go to Jacob, he hath had more converse with the sages than ever I had.\" And Jacob will send them to Moses, saying, \"Go to Moses, he was instructed in the Torah by God Himself.\" In the Messianic time, Moses will be one of the seven shepherds that shall be the leaders of Israel with the Messiah.",

      "content": "When Moses turned aside to see the great sight, that the bush was not consumed, he heard a voice calling to him, \"Draw not nigh hither.\" These words were to convey that the dignity to be conferred upon him God intended for Moses personally, not for his descendants, and further he was warned not to arrogate honors appointed for others, as the priesthood, which was to belong to Aaron and Aaron's descendants, or royalty, which was to appertain to David and the house of David. Again the voice spake: \"Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.\" These words conveyed the desire of God that he cut asunder every bond uniting him with earthly concerns, he was even to give up his conjugal life. Hereupon the angel Michael spoke to God: \"O Lord of the world, can it be Thy purpose to destroy mankind? Blessing can prevail only if male and female are united, and yet Thou biddest Moses separate from his wife.\" God answered, saying, \"Moses has begot children, he has done his duty toward the world. I desire him to unite himself now with the Shekinah, that she may descend upon earth for his sake.\" God spake furthermore, addressing Moses, \"Thou seest only what is to happen in the near future, that Israel is to receive the Torah on Mount Sinai, but I behold what cometh after, bow the people will worship the steer, the figure of which they will see upon My chariot, even while My revelation will be made on Sinai. Thus they will excite My wrath. Nevertheless, though I know all the perverseness of their hearts, wherein they will rebel against Me in the desert, I will redeem them now, for I accord unto man the treatment he merits for his present actions, not what he will deserve in the future. I promised their father Jacob, 'I will go down with thee into Egypt, and I will also surely bring thee up again,' and now I will betake myself thither, to bring Israel up in accordance with My words unto Jacob, and bear them to the land I swore unto their fathers, that their seed should inherit it. So long as the time of affliction that I had appointed unto his seed in My revelation to Abraham was not past, I hearkened not to the supplication and the groaning of his children, but now the end hath come. Therefore, go before Pharaoh, that he dismiss My people. If thou dost not bring about the redemption, none other will, for there is none other that can do it. In thee doth Israel hope, and upon thee doth Israel wait. The matter lieth in thine hands alone.\" Moses, however, refused to take the mission upon himself. He said to God, \"Thy promise unto Jacob was, 'I will surely bring thee up again out of Egypt.' Thou didst undertake to do it Thyself, and now it is Thy purpose to send me thither. And how, indeed, were it possible for me to accomplish this great matter, to bring the children of Israel up out of Egypt? How could I provide them with food and drink? Many are the women in childbirth among them, many are the pregnant women and the little children. Whence shall I procure dainties for those who have borne babes, whence sweetmeats for the pregnant, and whence tidbits for the little ones? And how may I venture to go among the Egyptian brigands and murderers? for Thou art bidding me to go to mine enemies, to those who lie in wait to take my life. Why should I risk the safety of my person, seeing that I know not whether Israel possesses merits making them worthy of redemption?' I have reckoned up the years with care, and I have found that but two hundred and ten have elapsed since the covenant of the pieces made with Abraham, and at that time Thou didst ordain four hundred years of oppression for his seed.\" But God overturned all his objections. He spake to Moses, saying: \"I will be with thee. Whatever thou desirest I will do, so that the redemption will in very truth be realized through Me, in accordance with My promise to Jacob. The little ones that Israel will carry up out of Egypt I will provide with food for thirty days. This shall prove to thee in what manner I will supply the needs of all. And as I will be at thy side, thou hast no need to fear any man. Respecting thy doubt, whether Israel deserves to be redeemed, this is My answer: they will be permitted to go forth from Egypt on account of the merits they will acquire at this mountain, whereon they will receive the Torah through thee. And thy reckoning of the end is not correct, for the four hundred years of bondage began with the birth of Isaac, not with the going down of Jacob into Egypt. Therefore the appointed end hath come.\" Persuaded now of God's unalterable resolve to use him as His instrument in the redemption of Israel from Egypt, Moses entreated God to impart to him the knowledge of His Great Name, that he be not confounded if the children of Israel ask for it. God answered, saying: \"Thou desirest to know My Name? My Name is according to My acts. When I judge My creatures, I am called Elohim, \"judge\"; when I rise up to do battle against the sinners, I am Lord Zebaot, \"the Lord of hosts\"; when I wait with longsuffering patience for the improvement of the sinner, My name is El Shaddai; when I have mercy upon the world, I am Adonai. But unto the children of Israel shalt thou say that I am He that was, that is, and that ever will be, and I am He that is with them in their bondage now, and He that shall be with them in the bondage of the time to come.\" In reply to the latter words of God, Moses said, \"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,\" and God assented thereto. He admitted that it was not proper to force the knowledge of future suffering upon Israel in a present that was itself full of evil and sorrow. And the Lord said to Moses: \"My words about the future were meant for thee alone, not also for them. Tell the children of Israel, besides, that at My behest an angel can stretch his hand from heaven and touch the earth with it, and three angels can find room under one tree, and My majesty can fill the whole world, for when it was My will, it appeared to Job in his hair, and, again, when I willed otherwise, it appeared in a thorn-bush.\" But the most important communication from God to Moses concerning the Divine Names were the words to follow: \"In mercy I created the world; in mercy I guide it; and with mercies I will return to Jerusalem. But unto the children of Israel thou shalt say that My mercy upon them is for the sake of the merits of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\" When Moses heard these words, he spoke to God, saying, \"Are there men that transgress after death?\" and when God assured him that it was not possible for the dead to sin, Moses asked again, \"Why, then, is it that Thou didst reveal Thyself to me at the first as the God of my father, and now Thou passest him over?\" Whereupon God said, \"In the beginning it was My purpose to address thee with flattering words, but now thou hearest the whole and exact truth, I am only the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\" Moses prayed to God, entreating Him to reveal His Great and Holy Name unto him, so that he might call upon Him with it and secure the fulfilment of all his wishes. The Lord granted the prayer of Moses, and when the celestials knew that He had revealed the secret of the Ineffable Name, they cried out, \"Blessed art Thou, O Lord, gracious Giver of knowledge!\" God is always regardful of the honor of the elders of a people, and He bade Moses assemble those of Israel and announce the approaching redemption to them. And as God knew beforehand how Pharaoh's obduracy would display itself, He made it known to Moses at once, lest he reproach God later with the Egyptian king's frowardness.",

      "title": "Moses Punished For His Stubbornness",
      "content": "In spite of all these safeguards, Moses was not yet ready to accept the mission God wished to impose upon him. He persisted in urging his fears, saying: \"But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice, for they will say, 'The Lord hath not appeared unto thee.[] And the Lord said unto him, \"What is that in thine hand?\" And he said, \"A rod.\" And the Lord said: \"Thou deservest to be castigated with it. If thou didst not intend to take My mission upon thyself, thou shouldst have said so in the beginning. Instead, thou didst hold back with thy refusal, until I revealed to thee the great secret of the Ineffable Name, that thou mightest know it if the children of Israel should ask thee concerning it. And now thou sayest, I will not go. Now, therefore, if thou wilt not execute My charge to thee, it will be executed by this rod. It was My wish to distinguish thee and make thee My instrument for doing many miracles. But thou deservest a punishment for having suspected My children of lack of faith. The children of Israel are believers and sons of believers, but thou wilt show thyself of little faith in thy career, and as thou followest the example of the slanderous serpent, so shalt thou be punished with leprosy, wherewith the serpent was punished.\" The Lord now bade Moses put his hand into his bosom and take it out again, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow. And God bade him put his hand into his bosom again, and it turned again as his other flesh. Beside being a chastisement for his hasty words, the plague on his hand was to teach him that as the leper defiles, so the Egyptians defiled Israel, and as Moses was healed of his uncleanness, so God would cleanse the children of Israel of the pollution the Egyptians had brought upon them. The second wonder connected with the rod of Moses likewise conveyed a double meaning, in that it pointed to the coming redemption of Israel, and taught Moses a specific lesson. At the bidding of God, Moses cast his rod on the ground, and it became a serpent, to show him that when he traduced Israel, he was following the example of the abusive serpent, and also to show him that the great dragon that lieth in the midst of the rivers of Egypt, though he was now hacking into Israel with his teeth, would be rendered harmless like the rod of wood, which has no power to bite. And, again, through the third miracle he was bidden to perform, God conveyed to Moses what would happen in the latter years of his own life. The sign He gave him was to make known to him that, before the water came, blood would flow from the rock at Meribah, when Moses should strike it after uttering the hasty, impatient words that were destined to bring death down upon him. For seven days God urged Moses to undertake the mission He desired him to execute. He resorted to persuasion, that the heathen might not say, that He abused His power as the Ruler of the world, forcing men to do His service against their will. But Moses remained obdurate, he could not be won over. He said: \"Thou doest a wrong unto me in sending me to Pharaoh. In the palace of the Egyptian king there are persons that know how to speak the seventy languages of the world. No matter what language a man may use, there is someone that understands him. If I should come as Thy representative, and they should discover that I am not able to converse in the seventy languages, they will mock at me, and say, 'Behold this man, he pretends to be the ambassador of the Creator of the world, and he cannot speak the seventy languages.' \" To this God made reply, as follows: \"Adam, who was taught by none, could give names to the beasts in the seventy languages. Was it not I that made him to speak?\" Moses was not yet satisfied, he continued to urge objections, and he said: \"O Lord of the world, Thou wouldst charge me with the task of chastising Egypt and redeeming Israel, and I am ready to be Thy messenger. But is it seemly that a man should execute two errands at once? Nay, my Lord, for this two men are needed.\" God made answer, and said, \"Moses, I know well whom thou hast in mind with thy request, to be thy companion in the mission I assign to thee. Know, therefore, that the holy spirit hath already come upon thy brother Aaron, and even now he is awaiting thee on the way of Egypt, and when his eyes rest upon thee he will rejoice.\" Furthermore God spake to Moses, saying, \"When I appeared unto thee the first time, thou wast meek, and didst hide thy face, not to see the vision. Whence cometh now this effrontery of thine, that thou addressest Me as a servant his master? Thou speakest too many words by far. Perchance thou thinkest I have no messengers, hosts, seraphim, ofanim, ministering angels, and Merkabah wheels, to send to Egypt, to bring My children thence, that thou sayest, 'Send by the hand of him whom Thou wilt send.' In sooth, thou deservest severe chastisement. But what can I do, seeing that I am the Master of mercy? If thou escapest unpunished, thou owest it to thy father Amram, who rendered great services in behalf of the preservation of the Israelitish people in Egypt.\" But Moses replied: \"O Lord of the world, I a prophet and the son of a prophet obeyed Thy words only after much hesitation, and I cannot expect Pharaoh, a wicked man and the son of a wicked man, and the Egyptians, a disobedient people and the sons of a disobedient people, to give ear to my words. O Lord of the world, Thou dost send me to Egypt to redeem sixty myriads of Thy people from the oppression of the Egyptians. If it were a question of delivering a couple of hundred men, it were a sufficiently difficult enterprise. How much severer is the task of freeing sixty myriads from the dominion of Pharaoh! If Thou hadst called upon the Egyptians to give up their evil ways soon after they began to enslave Israel, they might have heeded Thy admonitions. But if I should go and speak to them now, after they have been ruling over Israel these two hundred and ten years, Pharaoh would say, 'If a slave has served his master for ten years, and no protest has made itself heard from any quarter, how can a man conceive the idea suddenly of having him set at liberty?' Verily, O Lord of the world, the task Thou puttest upon me is too heavy for my strength.\" Moses said furthermore: \"I am not an eloquent man, nor can I see of what avail words can be in this matter. Thou art sending me to one that is himself a slave, to Pharaoh of the tribe of Ham, and a slave will not be corrected by words. I consent to go on Thy errand only if Thou wilt invest me with the power of chastising Pharaoh with brute force.\" To these words spoken by Moses, God made reply: \"Let it not fret thee that thou art not an eloquent speaker. It is I that made the mouth of all that speak, and I that made men dumb. One I make to see, another I make blind; one I make to hear, another I make deaf. Had I willed it so, thou hadst been a man of ready speech. But I desired to show a wonder through thee. Whenever I will it, the words I cast into thy mouth shall come forth without hesitation. But what thou sayest about a slave, that he cannot be corrected by words, is true, and therefore I give thee My rod for Pharaoh's castigation.\" But Moses still stood his ground. He raised other objections. \"His grandchild,\" he said, \"is closer to a man than his nephew. Nevertheless when Lot was taken captive, Thou didst send angels to the aid of Abraham's nephew. But now, when the life of sixty myriads of Abraham's lineal descendants is at stake, Thou sendest me, and not the angels. When the Egyptian bondwoman Hagar was in distress, Thou didst dispatch five angels to stand by her, and to redeem sixty myriads of the children of Sarah Thou dost dispatch me. O Lord, send, I pray Thee, by the hand of him whom Thou wilt send in days to come.\" To this God answered, saying, \"I said not that I would send thee to Israel, but to Pharaoh, and that one whom thou madest mention of, I will send to Israel at the end of days—Elijah will appear to them before the great and terrible day.\" If Moses refused to do the errand of the Lord, there was a reason. God had revealed to him the treasures of the Torah, of wisdom, and of knowledge, and the whole world's future. Now he beheld in the inner chamber of God rows of scholars and judges interpreting the Torah in fortynine different ways as they sat in the court of hewn stones; and he saw, besides, Rabbi Akiba explaining the meaning of the crowns upon the letters. Then said Moses: \"I do not care to be God's messenger. Let Him rather send one of these great scholars.\" Then God ordered the Angel of Wisdom to carry Moses to a place of myriads of scholars, all interpreting the Torah, and all making use of the formula: This is a Halakah revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai. Now Moses recognized that even the greatest scholars of future generations would be dependent upon him, and then, at last, he was ready to execute the mission God desired to lay upon him. But Moses had to pay dear for having hesitated in the execution of the Divine bidding. God said to him: \"It was appointed that thou shouldst be priest, and Aaron should be the Levite. Because thou hast refused to execute My will, thou shalt be the Levite, and Aaron shall be priest,\"—a punishment that did not fall upon Moses personally, but only upon his descendants, all of whom are Levites. As for himself, he performed a priest's service in the Tabernacle. Moses had said to God, \"Thou hast been speaking to me now these many days, nevertheless I am still slow of speech and of a slow tongue.\" For this he received another punishment. God said to him: \"I might change thee into a new man, and heal thee of thy imperfect speech, but because thou hast uttered such words, I refrain from curing thee.\"",

      "title": "The Return To Egypt",
      "content": "When Moses finally gave in, and declared himself ready to go to Egypt as God's messenger, his acceptance was still conditional upon the promise of God to fulfil all his wishes, and God granted whatsoever he desired, except immortality and entering the Holy Land. God also allayed his fears regarding the danger that threatened him from his whilom enemies Dathan and Abiram, on account of whom he had had to flee from Egypt. He told him that they had sunk to the estate of poor and insignificant men, bereft of the power of doing him harm. Moses was loyal to the oath he had given his father-in-law Jethro, never to return to Egypt without securing his consent. His first concern therefore was to go back to Midian and obtain his permission, which Jethro gave freely. Then Moses could set out on his journey. He tarried only to take his wife and his children with him, which made his fatherin-law say, \"Those who are in Egypt are to leave it, and thou desirest to take more thither?\" Moses replied: \"Very soon the slaves held in bondage in Egypt will be redeemed, and they will go forth from the land, and gather at Mount Sinai, and hear the words, 'I am the Lord thy God,' and should my sons not be present there?\" Jethro acknowledged the justice of Moses' words, and he said to him, \"Go in peace, enter Egypt in peace, and leave the land in peace.\" At last Moses sallied forth upon his journey to Egypt, accompanied by his wife and his children. He was mounted upon the very ass that had borne Abraham to the Akedah on Mount Moriah, the ass upon which the Messiah will appear riding at the end of days. Even now, his journey begun, Moses was but half-hearted about his mission. He travelled leisurely, thinking: \"When I arrive in Egypt and announce to the children of Israel that the end of the term of Egyptian slavery has come, they will say, 'We know very well that our bondage must last four hundred years, and the end is not yet,' but if I were to put this objection before God, He would break out in wrath against me. It is best for me to consume as much time as possible on the way thither.\" God was ill pleased with Moses for this artifice, and He spake to him, saying, \"Joseph prophesied long ago that the oppression of Egypt would endure only two hundred and ten years.\" For his lack of faith Moses was punished while he was on the road to Egypt. The angels Af and Hemah appeared and swallowed his whole body down to his feet, and they gave him up only after Zipporah, nimble as a \"bird,\" circumcised her son Gershom, and touched the feet of her husband with the blood of the circumcision. The reason why their son had remained uncircumcised until then was that Jethro had made the condition, when he consented to the marriage of his daughter with Moses, that the first son of their union should be brought up as a Gentile. When Moses was released by the angels, he attacked them, and he slew Hemah, whose host of angels, however, held their own before the assailant. The Divine voice heard by Moses in Midian telling him to return to his brethren in Egypt fell at the same time upon the ear of Aaron, dwelling in Egypt, and it bade him \"go into the wilderness to meet Moses.\" God speaketh marvellously with His voice, and therefore the same revelation could be understood one way in Midian and another way in Egypt. The greeting of the two brothers was very cordial. Envy and jealousy bad no place between them. Aaron was rejoiced that God had chosen his younger brother to be the redeemer of Israel, and Moses was rejoiced that his older brother had been divinely appointed the high priest in Israel. God knew their hearts, for at the time when He charged him with the Egyptian mission, Moses had said, \"All these years Aaron has been active as a prophet in Israel, and should I now encroach upon his province and cause him vexation?\" But God reassured him, saying, \"Moses, thy brother Aaron will surely not be vexed, he will rather rejoice at thy mission, yea, he will come forth and meet thee.\" Aaron showed his joy freely at seeing his brother once more, after their separation of many years. As for his joy in the distinction accorded to Moses, it was too great to be expressed in all its depth and extent. For his kind, generous spirit, he received a reward from God, in that he was permitted to bear the Urim and Thummim upon his heart, \"for,\" God said, \"the heart that rejoiced at the exalting of a brother shall wear the Urim and Thummim.\" Aaron ran to meet his brother, and embraced him, and asked where he had spent all the years of their separation. When he was told in Midian, he continued to question him, saying, \"Who are these that are travelling with thee?\" Moses: \"My wife and my sons.\" Aaron: \"Whither goest thou with them?\" Moses: \"To Egypt.\" Aaron: \"What! Great enough is our sorrow through those who have been in Egypt from the beginning, and thou takest more to the land?\" Moses recognized that Aaron was right, and he sent his wife and his sons back to his father-in-law Jethro. He was no less magnanimous than Aaron. If the elder brother felt no envy on account of the younger brother's dignity, the younger brother did not withhold from the other the teachings and revelations he had received. Immediately after meeting with Aaron, Moses told him all that God had taught him, even the awful secret of the Ineffable Name communicated to him on Mount Horeb. In obedience to the command of God, the elders of the people were assembled, and before them Moses performed the wonders that were to be his credentials as the redeemer sent to deliver the people. Nevertheless, the deeds he did were not so potent in convincing them of the reality of the mission as the words wherein God had announced the approaching redemption to him, which he repeated in their ears. The elders knew that Jacob had imparted to Joseph the secret mark designating the redeemer, and Joseph had in turn confided it to his brethren before his death. The last surviving one of the brethren, Asher, had revealed it to his daughter Serah, in the following words: \"He that will come and proclaim the redemption with the words of God, 'I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt,' he is the true redeemer.\" Serah was still alive at Moses' return, and the elders betook themselves to her, and told her the words of Moses announcing the redemption. When she heard that his words had been the same as those Asher had quoted, she knew that he was the promised redeemer, and all the people believed in him. Thereupon Moses invited the elders to go to Pharaoh with him, but they lacked the courage to appear before the king. Though they started out with Moses, they dropped off stealthily on the way, one by one, and when Moses and Aaron stood in the presence of the king, they found themselves alone, deserted by all the others. The elders did not go out free. Their punishment was that God did not permit them to ascend the holy mountain with Moses. They durst accompany him on the way to God only as far as they had accompanied him on the way to Pharaoh, and then they had to tarry until he came again.",

Pharaoh's palace was surrounded by a vast army. It was built with four hundred entrances, one hundred on each side, and each of them guarded by sixty thousand soldiers. Moses and Aaron were overawed by this display of power, and they were afraid. But the angel Gabriel appeared, and he led them into the palace, observed by none of the guards, and Pharaoh decreed severe punishment upon the inattentive sentinels for having admitted the old men without his permission. They were dismissed, and others put in their places. But the same thing happened the next day. Moses and Aaron were within the palace, and the new guard had not been able to hinder their passing. Pharaoh questioned his servants, how it had been possible for the two old men to enter, and they said: \"We know it not! Through the doors they did not come. Surely, they must be magicians.\" Not enough that the palace was guarded by a host, at each entrance two lions were stationed, and in terror of being torn to pieces none dared approach the doors, and none could go within until the lion tamer came and led the beasts away. Now Balaam and all the other sacred scribes of Egypt advised that the keepers loose the lions at the approach of Moses and Aaron. But their advice availed naught. Moses had but to raise his rod, and the lions bounded toward him joyously, and followed at his feet, gambolling like dogs before their master on his return home. Within the palace, Moses and Aaron found seventy secretaries busy with Pharaoh's correspondence, which was carried on in seventy languages. At the sight of the messengers of Israel, they started up in great awe, for the two men resembled angels. In stature they were as the cedars of Lebanon, their countenances radiated splendor like the sun, the pupils of their eyes were like the sphere of the morning star, their beards like palm branches, and their mouths emitted flames when they opened them for speech. In their terror, the secretaries flung down pen and paper, and prostrated themselves before Moses and Aaron. Now the two representatives of the children of Israel stepped before Pharaoh, and they spake, \"The God of the Hebrews hath met with us; let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice unto the Lord our God, lest He fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.\" But Pharaoh answered, saying: \"What is the name of your God? Wherein doth His strength consist, and His power? How many countries, how many provinces, how many cities hath He under His dominion? In how many campaigns was He victorious? How many lands did He make subject to Himself? How many cities did He capture? When He goeth to war, how many warriors, riders, chariots, and charioteers doth He lead forth?\" Whereto Moses and Aaron replied: \"His strength and His power fill the whole world. His voice heweth out flames of fire; His words break mountains in pieces. The heaven is His throne, and the earth His footstool. His bow is fire, His arrows are flames, His spears torches, His shield clouds, and His sword lightning flashes. He created the mountains and the valleys, He brought forth spirits and souls, He stretched out the earth by a word, He made the mountains with His wisdom, He forms the embryo in the womb of the mother, He covers the heavens with clouds, at His word the dew and the rain descend earthward, He causes plants to grow from the ground, He nourishes and sustains the whole world, from the horns upon the rem down to the eggs of vermin. Every day He causes men to die, and every day He calls men into life.\" Pharaoh answered, and said: \"I have no need of Him. I have created myself, and if ye say that He causes dew and rain to descend, I have the Nile, the river that hath its source under the tree of life, and the ground impregnated by its waters bears fruit so huge that it takes two asses to carry it. and it is palatable beyond description, for it has three hundred different tastes.\" Then Pharaoh sent to fetch the books of the chronicles of his kingdom from his archives, wherein are recorded the names of the gods of all the nations, to see whether the name of the God of the Hebrews was among them. He read off: \"The gods of Moab, the gods of Ammon, the gods of Zidon—I do not find your God inscribed in the archives!\" Moses and Aaron exclaimed: \"O thou fool! Thou seekest the Living in the graves of the dead. These which thou didst read are the names of dumb idols, but our God is the God of life and the King of eternal life.\" When Pharaoh said the words, \"I know not the Lord,\" God Himself made answer, saying: \"O thou rascal! Thou sayest to My ambassadors, 'I know not the strength and the power of your God'? Lo, I will make thee to stand, for to show thee My power, and that My Name may be declared throughout all the earth.\" Having searched his list of the gods of the nations in vain for a mention of the God of the Hebrews, Pharaoh cited before him the wise men of Egypt, and he said to them: \"Have ye ever heard the name of the God of these people?\" They replied, \"We have been told that He is a son of the wise, the son of ancient kings.\" Then spake God, saying, \"O ye fools! Ye call yourselves wise men, but Me ye call only the son of the wise. Verily, I will set at naught all your wisdom and your understanding.\" Pharaoh persisted in his obduracy, even after Moses and Aaron had performed the miracle of the rod. At the time when the two Hebrews succeeded in entering the palace, guarded as it was by lions, Pharaoh had sent for his magicians, at their head Balaam and his two sons Jannes and Jambres, and when they appeared before him, he told them of the extraordinary incident, how the lions had followed the two old men like dogs, and fawned upon them. It was Balaam's opinion that they were simply magicians like himself and his companions, and he prayed the king to have them come before him together with themselves, to test who were the master magicians, the Egyptians or the Hebrews. Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and he said to them: \"Who will believe you when you say that you are the ambassadors of God, as you pretend to be, if you do not convince men by performing wonders?\" Thereupon Aaron cast his rod to the ground, and it became a serpent. Pharaoh laughed aloud. \"What,\" he exclaimed, \"is this all your God can do? It is the way of merchants to carry merchandise to a place if there is none of it there, but would anyone take brine to Spain or fish to Accho? It seems you do not know that I am an adept in all sorts of magic!\" He ordered little school children to be brought, and they repeated the wonder done by Moses and Aaron; indeed, Pharaoh's own wife performed it. Jannes and Jambres, the sons of Balaam, derided Moses, saying, \"Ye carry straw to Ephrain!\" whereto Moses answered, \"To the place of many vegetables, thither carry vegetables.\" To show the Egyptians that Aaron could do something with his rod that their magicians could not imitate, God caused the serpent into which His rod had been changed to swallow up all the rods of the magicians. But Balaam and his associates said: \"There is nothing marvellous or astonishing in this feat. Your serpent has but devoured our serpents, which is in accordance with a law of nature, one living being devours another. If thou wishest us to acknowledge that the spirit of God worketh in thee, then cast thy rod to the earth, and if, being wood, it swallows up our rods of wood, then we shall acknowledge that the spirit of God is in thee.\" Aaron stood the test. After his rod had resumed its original form, it swallowed up the rods of the Egyptians, and yet its bulk showed no increase. This caused Pharaoh to reflect, whether this wonderful rod of Aaron might not swallow up also him and his throne. Nevertheless he refused to obey the behest of God, to let Israel go, saying, \"Had I Jacob-Israel himself here before me, I should put trowel and bucket on his shoulder.\" And to Moses and Aaron, he said, \"Because ye, like all the rest of the tribe of Levi, are not compelled to labor, therefore do ye speak, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.' If you had asked for a thousand people, or two thousand, I should have fulfilled your request, but never will I consent to let six hundred thousand men go away.\"",

      "content": "Beside refusing to dismiss the children of Israel, he ordered, on the very day of Moses and Aaron's audience with him, that the people be required to deliver the prescribed tale of bricks, though the taskmasters were not as heretofore to give them straw to make brick. Another decree was, that the children of Israel were not to be permitted to rest on the Sabbath, for Pharaoh knew that they used the leisure for reading the rolls that described their redemption. All this was a part of God's plan, the oppression of Israel was to be increased the closer the end approached. As they wandered up and down the land of Egypt gathering the straw they needed for the due tale of bricks, they were maltreated by the Egyptians if they caught them on their fields. Such unkind acts perpetrated by the whole people made it impossible for them to cast the entire blame for the bondage of Israel upon Pharaoh. All the Egyptians showed cruelty to the Israelites on their straw foraging expeditions, and therefore the Divine punishment descended upon all alike. This frightful time of Israel's extreme suffering lasted six months. Meantime Moses went to Midian, leaving Aaron alone in Egypt. When Moses returned at the end of the reign of terror, two of the Israelitish officers accosted him and Aaron, and heaped abuse upon them for having increased the woes of their people rather than diminished them. They spake, saying, \"If ye are truly the ambassadors of God, then may He judge between us and Pharaoh. But if you are seeking to bring about the redemption of Israel on your own account, then may God judge between you and Israel. You are responsible for the widespread stench now issuing from the Israelitish corpses used as bricks for building when our tale was not complete. The Egyptians had but a faint suspicion that we were waiting for our redemption. It is your fault if they are fully conscious of it now. We are in the quandary of the poor sheep that has been dragged away by a wolf. The shepherd pursues the robber, catches up with him, and tries to snatch the sheep from his jaws, and the wretched victim, pulled this way by the wolf and that way by the shepherd, is torn to pieces. Thus Israel fares between you and Pharaoh.\" The two officers that spake these stinging words were Dathan and Abiram, and it was neither the first nor the last time they inflicted an injury upon Moses. The other Israelitish officers were gentle and kind; they permitted themselves to be beaten by the taskmasters rather than prod the laborers of their own people put under their surveillance. The cruel suffering to which his people was exposed caused Moses to speak to God thus: \"I have read the book of Genesis through, and I found the doom in it pronounced upon the generation of the deluge. It was a just judgment. I found also the punishments decreed against the generation of the confusion of tongues, and against the inhabitants of Sodom. These, too, were just. But what hath this nation of Israel done unto Thee, that it is oppressed more than any other nation in history? Is it because Abraham said, 'Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit the land?' and Thou didst rebuke him for his small faith, saying, 'Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs'? Why, then, are not the descendants of Esau and Ishmael held in bondage, too? Are they not likewise of the seed of Abraham? But if Thou wilt say, 'What concern is it of mine?' then I ask Thee, Why didst Thou send me hither as Thy messenger? Thy great, exalted, and terrible Name is feared in all the earth, yet Pharaoh heard me pronounce it, and he refuses obedience. I know Thou wilt redeem Israel in Thine own good time, and it is of little moment to Thee that now they are immuring living Israelites in these buildings.\" Were He a God of justice only, the Lord would have slain Moses for the audacity of his last words, but in view of his having spoken as he had only out of compassion with Israel, the Lord dealt graciously with him. He answered Moses, saying, \"Thou shalt see what I will do to Pharaoh,\" words conveying to Moses, that although he would be witness to the chastisement of Pharaoh, he would not be present at that of the thirty-one kings of Canaan. Thus he was rebuked for the unbecoming language he had used in addressing God. At the same time God's words were a rejoinder to another speech by Moses. He had said: \"O Lord of the world, I know well that Thou wilt bring Thy children forth from Egypt. O that Thou wouldst make use of another instrument, for I am not worthy of being the redeemer of Thy children.\" God made answer thereto: \"Yes, Moses, thou art worthy thereof. Through thee My children will be brought forth out of Egypt. Thou shalt see what I will do to Pharaoh.\" At the same time God called him to account for having so little faith. He said: \"O for the departed, their like cannot be found any more! I appeared unto Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as El Shaddai, God Almighty, but I was not known to them by My name Adonai, God All-Merciful, as I appeared unto thee. Nevertheless they did not cast aspersions upon My acts. I spake to Abraham, 'Unto thee will I give the land,' but when he was about to bury Sarah, he had to pay out silver and buy a resting-place for her body; and yet he did not find fault with Me. I spake to Isaac, 'Unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands,' but when he desired water to drink, he had to strive with the herdsmen of Gerar; and yet he did not find fault with Me. I spake to Jacob, 'The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed,' but when he wanted to spread his tent, he had to acquire a parcel of ground for an hundred pieces of money; and yet he did not find fault with Me. None of them asked to know My Name. But thou didst demand to know it at the very first, when I desired to send thee down into Egypt, and after I revealed it to thee, thou didst speak, saying, 'Thou didst tell me that Thou art called Compassionate and Gracious, Longsuffering and Merciful, but as soon as I pronounced this Name before Pharaoh, misfortune descended upon the people of Israel.' Now I desire to fulfil My covenant with the three Patriarchs, and give their posterity the promised land, as a reward for the unquestioning faith of the Fathers, and also as a reward to the people, who, in spite of their suffering, did not find fault with My deeds. For this will I give them the land, which they do not deserve to possess for other reasons. I swear that I will do thus!\" God pronounced this oath, to banish all fear from the mind of Moses, that He might act only in accordance with His attribute of justice, and thus delay the redemption of Israel for a time, on account of the sins of the people. Now the redemption of Israel was a settled fact. But before Moses and Aaron could start on the work of delivering their people, God called various points to their attention, which He bade them consider in their undertaking. He spake to them, saying: \"My children are perverse, passionate, and troublesome. You must be prepared to stand their abuse, to the length of being pelted with stones by them. I send you to Pharaoh, and although I will punish him according to his deserts, yet you must not fail in the respect due to him as a ruler. Furthermore, be careful to take the elders of the people into your counsel, and let your first step toward redemption be to make the people give up the worship of idols.\" The last was a most difficult task, and the words of God concerning it wrung the exclamation from Moses: \"See, the children of Israel will not hearken unto me. How, then, should Pharaoh hearken unto me?\" It was the third time Moses declined to go on the errand of God. Now the Divine patience was exhausted, and Moses was subjected to punishment. At first God had revealed Himself only to Moses, and the original intention had been that he alone was to perform all the miracles, but henceforth the word of God was addressed to Aaron as well, and he was given a share in doing the wonders.",

      "content": "God divided the ten punishments decreed for Egypt into four parts, three of the plagues He committed to Aaron, three to Moses, one to the two brothers together, and three He reserved for Himself. Aaron was charged with those, that proceeded from the earth and the water, the elements that are composed of more or less solid parts, from which are fashioned all the corporeal, distinctive entities, while the three entrusted to Moses were those that proceeded from the air and the fire, the elements that are most prolific of life. The Lord is a man of war, and as a king of flesh and blood devises various stratagems against his enemy, so God attacked the Egyptians in various ways. He brought ten plagues down upon them. When a province rises up in rebellion, its sovereign lord first sends his army against it, to surround it and cut off the water supply. If the people are contrite, well and good; if not, he brings noise makers into the field against them. If the people are contrite, well and good; if not, he orders darts to be discharged against them. If the people are contrite, well and good; if not, he orders his legions to assault them. If the people are contrite, well and good; if not, he causes bloodshed and carnage among them. If the people are contrite, well and good; if not, he directs a stream of hot naphtha upon them. If the people are contrite, well and good; if not, he hurls projectiles at them from his ballistae. If the people are contrite, well and good; if not, he has scaling-ladders set up against their walls. If the people are contrite, well and good; if not, he casts them into dungeons. If the people are contrite, well and good; if not, he slays their magnates. Thus did God proceed against the Egyptians. First He cut off their water supply by turning their rivers into blood. They refused to let the Israelites go, and He sent the noisy, croaking frogs into their entrails. They refused to let the Israelites go, and He brought lice against them, which pierced their flesh like darts. They refused to let the Israelites go, and He sent barbarian legions against them, mixed hordes of wild beasts. They refused to let the Israelites go, and He brought slaughter upon them, a very grievous pestilence. They refused to let the Israelites go, and He poured out naphtha over them, burning blains. They refused to let the Israelites go, and He caused His projectiles, the hail, to descend upon them. They refused to let the Israelites go, and He placed scaling-ladders against the wall for the locusts, which climbed them like men of war. They refused to let the Israelites go, and He cast them into dungeon darkness. They refused to let the Israelites go, and He slew their magnates, their first-born sons. The plagues that God sent upon the Egyptians corresponded to the deeds they bad perpetrated against the children of Israel. Because they forced the Israelites to draw water for them, and also hindered them from the use of the ritual baths, He changed their water into blood. Because they had said to the Israelites, \"Go and catch fish for us,\" He brought frogs up against them, making them to swarm in their kneading-troughs and their bedchambers and hop around croaking in their entrails. It was the severest of all the ten plagues. Because they had said to the Israelites, \"Go and sweep and clean our houses, our courtyards, and our streets,\" He changed the dust of the air into lice, so that the vermin lay piled up in heaps an ell high, and when the Egyptians put on fresh garments, they were at once infested with the insects. The fourth plague was an invasion of the land by hordes of all sorts of wild animals, lions, wolves, panthers, bears, and others. They overran the houses of the Egyptians, and when they closed their doors to keep them out, God caused a little animal to come forth from the ground, and it got in through the windows, and split open the doors, and made a way for the bears, panthers, lions, and wolves, which swarmed in and devoured the people down to the infants in their cradles. If an Egyptian entrusted his ten children to an Israelite, to take a walk with them, a lion would come and snatch away one of the children, a bear would carry off the second, a serpent the third, and so on, and in the end the Israelite returned home alone. This plague was brought upon them because they were in the habit of bidding the Israelites go and catch wolves and lions for their circuses, and they sent them on such errands, to make them take up their abode in distant deserts, where they would be separated from their wives, and could not propagate their race. Then God brought a grievous murrain upon their cattle, because they had pressed the Israelites into their service as shepherds, and assigned remote pasturing places to them, to keep them away from their wives. Therefore the murrain came and carried off all the cattle in the flocks the Israelites were tending. The sixth plague was a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast. This was the punishment of the Egyptians, because they would say to the children of Israel, \"Go and prepare a bath for us unto the delight of our flesh and our bones.\" Therefore they were doomed to suffer with boils that inflamed their flesh, and on account of the itch they could not leave off scratching. While the Egyptians suffered thus, the children of Israel used their baths. Because they had sent the Israelites forth into the fields, to plough and sow, hail was sent down upon them, and their trees and crops were destroyed. They had been in the habit of saying to the Israelites, \"Go forth, plant ye trees for us, and guard the fruit thereon.\" Therefore God brought the locusts into the Egyptian border, to eat the residue of that which was escaped, which remained unto them from the hail, for the teeth of the locust are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the jaw teeth of a great lion. Because they would throw the Israelites into dungeons, God brought darkness upon them, the darkness of hell, so that they had to grope their way. He that sat could not rise up on his feet, and he that stood could not sit down. The infliction of darkness served another purpose. Among the Israelites there were many wicked men, who refused to leave Egypt, and God determined to put them out of the way. But that the Egyptians might not say they had succumbed to the plague like themselves, God slew them under cover of the darkness, and in the darkness they were buried by their fellow-Israelites, and the Egyptians knew nothing of what had happened. But the number of these wicked men had been very great, and the children of Israel spared to leave Egypt were but a small fraction of the original Israelitish population. The tenth plague was the slaying of the first-born, and it came upon the Egyptians because of their intention to murder the men children of the Israelites at their birth, and, finally, Pharaoh and his host were drowned in the Red Sea, because the Egyptians had caused the men children of the Israelites to be exposed in the water. Each, of the plagues inflicted upon Egypt had another parallel in the cruel treatment accorded to the Israelites. The first was a punishment for the arrogant words spoken by Pharaoh, \"My Nile river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.\" The plague of the frogs God brought down upon the Egyptians, \"because,\" He said, \"the frogs, which sometimes inhabit the water, shall take vengeance upon the Egyptians for having desired to destroy the nation destined to be the bearers of the Torah, and the Torah is likened unto water.\" God sent vermin upon them, saying, \"Let the lice made of the dust of the earth take vengeance upon the Egyptians for having desired to destroy the nation whose seed is like unto the dust of the earth.\" Hordes of beasts, lions and wolves and swarms of serpents, came down upon them, \"because,\" God said, \"these animals shall take vengeance upon the Egyptians for having desired to destroy the nation that is likened unto lions, wolves, and serpents.\" A fatal pestilence was brought upon them, \"because,\" God said, \"death shall take vengeance upon the Egyptians for having desired to destroy the nation that faces death for the glorification of the Name of God.\" They were made to suffer with burning blains, \"because,\" God said, \"the boils coming from the ashes of the furnace shall take vengeance upon the Egyptians for having desired to destroy the nation whose ancestor Abraham walked into the fiery furnace for the glorification of the Name of God.\" He made hail to descend upon them, \"because,\" He said, \"the white hail shall take vengeance upon the Egyptians for having desired to destroy a nation whose sins shall be white.\" The locusts came upon them, \"because,\" God said, \"the locusts, which are My great army, shall take vengeance upon the Egyptians for having desired to destroy the nation that is called My hosts.\" \"Darkness,\" said God, \"which is divided from the light, shall come and take vengeance upon the Egyptians for desiring to destroy the nation upon which shineth the light of the Lord, while gross darkness covers the other peoples.\" The tenth plague, the slaying of the first-born, God inflicted, saying, \"I will take vengeance upon the Egyptians for having desired to destroy the nation that is My firstborn. As the night divided itself for Abraham, that his enemies might be vanquished, so I will pass through Egypt in the middle of the night, and as Abraham was proved by ten temptations, so I will send ten plagues upon Egypt, the enemy of his children.\"",

      "title": "The Plagues Brought Through Aaron",
      "content": "From the infliction of the first of the plagues until the passing of the last, after which the Egyptians yielded all that Moses and Aaron demanded, there elapsed a whole year, for twelve months is the term set by God for the expiation of sins. The deluge lasted one year; Job suffered one year; sinners must endure hell tortures for one year, and the judgment upon Gog at the end of time will be executed for the length of one year. Moses announced the first plague to Pharaoh one morning when the king was walking by the river's brink. This morning walk enabled him to practice a deception. He called himself a god, and pretended that he felt no human needs. To keep up the illusion, he would repair to the edge of the river every morning, and ease nature there while alone and unobserved. At such a time it was that Moses appeared before him, and called out to him, \"Is there a god that hath human needs?\" \"Verily, I am no god,\" replied Pharaoh, \"I only pretend to be one before the Egyptians, who are such idiots, one should consider them asses rather than human beings.\" Then Moses made known to him that God would turn the water into blood, if he refused to let Israel go. In the warning we can discern the difference between God and man. When a mortal harbors the intention to do an injury to an enemy, he lies in wait for the moment when he can strike an unexpected blow. But God is outspoken. He warned Pharaoh and the Egyptians in public whenever a plague was about to descend, and each warning was repeated by Moses for a period of three weeks, although the plague itself endured but a single week. As Pharaoh would not lay the warning to heart, the plague announced by Moses was let loose upon him and his people—the waters were turned into blood. It is a wellknown proverb, \"Beat the idols, and the priests are in terror.\" God smote the river Nile, which the Egyptians worshipped as their god, in order to terrify Pharaoh and his people and force them to do the Divine will. To produce the plague, Aaron took his rod, and stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt. Moses had no part in performing the miracle, for God had said to him, \"The water that watched over thy safety when thou wast exposed in the Nile, shall not suffer harm through thee.\" Aaron had scarcely executed the Divine bidding, when all the water of Egypt became blood, even such as was kept in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone. The very spittle of an Egyptian turned into blood no sooner had he ejected it from his mouth, and blood dripped also from the idols of the Egyptians. The transformation of the waters into blood was intended mainly as a punishment for the oppressors, but it was at the same time a source of profit for the oppressed. It gave the Israelites the opportunity of amassing great wealth. The Egyptians paid them large sums for their water, for if an Egyptian and an Israelite drew water from the same trough, the portion carried off by the Egyptian was bound to be useless, it turned into blood. To be sure, nothing helped the Egyptians in their distress, for though they drank water from the same cup as an Israelite, it became blood in their mouth. However, this plague did not impress Pharaoh as a punishment inflicted in the name of God, because with the help of the Angels of Destruction the magicians of Egypt produced the same phenomenon of changing water into blood. Therefore he hearkened not unto the words of Moses. The next was the plague of the frogs, and again it was Aaron that performed the wonder. He stretched forth his hand with his rod over the rivers, and caused frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. Moses, whose life had been preserved by the water, was kept from poisoning his savior with the reptiles. At first only a single frog appeared, but he began to croak, summoning so many companions that the whole land of Egypt swarmed with them. Wherever an Egyptian took up his stand, frogs appeared, and in some mysterious way they were able to pierce the hardest of metals, and even the marble palaces of the Egyptian nobles afforded no protection against them. If a frog came close to them, the walls split asunder immediately. \"Make way,\" the frogs would call out to the stone, \"that I may do the will of my Creator,\" and at once the marble showed a rift, through which the frogs entered, and then they attacked the Egyptians bodily, and mutilated and overwhelmed them. In their ardor to fulfil the behest of God, the frogs cast themselves into the red-hot flames of the bake-ovens and devoured the bread. Centuries later, the three holy children, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, were ordered by Nebuchadnezzar to pay worship to his idols on penalty of death in the burning furnace, and they said, \"If the frogs, which were under no obligation to glorify the Name of God, nevertheless threw themselves into the fire in order to execute the Divine will concerning the punishment of the Egyptians, how much more should we be ready to expose our lives to the fire for the greater glory of His Name!\" And the zealous frogs were not permitted to go unrewarded. While the others were destroyed from Pharaoh and the Egyptian houses at the moment appointed as the last of the plague, God saved those in the bake-ovens alive, the fire had no power to do them the least harm. Now, although the Egyptian magicians also brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt through the help of demons, Pharaoh nevertheless declared himself ready to let the people go, to sacrifice unto the Lord. The difference between this plague and the first was, that water turned into blood had not caused him any personal inconvenience, while the swarms of frogs inflicted physical suffering, and he gave the promise to Moses to let Israel go, in the hope of ridding himself of the pain he experienced. And Moses in turn promised to entreat God for him on the following day. It could not be done at once, because the seven days' term had not yet elapsed. The prayer offered by Moses in behalf of Pharaoh was granted, all the frogs perished, and their destruction was too swift for them to retire to the water. Consequently the whole land was filled with the stench from the decaying frogs, for they had been so numerous that every man of the Egyptians gathered together four heaps of them. Although the frogs had filled all the market-places and stables and dwellings, they retreated before the Hebrews as if they had been able to distinguish between the two nations, and had known which of them it was proper to abuse, and which to treat with consideration. Beside sparing the Hebrews in the land of Egypt, the frogs kept within the limits of the land, in no wise trenching upon the territory of the neighboring nations. Indeed, they were the means of settling peaceably an old boundary dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia. Wherever they appeared, so far extended the Egyptian domain; all beyond their line belonged to Ethiopia. Pharaoh was like the wicked that cry to God in their distress, and when their fortunes prosper slide back into their old, impious ways. No sooner had the frogs departed from him, his houses, his servants, and his people, than he hardened his heart again, and refused to let Israel go. Thereupon God sent the plague of the lice, the last of those brought upon Egypt through the mediation of Aaron. Moses could have no part in it, \"for,\" said God, \"the earth that afforded thee protection when she permitted thee to hide the slain Egyptian, shall not suffer through thine hand.\" The Egyptian magicians having boasted that they were able to produce the first two plagues,—an empty boast it was, for they did not bring them about with their enchantments, but only because Moses willed them to do it,—God put them to shame with the third plague. They tried in vain to imitate it. The demons could not aid them, for their power is limited to the production of things larger than a barley grain, and lice are smaller. The magicians had to admit, \"This is the finger of God.\" Their failure put an end once for all to their attempts to do as Moses did. But Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and God spake to Moses, saying, \"This wicked fellow remains hard of heart, in spite of the three plagues. The fourth shall be much worse than those which have preceded it. Go to him, therefore, and warn him, it would be well for him to let My people go, that the plague come not upon him.\"",

      "content": "The fourth plague was also announced to the king early in the morning by the river's brink. Pharaoh went thither regularly, for he was one of the magi, who need water for their enchantments. Moses' daily morning visits were beginning to annoy him, and he left the house early, in the hope of circumventing his monitor. But God, who knows the thoughts of man, sent Moses to Pharaoh at the very moment of his going forth. The warning of the plague that was imminent not having had any effect upon Pharaoh, God sent the fourth plague upon Egypt, a mixed horde of wild animals, lions, bears, wolves, and panthers, and so many birds of prey of different kinds that the light of the sun and the moon was darkened as they circled through the air. These beasts came upon the Egyptians as a punishment for desiring to force the seed of Abraham to amalgamate with the other nations. God retaliated by bringing a mixture upon them that cost them their life. As Pharaoh had been the first of the Egyptians to lay evil plans against the children of Israel, so he was the first upon whom descended punishment. Into his house the mixed horde of beasts came first of all, and then into the houses of the rest of the Egyptians. Goshen, the land inhabited by the Israelites, was spared entirely, for God put a division between the two peoples. It is true, the Israelites had committed sins enough to deserve punishment, but the Holy One, blessed be He, permitted the Egyptians to act as a ransom for Israel. Again Pharaoh expressed his willingness to let the children of Israel sacrifice unto their God, but they were to stay in the land and do it, not go outside, into the wilderness. Moses pointed out to Pharaoh how unbecoming it would be for the Israelites to sacrifice, before the very eyes of his people, the animals that the Egyptians worshipped as gods. Then Pharaoh consented to let them go beyond the borders of his land, only they were not to go very far away, and Moses, to mislead him, asked for a three days' journey into the wilderness. But, again, when Moses had entreated God on Pharaoh's behalf, and the horde of wild beasts had vanished, the king hardened his heart, and did not let the people go. The cessation of the fourth plague was as miraculous as the plague itself. The very animals that had been slain by the Egyptians in self-defense returned to life and departed from the land with the rest. This was ordained to prevent the wicked oppressors from profiting by the punishment even so much as the value of the hides and the flesh of the dead animals. It had not been so with the useless frogs, they had died on the spot, and their carcasses had remained where they fell. The fifth plague inflicted by God upon the Egyptians was a grievous pestilence, which mowed down the cattle and beasts chiefly, yet it did not spare men altogether. This pestilence was a distinct plague, but it also accompanied all the other plagues, and the death of many Egyptians was due to it. The Israelites again came off unscathed. Indeed, if an Israelite had a just claim upon a beast held by an Egyptian, it, too, was spared, and the same good fortune waited upon such cattle as was the common property of Israelites and Egyptians. The sixth plague, the plague of boils, was produced by Moses and Aaron together in a miraculous way. Each took a handful of ashes of the furnace, then Moses held the contents of the two heaps in the hollow of one of his hands, and sprinkled the ashes tip toward the heaven, and it flew so high that it reached the Divine throne. Returning earthward, it scattered over the whole land of Egypt, a space equal to four hundred square parasangs. The small dust of the ashes produced leprosy upon the skin of the Egyptians, and blains of a peculiar kind, soft within and dry on top. The first five plagues the magicians had tried to imitate, and partly they had succeeded. But in this sixth plague they could not stand before Moses, and thenceforth they gave up the attempt to do as he did. Their craft had all along been harmful to themselves. Although they could produce the plagues, they could not imitate Moses in causing them to disappear. They would put their hands into their bosom, and draw them out white with leprosy, exactly like Moses, but their flesh remained leprous until the day of their death. And the same happened with all the other plagues that they imitated: until their dying day they were afflicted with the ills they produced. As Pharaoh had wittingly hardened his heart with each of the first five plagues, and refused to turn from his sinful purpose, God punished him thereafter in such wise that he could not mend his ways if he would. God said, \"Even though he should desire to do penance now, I will harden his heart until he pays off the whole of his debt.\" Pharaoh had observed that whenever he walked on the brink of the Nile, Moses would intercept him. He therefore gave up his morning walk. But God bade Moses seek the king in his palace in the early hours of the day and urge him to repent of his evil ways. Therefore Moses spake to him as follows, in the name of God: \"O thou villain! Thou thinkest that I cannot destroy thee from the world. Consider, if I had desired it, instead of smiting the cattle, I might have smitten thee and thy people with the pestilence, and thou wouldst have been cut off from the earth. I inflicted the plague only in such degree as was necessary to show thee My power, and that My Name may be declared throughout all the earth. But thou dost not leave off treading My people underfoot. Behold, to-morrow when the sun passes this point,\"—whereat Moses made a stroke upon the wall— \"I will cause a very grievous hail to pour down, such as will be only once more, when I annihilate Gog with hail, fire, and brimstone.\" But God's lovingkindness is so great that even in His wrath He has mercy upon the wicked, and as His chief object was not to injure men and beasts, but to damage the vegetation in the fields of the Egyptians, He bade Moses admonish Pharaoh to send and hasten in his cattle and all that he had in the field. But the warning fell on heedless ears. Job was the only one to take it to heart, while Pharaoh and his people regarded not the word of the Lord. Therefore the Lord let the hail smite both man and beast, instead of confining it to the herbs and the trees of the field, as He had intended from the first. As a rule, fire and water are elements at war with each other, but in the hailstones that smote the land of Egypt they were reconciled. A fire rested in the hailstones as the burning wick swims in the oil of a lamp; the surrounding fluid cannot extinguish the flame. The Egyptians were smitten either by the hail or by the fire. In the one case as the other their flesh was seared, and the bodies of the many that were slain by the hail were consumed by the fire. The hailstones heaped themselves up like a wall, so that the carcasses of the slain beasts could not be removed, and if the people succeeded in dividing the dead animals and carrying their flesh off, the birds of prey would attack them on their way home, and snatch their prize away. But the vegetation in the field suffered even more than man and beast, for the hail came down like an axe upon the trees and broke them. That the wheat and the spelt were not crushed was a miracle. Now, at last, Pharaoh acknowledged, and said, \"The Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. He was righteous when He bade us hasten in our cattle from before the hail, and I and my people were wicked, for we heeded not His warning, and men and beasts were found in the field by the hail, and slain.\" Again he begged Moses to supplicate God in his behalf, that He turn the plague away, and he promised to let the children of Israel go. Moses consented to do his will, saying, however: \"Think not that I do not know what will happen after the plague is stayed. I know that thou and thy servants, ye will fear the Lord God, once His punishment is removed, as little as ye feared Him before. But to show His greatness, I will pray to Him to make the hail to cease.\" Moses went a short distance out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the Lord, for he did not desire to pray to God within, where there were many idols and images. At once the hail remained suspended in the air. Part of it dropped down while Joshua was engaged in battle with the Amorites, and the rest God will send down in His fury against Gog. Also the thunders ceased at Moses' intercession, and were stored up for a later time, for they were the noise which the Lord made the host of the Syrians to hear at the siege of Samaria, wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight. As Moses had foreseen, so it happened. No sooner had the hail stopped than Pharaoh abandoned his resolve, and refused to let Israel go. Moses lost no time in announcing the eighth plague to him, the plague of the locusts. Observing that his words had made an impression upon the king's counsellors, he turned and went out from Pharaoh, to give them the opportunity of discussing the matter among themselves. And, indeed, his servants urged Pharaoh to let the Israelites go and serve the Lord their God. But, again, when Moses insisted that the whole people must go, the young and the old, the sons and the daughters, Pharaoh demurred, saying, \"I know it to be customary for young men and old men to take part in sacrifices, but surely not little children, and when you demand their presence, too, you betray your evil purpose. It is but a pretense, your saying that you will go a three days' journey into the wilderness, and then return. You mean to escape and never come back. I will have nothing more to do with the matter. My god Baal-zephon will oppose you in the way, and hinder you on your journey.\" Pharaoh's last words were a dim presentiment. As a magician he foresaw that on their going forth from Egypt the children of Israel would find themselves in desperate straits before the sanctuary of Baal-zephon. Pharaoh was not content with merely denying the request preferred by Moses and Aaron. He ordered them to be forcibly expelled from the palace. Then God sent the plague of the locusts announced by Moses before. They ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left, and there remained not any green thing. And again Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, to ask their forgiveness, both for his sin against the Lord God, in not having hearkened unto His word, and for his sin against them, in having chased them forth and intended to curse them. Moses, as before, prayed to God in Pharaoh's behalf, and his petition was granted, the plague was taken away, and in a rather surprising manner. When the swarms of locusts began to darken the land, the Egyptians caught them and preserved them in brine as a dainty to be eaten. Now the Lord turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea. Even those they were keeping in their pots flew up and away, and they had none of the expected profit. The last plague but one, like those which had preceded it, endured seven days. All the time the land was enveloped in darkness, only it was not always of the same degree of density. During the first three days, it was not so thick but that the Egyptians could change their posture when they desired to do so. If they were sitting down, they could rise up, and if they were standing, they could sit down. On the fourth, fifth, and sixth days, the darkness was so dense that they could not stir from their place. They either sat the whole time, or stood; as they were at the beginning, so they remained until the end. The last day of darkness overtook the Egyptians, not in their own land, but at the Red Sea, on their pursuit of Israel. The darkness was not of the ordinary, earthly kind; it came from hell, and it could be felt. It was as thick as a dinar, and all the time it prevailed a celestial light brightened the dwellings of the children of Israel, whereby they could see what the Egyptians were doing under cover of the darkness. This was of great advantage to them, for when they were about to go forth from the land, and they asked their neighbors to lend them raiment, and jewels of gold and jewels of silver, for the journey, the Egyptians tried to deny having any in their possession. But the children of Israel, having spied out all their treasures during the days of darkness, could describe the objects they needed with accuracy, and designate their hiding-places. The Egyptians reasoned that the words of the Israelites could be taken implicitly as they spoke them, for if they had had any idea of deceiving them, asking for a loan when they intended to keep what they laid hands on, they might have taken unobserved during the days of darkness whatever: they desired. Hence the Egyptians felt no hesitation in lending the children of Israel all the treasures they asked for. The darkness was of such a nature that it could not be dispelled by artificial means. The light of the fire kindled for household uses was either extinguished by the violence of the storm, or else it was made invisible and swallowed up in the density of the darkness. Sight, that most indispensable of all the external senses, though unimpaired, was deprived of its office, for nothing could be discerned, and all the other senses were overthrown like subjects whose leader has fallen. None was able to speak or to hear, nor could anyone venture to take food, but they lay themselves down in quiet and hunger, their outward senses in a trance. Thus they remained, overwhelmed by the affliction, until Moses had compassion on them again, and besought God in their behalf, who granted him the power of restoring fine weather, light instead of darkness and day instead of night. Intimidated by this affliction, Pharaoh permitted the people to go, the little ones as well as the men and the women, only he asked that they let their flocks and their herds be stayed. But Moses said: \"As thou livest, our cattle also shall go with us. Yea, if but the hoof of an animal belongs to an Israelite, the beast shall not be left behind in Egypt.\" This speech exasperated Pharaoh to such a degree that he threatened Moses with death in the day he should see his face again. At this very moment the Lord appeared unto Moses, and bade him inform Pharaoh of the infliction of the last plague, the slaying of the first-born. It was the first and the last time that God revealed Himself in the royal palace. He chose the residence of Pharaoh on this occasion that Moses might not be branded as a liar, for he had replied to Pharaoh's threat of killing him if he saw his face again, with the words, \"Thou hast spoken well; I will see thy face again no more.\" With a loud voice Moses proclaimed the last plague, closing his announcement with the words: \"And all these thy servants shall come down unto me and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out: and all the people that follow thee; and after that I will go out.\" Moses knew well enough that Pharaoh himself would come and urge him to lead Israel forth with as great haste as possible, but he mentioned only the servants of the king, and not the king himself, because he never forgot the respect due to a ruler.",

      "title": "The First Passover",
      "content": "When the time approached in which, according to the promise made to Abraham, his children would be redeemed, it was seen that they had no pious deeds to their credit for the sake of which they deserved release from bondage. God therefore gave them two commandments, one bidding them to sacrifice the paschal lamb and one to circumcise their sons. Along with the first they received the calendar in use among the Jews, for the Passover feast is to be celebrated on the fifteenth day of the month of Nisan, and with this month the year is to begin. But the computations for the calendar are so involved that Moses could not understand them until God showed him the movements of the moon plainly. There were three other things equally difficult, which Moses could comprehend only after God made him to see them plainly. They were the compounding of the holy anointing oil, the construction of the candlestick in the Tabernacle, and the animals the flesh of which is permitted or prohibited. Also the determination of the new moon was the subject of special Divine teaching. That Moses might know the exact procedure, God appeared to him in a garment with fringes upon its corners, bade Moses stand at His right hand and Aaron at His left, and then, citing Michael and Gabriel as witnesses, He addressed searching questions to the angels as to how the new moon had seemed to them. Then the Lord addressed Moses and Aaron, saying, \"Thus shall My children proclaim the new moon, on the testimony of two witnesses and through the president of the court. When Moses appeared before the children of Israel and delivered the Divine message to them, telling them that their redemption would come about in this month of Nisan, they said: \"How is it possible that we should be redeemed? Is not the whole of Egypt full of our idols? And we have no pious deeds to show making us worthy of redemption.\" Moses made reply, and said: \"As God desires your redemption, He pays no heed to your idols; He passes them by. Nor does He look upon your evil deeds, but only upon the good deeds of the pious among you.\" God would not, indeed, have delivered Israel if they had not abandoned their idol worship. Unto this purpose He commanded them to sacrifice the paschal lamb. Thus they were to show that they had given up the idolatry of the Egyptians, consisting in the worship of the ram. The early law was different from the practice of later times, for they were bidden to select their sacrificial animal four days before the day appointed for the offering, and to designate it publicly as such, to show that they did not stand in awe of the Egyptians. With a heavy heart the Egyptians watched the preparations of the Israelites for sacrificing the animals they worshipped. Yet they did not dare interpose an objection, and when the time came for the offering to be made, the children of Israel could perform the ceremonies without a tremor, seeing that they knew, through many days' experience, that the Egyptians feared to approach them with hostile intent. There was another practice connected with the slaughter of the paschal lamb that was to show the Egyptians how little the Israelites feared them. They took of the blood of the animal, and openly put it on the two side posts and on the lintel of the doors of their houses. Moses communicated the laws regulating the Passover sacrifice to the elders, and they in turn made them known to the people at large. The elders were commended for having supported the leader at his first appearance, for their faith in Moses caused the whole people to adhere to him at once. Therefore God spake, saying: \"I will reward the elders for inspiring the people with confidence in Moses. They shall have the honor of delivering Israel. They shall lead the people to the Passover sacrifice, and through this the redemption will be brought about.\" The ceremonies connected with the Passover sacrifice had the purpose of conveying instruction to Israel about the past and the future alike. The blood put on the two side posts and on the lintel of their doors was to remind them of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and the bunch of hyssop for sprinkling the blood on the doors was to imply that, although Israel's position among the peoples of the earth is as lowly as that of the hyssop among the plants, yet this little nation is bound together like the bunch of hyssop, for it is God's peculiar treasure. The paschal sacrifice afforded Moses the opportunity for inducing the children of Israel to submit themselves to circumcision, which many had refused to do until then in spite of his urgent appeals. But God has means of persuasion. He caused a wind to blow that wafted the sweet scents of Paradise toward Moses' paschal lamb, and the fragrance penetrated to all parts of Egypt, to the distance of a forty days' journey. The people were attracted in crowds to Moses' lamb, and desired to partake of it. But he said, \"This is the command of God, 'No uncircumcised person shall eat thereof,' \" and they all decided to undergo circumcision. When the Lord passed through the land of Egypt, He blessed every Israelite for his fulfilment of the two commands, the command of the paschal sacrifice and the command regarding circumcision.\" The Lord performed a great miracle for the Israelites. As no sacrifice may be eaten beyond the borders of the Holy Land, all the children of Israel were transported thither on clouds, and after they had eaten of the sacrifice, they were carried back to Egypt in the same way.",

      "title": "The Smiting Of The First-born",
      "content": "When Moses announced the slaying of the first-born, the designated victims all repaired to their fathers, and said: \"Whatever Moses hath foretold has been fulfilled. Let the Hebrews go, else we shall all die.\" But the fathers replied, \"It is better for one of every ten of us to die, than the Hebrews should execute their purpose.\" Then the first-born repaired to Pharaoh, to induce him to dismiss the children of Israel. So far from granting their wish, he ordered his servants to fall upon the first-born and beat them, to punish them for their presumptuous demand. Seeing that they could not accomplish their end by gentle means, they attempted to bring it about by force. Pharaoh and all that opposed the wishes of the first-born were of the opinion that the loss of so inconsiderable a percentage of the population was a matter of small moment. They were mistaken in their calculation, for the Divine decree included not only the first-born sons, but also the first-born daughters, and not only the first-born of the marriages then existing, but also the first-born issuing from previous alliances of the fathers and the mothers, and as the Egyptians led dissolute lives, it happened not rarely that each of the ten children of one woman was the first-born of its father. Finally, God decreed that death should smite the oldest member of every household, whether or not he was the first-born of his parents. What God resolves is executed. At the exact instant marking the middle of the night, so precise that only God Himself could determine and discern it, He appeared in Egypt, attended by nine thousand myriads of the Angels of Destruction who are fashioned some of hail and some of flames, and whose glances drive terror and trembling to the heart of the beholder. These angels were about to precipitate themselves into the work of annihilation, but God restrained them, saying, \"My wrath will not be appeased until I Myself execute vengeance upon the enemies of Israel.\" Those among the Egyptians who gave credence to Moses' words, and tried to shield their first-born children from death, sent them to their Hebrew neighbors, to spend the fateful night with them, in the hope that God would exempt the houses of the children of Israel from the plague. But in the morning, when the Israelites arose from their sleep, they found the corpses of the Egyptian fugitives next to them. That was the night in which the Israelites prayed before lying down to sleep: \"Cause us, O Lord our God, to lie down in peace, remove Satan from before us and from behind us, and guard our going out and our coming in unto life and unto peace,\" for it was Satan that had caused frightful bloodshed among the Egyptians. Among the slain there were, beside the Egyptian firstborn, also the first-born of other nationalities residing in Egypt, as well as the Egyptian first-born dwelling outside of their own land. Even the long dead of the first-born were not spared. The dogs dragged their corpses out of their graves in the houses, for it was the Egyptian custom to inter the dead at home. At the appalling sight the Egyptians mourned as though the bereavement had befallen them but recently. The very monuments and statues erected to the memory of the first-born dead were changed into dust, which was scattered and flew out of sight. Moreover, their slaves had to share the fate of the Egyptians, and no less the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon, for none was so low but he hated the Hebrews, and rejoiced when the Egyptians decreed their persecution. The female slaves that ground corn between mill-stones were in the habit of saying, \"We do not regret our servitude, if only the Israelites are gagged, too. In dealing out punishment to these aliens in the land of Egypt, God showed that He was at once the Master of the land and the Lord over all the gods of the nations, for if the slaves and the captives of war had not been smitten, they would have said, \"Mighty is our god, who helped us in this plague.\" For the same reason all the idols of the Egyptians were swept out of existence in that night. The stone idols were ground into dust, the wooden idols rotted, and those made of metal melted away, and so the Egyptians were kept from ascribing their chastisement to the wrath of their own gods. Likewise the Lord God slew the first-born of the cattle, for the Egyptians paid worship to animals, and they would have attributed their misfortunes to them. In all these ways the Lord showed them that their gods were but vanity.",

      "content": "Pharaoh rose up in the night of the smiting of the firstborn. He waited not for the third hour of the morning, when kings usually arise, nor did he wait to be awakened, but he himself roused his slaves from their slumber, and all the other Egyptians, and together they went forth to seek Moses and Aaron. He knew that Moses had never spoken an untruth, and as he had said, \"I will see thy face again no more,\" he could not count upon Moses' coming to him. There remained nothing for him to do but go in search of the Israelitish leader. He did not know where Moses lived, and he had great difficulty and lost much time in looking for his house, for the Hebrew lads of whom he made inquiries when he met them in the street played practical jokes on him, misdirected him, and led him astray. Thus he wandered about a long time. all the while weeping and crying out, \"O my friend Moses, pray for me to God!\" Meanwhile Moses and Aaron and all Israel beside were at the paschal meal, drinking wine as they sat and leaned to one side, and singing songs in praise of God, the Hallel, which they were the first to recite. When Pharaoh finally reached the door of the house wherein Moses abode, he called to him, and from Moses the question came back, \"Who art thou, and what is thy name?\"—\"I am Pharaoh, who stands here humiliated.\"—Moses asked again: \"Why dost thou come to me thyself? Is it the custom of kings to linger at the doors of common folk?\"—\"I pray thee, my lord,\" returned Pharaoh, \"come forth and intercede for us, else there will not remain a single being in Egypt.\"—\"I may not come forth, for God bath commanded us, 'None of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.' \" —But Pharaoh continued to plead: \"Do but step to the window, and speak with me,\" and when Moses yielded to his importunities, and appeared at the window, the king addressed these words to him: \"Thou didst say yesterday, 'All the first-born in the land of Egypt will die,' but now as many as nine-tenths of the inhabitants have perished.\" Pharaoh was accompanied by his daughter Bithiah, Moses' foster-mother. She reproached him with ingratitude, in having brought down evil upon her and her countrymen. And Moses answered, and said: \"Ten plagues the Lord brought upon Egypt. Hath evil accrued to thee from any of them? Did one of them affect thee?\" And when Bithiah acknowledged that no harm had touched her, Moses continued to speak, \"Although thou art thy mother's firstborn, thou shalt not die, and no evil shall reach thee in the midst of Egypt.\" But Bithiah said, \"Of what advantage is my security to me, when I see the king, my brother, and all his household, and his servants in this evil plight, and look upon their first-born perishing with all the first-born of Egypt?\" And Moses returned, \"Verily, thy brother and his household and the other Egyptians would not hearken to the words of the Lord, therefore did this evil come upon them. Turning to Pharaoh, Moses said: \"In spite of all that hath happened, I will teach thee something, if thou desirest to learn, and thou wilt be spared, and thou wilt not die. Raise thy voice, and say: 'Ye children of Israel, ye are your own masters. Prepare for your journey, and depart from among my people. Hitherto ye were the slaves of Pharaoh, but henceforward ye are under the authority of God. Serve the Lord your God!' \" Moses made him say these words three times, and God caused Pharaoh's voice to be heard throughout the land of Egypt, so that all the inhabitants, the home-born and the aliens, knew that Pharaoh had released the children of Israel from the bondage in which they had languished. And all Israel sang, \"Hallelujah, praise, O ye servants of the Lord, praise the Name of the Lord,\" for they belonged to the Lord, and no more were the servants of Pharaoh. Now the king of Egypt insisted upon their leaving the land without delay. But Moses objected, and said: \"Are we thieves, that we should slink away under cover of the night? Wait until morning.\" Pharaoh, however, urged and begged Moses to depart, confessing that he was anxious about his own person, for he was a first-born son, and he was terrified that death would strike him down, too. Moses dissipated his alarm, though he substituted a new horror, with the words, \"Fear not, there is worse in store for thee!\" Dread seized upon the whole people; every one of the Egyptians was afraid of losing his life, and they all united their prayers with Pharaoh's, and begged Moses to take the Israelites hence. And God spake, Ye shall all find your end, not here, but in the Red Sea!\"",

      "content": "Pharaoh and the Egyptians let their dead lie unburied, while they hastened to help the Israelites load their possessions on wagons, to get them out of the land with as little delay as possible. When they left, they took with them, beside their own cattle, the sheep and the oxen that Pharaoh had ordered his nobles to give them as presents. The king also forced his magnates to beg pardon of the Israelites for all they had suffered, knowing as he did that God forgives an injury done by man to his fellow only after the wrongdoer has recovered the good-will of his victim by confessing and regretting his fault. \"Now, depart!\" said Pharaoh to the Israelites, \"I want nothing from you but that you should pray to God for me, that I may be saved from death.\" The hatred of the Egyptians toward the Israelites changed now into its opposite. They conceived affection and friendship for them, and fairly forced raiment upon them, and jewels of silver and jewels of gold, to take along with them on their journey, although the children of Israel had not yet returned the articles they had borrowed from their neighbors at an earlier time. This action is in part to be explained by the vanity of Pharaoh and his people. They desired to pretend before the world that they were vastly rich, as everybody would conclude when this wealth of their mere slaves was displayed to observers. Indeed, the Israelites bore so much away from Egypt that one of them alone might have defrayed the expense of building and furnishing the Tabernacle. On their leaving the land only the private wealth of the Egyptians was in their hands, but when they arrived at the Red Sea they came into possession of the public treasure, too, for Pharaoh, like all kings, carried the moneys of the state with him on his campaigns, in order to be prepared to hire a relay of mercenaries in case of defeat. Great as the other treasure was, the booty captured at the sea far exceeded it. But if the Israelites loaded themselves down with goods and jewels and money, it was not to gratify love of riches, or, as any usurer might say, because they coveted their neighbors' possessions. In the first place they could look upon their plunder as wages due to them from those they had long served, and, secondly, they were entitled to retaliate on those at whose hands they had suffered wrong. Even then they were requiting them with an affliction far slighter than any one of all they had endured themselves. The plagues did not stay the cruelty of the Egyptian oppressors toward the Hebrews. It continued unabated until the very end of their sojourn in the land. On the day of the exodus, Rachel the daughter of Shuthelah gave birth to a child, while she and her husband together were treading the clay for bricks. The babe dropped from her womb into the clay and sank out of sight. Gabriel appeared, moulded a brick out of the clay containing the child, and carried it to the highest of the heavens, where he made it a footstool before the Divine throne. In that night it was that God looked upon the suffering of Israel, and smote the first-born of the Egyptians, and it is one of the four nights that God has inscribed in the Book of Memorial. The first of the four is that in which God appeared to create the world; all was waste and void, and darkness brooded over the abyss, until the Lord came and spread light round about by His word. The second night is that in which God appeared unto Abraham at the covenant of the pieces. In the third night He appeared in Egypt, slaying the first-born of the Egyptians with His right hand, and protecting the first-born of the Israelites with His left. The fourth night recorded will be that in which the end of the redemption will be accomplished, when the iron yoke of the wicked kingdom will be broken, and the evil-doers will be destroyed. Then will Moses come from the desert, and the Messiah from Rome, each at the head of his flock, and the word of God will mediate between them, causing both to walk with one accord in the same direction. Israel's redemption in future days will happen on the fifteenth of Nisan, the night of Israel's redemption from Egypt, for thus did Moses say, \"In this night God protected Israel against the Angels of Destruction, and in this night He will also redeem the generations of the future.\" Though the actual deliverance from Egypt took place in that night, the Hebrews did not leave the land until the following day. During the same night God requited the Egyptians for their evil deeds in the sight of all the people, the night being as bright as day at the time of the summer solstice. Not one could escape the general chastisement, for by Divine dispensation none was absent from home at the time, so that none could fail to see the chastisement. The angels in heaven learnt what was happening on earth. When they were about to begin their song of praise to God, He silenced them with the words, \"My children on earth are singing now,\" and the celestial hosts had to stop and listen to the song of Israel. Great as the joy of the Hebrews was at their deliverance from the Egyptian bondage, it was exceeded by that of Pharaoh's people at seeing their slaves depart, for with them went the dread of death that had obsessed them. They were like the portly gentleman riding an ass. The rider feels uncomfortable and longs for the moment of alighting, but his longing cannot compare in intensity with that of the ass groaning under the corpulent burden, and when their journey's end is reached, the ass rejoices more than his master. So the Egyptians were happier to be rid of the Hebrews than these were to be free. In general, the Israelites were not in a joyous mood. The strength of men is readily exhausted, mentally and physically, by the strain of a sudden change from slavery to freedom. They did not recover vigor and force until they heard the angel hosts sing songs of praise and joy over the redemption of Israel and the redemption of the Shekinah, for so long as the chosen people is in exile, the Shekinah, who dwells among Israel, is also, as it were, in exile. At the same time, God caused the earth to exhale and send aloft a healing fragrance, which cured them of all their diseases. The exodus of the Israelites began at Raamses, and although the distance from there to the city of Mizraim, where Moses abode, was a forty days' journey, yet they heard the voice of their leader urging them to leave the land. They covered the distance from Raamses to Succoth, a three days' march, in an instant. In Succoth God enveloped them in seven clouds of glory, four hovering in front, behind, and at the two sides of them, one suspended above them, to keep off rain, hail, and the rays of the sun, and one under them to protect them against thorns and snakes. The seventh cloud preceded them, and prepared the way for them, exalting the valleys and making low every mountain and hill. Thus they wandered through the wilderness for forty years. In all that time no artificial lighting was needed; a beam from the celestial cloud followed them into the darkest of chambers, and if one of the people had to go outside of the camp, even thither he was accompanied by a fold of the cloud, covering and protecting him. Only, that a difference might be made between day and night, a pillar of fire took the place of the cloud in the evening. Never for an instant were the people without the one or the other to guide them: the pillar of fire glowed in front of them before the pillar of cloud retired, and in the morning the cloud was there before the fire vanished. The clouds of glory and the pillar of fire were sent for the protection of Israel alone, for none beside, not for the heathen and not for the mixed multitude that went up with them; these had to walk outside of the cloud enclosure. The cavalcade consisted of six hundred thousand heads of families afoot, each accompanied by five children on horseback, and to these must be added the mixed multitude, exceeding the Hebrews vastly in number. So profound was Israel's trust in the Lord, that they followed Moses unmurmuringly into the wilderness, without supplying themselves with provisions. The only edibles they took were the remains of the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs, and these not to satisfy their hunger, but because they were unwilling to separate themselves from what they had prepared lovingly at the command of God. These possessions were so dear to them that they would not entrust them to the beasts of burden, they carried them on their own shoulders. *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LEGENDS OF THE JEWS — VOLUME 2 *** Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™ Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life. Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org. Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate. While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org. This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",
