ILLUSTRATED BY CARBN LOEBEL-FRIID 





Till PIIIT VOLUME BVER TO CATHIE TOCBTHER 
TH1 MYTHJ OP JUDAIIM 


The first anthology of Jewish mythology in English, Tree of Souls reveals a mythical tradition as rich and as 
fascinating as any in the world. Drawing from the Bible, the Pseudepigrapha, the Talmud and Midrash, the 
kabbalistic literature, medieval folklore, Hasidic texts, and oral lore collected in the modern era, Schwartz 
has gathered together nearly 700 of the key Jewish myths. The myths themselves are marvelous. We read of 
Adam’s diamond and the Land of Eretz (where it is always dark) , the fall of Lucifer and the quarrel of the sun 
and the moon, the Treasury of Souls and the Divine Chariot. We discover new tales about the great figures of 
the Hebrew Bible, from Adam to Moses; stories about God’s Bride, the Shekhinah, and the evil temptress. 
Lilith; plus many tales about angels and demons, spirits and vampires, giant beasts and the Golem. Equally 
important, Schwartz provides a wealth of additional information. For each myth, he includes extensive com- 
mentary, revealing the source of the myth and explaining how it relates to other Jewish myths as well as to 
world literature (for instance, comparing Eve s release of evil into the world with Pandora’s). For ease of use. 
Schwartz divides the volume into ten books, Myths of God, Myths of Creation, Myths of Heaven, Myths of 
Hell, Myths of the Holy Word, Myths of the Holy Time, Myths of the Holy People, Myths of the Holy Land. 
Myths of Exile, and Myths of the Messiah. 


Master anthologizer Howard Schwartz builds on a spectrum of approaches in his latest collection, Tree of Souls. 
Like Sir James George Frazer in The Golden Bough, he organizes an international encyclopedic collection of 
tales under broad, evocative categories. Schwartz s Herculean effort amalgamates a vast reference library of 
Jewish knowledge.” -Dora Cash, Hadassah 

A resounding rebuttal to the old accusation that the Jews have no mythology This is that rare book that 

is both a fascinating read for the non-specialist and a turning point for scholarship.”

"Every now and then a work of reference comes along that can be utilized and welcomed 
by the widest categories of readers. Howard Schwartz's Tree of Souls: The Mythology of 
Judaism is precisely such a book. It belongs on the reference shelf of every public or col- 
lege library in synagogue libraries as well, and finally in the home of every individual 
seeking to build a library of essential Jewish books. Schwartz has covered an enormous 
amount of ground, drawing upon biblical, Midrashic, Talmudic, kabbalistic, and Hasidic 
texts as well as oral lore, to put together this comprehensive and extremely readable 
collection. Part of what makes the work so impressive is his detailed identification of 
sources, as well as the way in which he cross-references the almost 700 myths that the 
book contains. The book is also marvelously indexed, first by biblical verses and then by 
subject matter; includes an excellent glossary; and contains a superb bibliography for 
those wishing to do further research." — Citation, 2005 National Jewish Book Award for 
Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism 

" Tree of Souls follows in the footsteps of some of the great collections of Jewish stories 
throughout history. Schwartz's anthology certainly deserves to stand in this distinguished 
line: He has created a Bialik and Ravnitski, or a Ginzberg, for the 21st century. Schwartz 
has done yeoman's work in tracking these various tales down, and the resulting volume 
is enormous in many senses, from its size and heft to its erudition. His efforts leave no 
literary or scholarly stone unturned in attempting to identify and explain the myths. He 
provides highly useful commentaries on the stories. Schwartz's collection is as comfort- 
able with Kafka as it is with Bereshit Rabbah, with 20th-century hasidic tales by Warsaw 
Ghettos rabbis appearing side by side with selections from the Zohar. When one gets 
right down to it, this is a book of stories. Schwartz's achievement in rendering and pro- 
viding them for us is indeed monumental." — Jeremy Dauber, The Jerusalem Report 

" Tree of Souls is a colorful anthology written for educated readers (Jewish or not). In this 
respect, the book resembles Bialik and Ravnitsky's Sefer Ha-Aggadah . But unlike Bialik 
and Ravnitsky's book, Schwartz stretches the limits, branching out into unknown and 
uncharted territory. Here they are, lined up one after another in endless procession — 
famous legends and forgotten ones, legends at the core of our collective culture and leg- 
ends lurking on the sidelines. And this is just a tiny taste of the delights that await readers 
of Schwartz's book, with its cornucopia of texts on every imaginable subject, from every 
historical era, in every conceivable genre." — Avigdor Shinan, Ha'aretz 

"Howard Schwartz's Tree of Souls has taken the Jewish reclamation of myth to an unprec- 
edented level. As a resource, Tree of Souls is phenomenal. No doubt it will take its place 
next to the translation of Bialik and Ravnitzky's Sefer Ha-Aggadah (The Book of Legends) on 
my bookshelf." — Daniel Septimus, Jbooks 

"Schwartz has produced a book that is both accessible and engaging. It is also thor- 
ough. Though no single volume could ever reproduce all the myths in Judaism, Tree of 
Souls contains a remarkably rich collection of traditions, helpfully organized according 
to a number of overarching themes, including myths of God, creation, heaven, hell, 
and so on." — N. R. Deutsch, Choice

For my son, Nati Zohar 


Rabbi Yose taught: "God has a tree of flowering souls in Paradise. 
This tree is surrounded by the four winds of the world. From the 
branches of this tree sprout forth all souls, for they grow upon 
this tree, as is written: 7 am a oppress tree in bloom; your fruit 
issues forth from Me.' (Hos.l4:9). And from the roots of this tree 
sprout the souls of all the righteous ones whose names are 
inscribed there. From this we learn that all souls are the fruit of 
the Holy One, blessed be He."

PREFACE 


A largely unrecognized but quite extensive mythology 1 is embedded throughout Jewish 
literature. The primary myths portrayed in the Bible, especially those in Genesis, became 
the focus of mythic elaboration. The biblical text packs a maximum amount of meaning 
into a minimum number of words, thereby compelling interpretation. An ancient rab- 
binic method of exegesis called midrash, 2 which sought out and inevitably found the 
solution to problems perceived in the biblical text, resulted in the creation of an abundant 
mythology that eventually took on a life of its own. Often the transformation that takes 
place between the early periods of Jewish myth and their later evolution is considerable, 
almost constituting a new set of myths based on the old ones. The sum of all of these 
generations of reimagining the Bible is a Jewish mythology as rich as that of other great 
ancient cultures. These myths may appear either in fully developed form or as widely 
scattered fragments. Often, when these fragments are collected from the extant sources 
and pieced back together, they reveal extensive elaborations of the original myths, often 
in unexpected directions. 

It has been my intention to draw Jewish myths from the full range of Jewish literature. 
This tradition extends from biblical times until the present, and includes texts from in- 
side and outside normative Jewish tradition. For details about the texts included, see "A 
Note on the Sources" on p. 525. 

Because of the considerable differences between the myths deriving from various pe- 
riods, it is difficult to speak of a single or definitive Jewish mythology. Yet it is also clear 
that the seeds of all the major myths are found in the earlier texts, where they are often 
the subject of a profound evolutionary process, a dialectic that alternates between the 
tendency to mythologize Judaism and the inclination to resist such impulses. An atten- 
tive reader should find the permutations of these myths fascinating. I have chosen to 
regard these as organic developments, and I have attempted to draw together the threads 
of these fragmentary myths into coherent ones, where possible. Where contradictory ex- 
planations are found, this has also been noted using the formula "Some say" and "Others 
say." This is intended to indicate the existence of multiple versions of the same myth. 
Some myths derive from a single text, but most have multiple sources, reflecting the 
continuing fascination with specific themes as well as the desire of subsequent genera- 
tions to reinterpret them and make them relevant to their own lives. 

This book has been structured around what I regard as the ten primary categories of 
Jewish mythology: Myths of God, Myths of Creation, Myths of Heaven, Myths of Hell, Myths of 
the Holy Word, Myths of the Holy Time , Myths of the Holy People, Myths of the Holy Land, Myths 
of Exile, and Myths of the Messiah. Each entry includes the myth, usually drawn from mul- 
tiple sources, as well a commentary and its sources. The purpose of the commentary is to 



xxxiv PREFACE 


put the myth in the proper context, provide the biblical verses that inspired or explain it, 
note related myths, and to untangle, as much as possible, the mythic threads it consists of, 
as well as parallels to other mythic traditions. 

Several key modem scholars have considered the question of whether there can be 
said to be a Jewish mythology, and, if so, what its characteristics would be. These include 
Gershom Scholem, Isaiah Tishby, Alexander Altmann, Raphael Patai, Joseph Dan, Moshe 
Idel, Yehuda Liebes, Arthur Green, Michael Fishbane, David J. Halperin, Michael Stone, 
Peter Schafer, Elliot Wolfson, Rachel Elior, Pinchas Giller, Tikva Frymer-Kensky, and Elliot 
K. Ginsburg. I am grateful for their perspectives and insights. In addition, scores of ar- 
ticles have been written about various aspects of virtually all of the myths included here. 
I have noted especially important and relevant articles following the commentaries to 
the myths, under the category of "Studies."

FOREWORD 


The Resonances and Registers of Jewish Myth 
by Elliot K. Ginsburg 


To enter this book is to enter a world thick with meaning, olam u-melo'o, "a world and the 
fullness thereof." 1 In its pages, one can encounter the astonishing range of the Jewish mythic 
imagination: texts and countertexts, brief epigrams and extended chain midrashim, excla- 
mations and sober disquisitions: they are all in there. For Tree of Souls is the product of a 
man, Howard Schwartz, who wears many hats: he is at once a literary artist and master 
editor, who is simultaneously immersed in (and sharpened by) the world of scholarship. 
The resulting work is a gift of the scholarly and literary imagination, and it is a joy to read. 

Jewish mythology and its many voices. One of the most impressive features of this 
work is its capacious understanding of what is authentically Jewish . In consort with most 
contemporary scholars, Schwartz departs from those great Judaic scholars of the 19th 
century who sought to reduce Judaism — in its evolving, plural, oft messy vitality — to an 
idealized set of unchanging beliefs or practices, articulated by a central cast of characters. 
Schwartz listens rather more widely: he exhibits an inclusive, demotic willingness to 
combine different registers and a wide range of provenances. Obscure manuscripts and 
well-known texts reside cheek-by-jowl; so too, polished literary works and oral narra- 
tives. Texts written in Rabbinic Hebrew and Aramaic sit alongside passages from Yid- 
dish, German and Middle-Eastern vernacular. The multi-streamed Rabbinic tradition is 
represented not only by a stunning array of talmudic and midrashic texts, but also by 
later kabbalistic myths with gnostic and sometimes rapturous undertones, hasidic mayses 
(tales) and ethical tracts. The global meets the local as talmudic understandings of soul 
enter into dialogue with an Afghani Jewish tale from an oral archive — the Great Tradi- 
tion imbricated with the so-called "Little Tradition." So too, the philosopher-legalist 
Maimonides resonates with early modem mystic Hayyim ben Attar, and the Zohar with 
the author of Yiddish vernacular prayers, Shifra bas Joseph, wife of Ephraim Epstein. 
Rabbinic Judaism 2 , in these pages, speaks in many voices. 


Elliot K. Ginsburg is Associate Professor of Jewish Thought in the Department of Near Eastern 
Studies at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He is the author of The Sabbath in the Classical 
Kabbalah and translator (with a critical commentary) of Sod ha-Shabbat: The Mystery of the Sabbath 
by Rabbi Meir ibn Gabbai.

xxxvi FOREWORD 


If the Biblical-Rabbinic arc has a certain pride of place here, the book stretches to en- 
compass non-Rabbanite currents as well. These include (1) Jewish streams that dried up 
in late antiquity or which subsequently flowed into other traditions; and (2) other mythic 
currents that left only the faintest residue in the Hebrew Bible, but which re-emerged 
with singular potency later. Of the former case, think of Philo or various Apocryphal 
works, preserved largely in Christianity; of the latter, those submerged texts, think of 
ancient Mesopotamian myths of cosmic battle, of the personified waters of chaos or the 
Great Sea-Dragon battling YHWH — accounts that are virtually effaced in the Hebrew 
Bible, but which surface fullblown in the Babylonian talmudic setting. 3 Schwartz also 
visits the contested borderlands of Rabbinic Judaism, on occasion citing Karaite teach- 
ings or the Sabbatean-tinged Hemdat Yatnirn, a work which enjoyed currency in Sephardic 
and Hasidic circles, despite its suspect provenance. 

Finally, Schwartz expands the mythic canvas to include twentieth century figures, the 
Piasetzner Rebbe (d. 1943, Warsaw), Reb Zalman Shachter-Shalomi, the visionary of Jew- 
ish Renewal, and the Prague master Franz Kafka, to name three. All told, most of the 
dialects of Judaism, from major to minor, find a home here. Schwartz finds that elusive 
balance point between richness and focus. As one colleague put it: "Howard Schwartz is 
inclusive, but with good taste." 

For readers who may wonder whether this democratizing impulse edges towards ca- 
cophony — too much of a good thing — know that Schwartz's keen gifts as an editor carry 
the day. He gives his work a strong thematic center, organizing texts around ten mythic 
categories that unfold across time and space. He is able to structure and sequence sources, 
to fashion mythic cycles. He deftly places texts in alignment with each other, or in appo- 
sition/ opposition, creating a vibrant but coherent field of vision. What emerges therefore 
is an intriguing series of resonances and interrelations, a transhistorical Jewish mythology, if 
you will. If there are occasional bracing dissonances between myths, the whole approaches 
a symphony, a grand opus in ten chapters, ten movements. 

Not only are myths beautifully rendered here, but their meanings are variously eluci- 
dated, enriched and complexified through up-to-date scholarship. Schwartz appends a 
scholarly commentary to each myth. These mini-essays are models of concision and liter- 
ary insight. He traces motifs and provides historical context: explicating perplexities, 
highlighting discrete traditionary strands and points of evolution. Nor are spiritual in- 
sights lacking in these essays. Multiple readers will thus be astounded and delighted; for 
through Schwartz's tentacular reach our understanding of the Jewish and mythic imagi- 
nations is challenged and stretched. "This is Jewish?" some of us might be moved to ask. 
But Jewish it is! The sheer variety of mythemes found here supports Gershom Scholem's 
contention that one cannot predict a priori — on the basis of earlier teachings — just what 
will be considered authentically Jewish in any given period. 

The centrality of the mythic imagination. In recent decades scholars have called re- 
newed attention to the mythic element in successive strata of Jewish tradition 4 : to the 
mythic fragments, echoes and organizing themes found in the compositions of the He- 
brew Bible; to the rabbinic rereadings of the newly-canonical Scripture 5 in light of living 
myths of God's deeds and personality; and the complex integrations of mythic images 
and themes in medieval kabbalah, none more daring than the rendering of the divine 
totality in terms of ten potencies or sefirot, each with its own personality and gendered 
associations. (Divine oneness, for example, is expressed as the loving union of the mas- 
culine and feminine aspects of God.) In the ensuing paragraphs, I wish to suggest several 
things, knowing that their full articulation is beyond the scope of this essay: (1) that there 
is a Grand Myth (or meta-narrative) that was shared by most Jews in the Rabbinic, pre- 
modem setting; (2) that this grand myth is rooted in (if not identical with) the founda- 
tional text of the Hebrew Bible; (3) that in interpreting the Hebrew Bible, the Rabbis 



FOREWORD xxxvii 


developed a "Myth of myths" of signal importance, that of the multi-faceted Torah, whose 
manifold meanings could be successively uncovered but never exhausted; (4) that these 
three elements combined to support a sort of mythic consciousness enabling devotees to 
read their lives in terms of the Sacred Text and the Sacred Text in terms of their lives; and 
(5) that this mythic consciousness was rendered vital through storytelling and interpre- 
tation, as well as through the drama of ritual. 

Briefly then, (1) to be a Jew in the classical setting is to have a Story, a shared meta- 
narrative. It is to hold that this world is created as an act of divine will; that one is the heir 
of Abraham and Sarah; of those who endure(d) Egyptian slavery and the gifts of Re- 
demption, who stand at the pivot of Sinaitic revelation and its Covenant, who know the 
joys of homecoming and the enduring dislocations of exile. 6 It is to hold that there will be 
a Messianic resolution to history, though the Messiah doth tarry. This broad myth binds 
its adherents in a web of faith and fate, memory and expectation, in a way that transcends 
the defining particulars of time and place. This grand story (whose bare bones I tele- 
graph here) is rarely articulated in toto by its adherents: it is rather cited en passant , like 
one who hums a few bars of a well-known, deeply assimilated, song. The adherent car- 
ries this Story, or if you prefer, this Tune, but it also carries him or her. (2) The grid for this 
meta-Story is the foundational text, the Hebrew Bible, which reaches canonical status 
through its Rabbinic closure in the late first century. Yet (3) as one door is closed, another 
opens. As Gershom Scholem has eloquently shown, sacred Text was immediately re- 
opened through the medium of interpretation: midrash , commentary, and sundry forms 
of storytelling. Or as Michael Fishbane would have it: Rabbinic mythmaking "begins where 
the Hebrew Bible closes, with the canon." 7 What emerges is a suite (sometimes a tangle) of 
images, arguments, readings and narratives, all rooted in the evolving Myth of the Multi- 
Tiered Torah. This master narrative assumes that the divine Word is pregnant with mul- 
tiple meanings, whole families of mythemes. Thus we read "one God has spoken, two I 
have heard"; and the divine "word is fire," [its manifold meanings released] "like a ham- 
mer striking the Rock"; and in a particularly telling rabbinic litany, ellu ve-ellu divrei elohim 
hayyim: both this interpretation and that one (the one that contradicts it) are the word of the 
living God. 8 In its most lavish formulations — in mystical tradition — this becomes the Myth 
of Torah's infinite, inexhaustible meaning: "The Torah has seventy faces," nay "600,000 
facets." Or as various hasidic masters have it, not only do the black letters of text have 
meaning, but so too, the white spaces. 9 We might grasp this multiplicity by way of a par- 
able, which expresses its radical edge 10 : The great hasidic master Nachman ofBratslav has a 
dream within a dream . He wakes up from that inner dream. Still in visionary mode , he tries to 
interpret the inner dream, but its meaning eludes him. He sees a sage standing nearby , and asks him 
the meaning of his dream. The sage tugs at his beard and says: "this is my beard and This! [tugging 
again at the beard] is the meaning of your dream." 11 Nachman responds: "but I don't understand. 
"In that case" the sage adds, "go to the next room" Nachman repairs to the next room and finds an 
endless library filled with endless books. "And everywhere I looked ," he adds , "I found another com- 
ment on the meaning of this thing. " I ask, what is the deeper Truth: the transverbal immediacy 
of the tug, the Sage's " Thisl " or the infinite play of interpretation? Perhaps the Torah is 
never so clear as when it is being unpacked, mined for its manifold truths. And this con- 
cludes our Myth about the necessary multiplication of Myths. In a sense, Howard Schwartz's 
book is a more measured illustration of Nachman's creative play. 

(4) Arthur Green has written: "The great happenings of Scripture should in the proper 
sense be seen as mythical, that is, as paradigms that help us encounter, explain and en- 
rich by archaic association the deepest experiences of which we humans are capable... By 
retelling, grappling with, dramatizing, living in the light of these paradigms, devotees 
feel themselves touched by a transcendent presence that is made real in their lives through 
the retelling, the re-enactments." To use the formulation of Clifford Geertz, myth both 



xxxviii FOREWORD 


provides a model o/reality, what is really real, and a model for reality, how one is to behave 
in its light. 12 

There is a profound dialectic for those who live under the penumbra of the Sacred Text 
and its mythos: as devotees tend to read their life in terms of the orienting Text/Myth, 
and read the Text in terms of their life. Thus, some Jews during the Crusades saw them- 
selves as Father Abrahams called upon to sacrifice their children for the sake of their 
faith; even as the press of historical events and other (possibly Christian-influenced) nar- 
ratives may have led them to hold that the Biblical Isaac was actually sacrificed and 
resurrected. 13 Over time, given myths expand and contract. New glosses to extant myths 
emerge as mythic fragments or images; sometimes these images coalesce into new sto- 
ries, and sometimes into whole new mythic complexes or systems. Examples of System 
include the sefirotic theology in Zoharic Kabbalah with its Myth of the divine Androgyne, 
and the Lurianic mythos of Creation, Shattering, and Tikkun/Cosmic Restoration. 

Classically speaking, to be a Jew is to have access to — to assimilate/debate/relate — 
varying degrees of these extant fragments, stories, mythic cycles and mythologies. 

(5) As Howard Schwartz notes, myths are vitalized and absorbed not only through 
storytelling, but through the embodied mime of ritual performance (generally linked 
with the pattern of mitzvot and the cycles of sacred time). To grasp this, let me give one 
extended example — the myth of Sinaitic Revelation, wherein divine Presence and Will 
were simultaneously disclosed. 14 On one level, this was seen as a unique event that cre- 
ated a singular pivot in history. "God spoke these words ve-lo yasaf, and did not add any 
more." (Deut. 5:19) After this event, all has changed, and nothing can match its water- 
shed import. To recall Sinai is to acknowledge that one-time transformation, and to live 
in light of its teachings. 

On the second level of mythic enactment, Sinai is seen as an event that is periodically 
reactualizable. For example, to study Torah is (in the Rabbinic context) to bask in the light 
of Sacred Time and its heroes. To read and interpret, to retell, is to move from being a 
dzstemporary of the Biblical figures to becoming their (near) contemporaries. 15 In a stron- 
ger sense, perhaps, to celebrate the holiday of Shavuot is to stand again at Sinai. In its 
kabbalistic formulation, especially, it is to enter the Covenant/Marriage with the Holy 
One, to feel the embrace of divine intimacy — not as memory of things past but as some- 
thing wholly immediate. Here the sacred past flows into the present, or perhaps better: 
one re-enters that "past" which is not truly past so much as a transhistorical moment that 
is an eternal "present." 

On the third level of signification, again found most strongly in kabbalistic tradition, 
Sinai is a paradigm for that which is, at bottom, always occuring. Here one comes to realize 
that the revelations of Shavuot are always present, if one could only maintain expanded 
awareness. Drawing on the Rabbinic pun "[At Sinai] God spoke these words, ve-lo yasaf: 
and did not add any more [i.e., Revelation is over] ff. Deut. 5:19, they read: ve-lo yasaf: and 
never ceased speaking. 16 The Torah that had been summarily closed is thus reopened, its 
wellsprings unsealed: ma'ayan nove’a. As Nachmanides had it, from the large miracles (such 
as Revelation at Sinai) one comes to the sense of the small epiphanies. For divinity is al- 
ways present and the Voice never ceases to flow. At this level of expanded awareness [mohin 
de-gadlut] God is, as the benediction has it, noten ha-torah, the one who ever gives Torah, 
each moment anew. 17 At various points in his book Schwartz illumines the connection be- 
tween myth and ritual, showing how story can become, in his words, "more than story." 

To date, we have implied that it was through myth that Israel most commonly encoun- 
tered, grappled with, assimilated and marked life's pivotal moments. For myth addresses 
some of our fundamental existential questions, concerns that may shift over time but 
which tend to pervade different cultural settings. These questions include: how did the 
world come into being, and to what end; what may I/we hope for; what is the meaning 



FOREWORD xxxix 


of suffering and of joy, the co-existence of good and evil; is there a deeper purpose to 
history? What does it mean to be a Jew, to embrace Jewish practice? Who (rarely what) is 
God and how may I serve the One? what does it mean to be both an image of the divine 
and "dust and ashes"; what does it mean that I can both shatter and fix vessels and 
worlds? What is the meaning of gender — in humanity, in divinity? Or: what is the rela- 
tion of work and rest, of depression and renewal? What is the significance of embodi- 
ment and ensoulment? And: what might unfold in other dimensions of existence, both 
high and low; to wit, what is the meaning of death, its sorrows and its sweet release, and 
how does one here live in its presence? In this foreword I simply pose the questions. In 
Tree of Souls these and other root questions are vividly addressed. It has been said that 
survival (and the production of meaning) comes in cultural inflections. The myths in this 
book give voice to a full array of Jewish inflections and dialects, creating olam u-melo'o, "a 
world replete with meanings". 

Still each path has its pitfalls. It is to Howard Schwartz's credit that his embrace of the 
mythic model does not blind him to the significant counter-impulses within Judaism: the 
various Rabbinic and philosophical critiques of certain myths, especially the graphic 
mythicizations of God found in aggadah and some strands of kabbalah. Second, even as 
Schwartz is aware of the profundities in his mythic sources, he is aware of their dangers 
too. For myths both articulate and absolutize (reify) our deepest visions. For an example 
see the Introduction, where Schwartz poignantly notes: "The intractable conflict in the 
Middle East between Israel and the Palestinians derives from this belief in the sanctity of 
the Holy Land, especially of Jerusalem, shared by both Jews and Muslims. This serves as 
a compelling reminder of the enduring and sometimes destructive power of these myths, 
which are not always benign." Or as James Young put it in a different context: a common 
site of memory is not necessarily a site of common memory. 18 

Ways of reading this book. As noted. Tree of Souls maintains a dynamic tension be- 
tween textual diversity and thematic focus through the centripetal force of its editor. 
Schwartz's frequent weaving together of parallel sources into a unitary myth is an im- 
pressive achievement. Still, I confess that I often have trouble with this approach since it 
smooths out the edges, obscures specific voices and historical settings. But thanks to the 
commentaries, I was rarely perturbed by this. And the gain in narrative flow was mea- 
surable. The author has done a remarkable job in presenting the chain midrashim and 
the longer legends/myths (the Tzohar 19 to restrict myself to one example.) I like the way 
Schwartz presented the hard unvarnished accounts found in some sources: the Zoharic 
text wherein the Holy One (masculine aspect of God) is mated not with Shekhinah as one 
would expect but with Lilith (the demonic realm in its feminine guise). Or the aggadah 
wherein the son of arch-demon Sammael is cannibalized by Eve (and Adam). This source 
was stunning in all senses of the term. In these and other texts, mind surprises heart, as 
the text reads in ways that run counter to expectations and hidden wishes. In still other 
texts, narrative reaches the status of mayse as defined by Abraham Joshua Heschel: a 
story in which heart surprises mind. 20 Nachman's fragmentary tale of "A Garment for 
the Moon" and the oral tale "The Cottage of Candles" are two such texts for me. Each 
reader will undoubtedly find his or her favorites: be they tales that edify or perplex, 
astonish or delight, be they myths that stick in the craw, force one to reconsider, or make 
the heart melt. For there are as many gates in this book as there are stories (and some 
would say, as there are readers). 

This book deserves a wide and varied audience. It will speak to storytellers of all 
stripes, spur the analogical and aesthetic imagination of artists. Students of myth and 
theology 0ewish and comparative) and spiritual seekers, those thirsty for the presence of 
the One, will have much to contemplate and absorb. Some readers may wish to focus on 
one tale at a time, to even memorize a passage or write it down and place it in pocket or 



xl FOREWORD 


purse for periodic examination and reflection. To learn by heart. Other readers may wish 
to explore a mythic cycle systematically, concordances in hand. Still others will want to 
make use of Schwartz's extensive notation of primary sources to engage in historical 
analysis. Through these notations and through the references to cutting-edge scholar- 
ship the reader is given tools to continue and deepen his or her readings. One need not 
agree with all of Schwartz's contentions in order to be edified and inspired by this book. 
He is a conversation partner of the highest order, a generous and deeply schooled bar- 
p'lugta. Still, not all is heavy in this book. As the midrash 21 has it panim tzohakot la-aggadah. 
"The Aggadah — the narrative imagination — has a laughing face." For reasons both play- 
ful and profound, this is a book to read and reread, to grow old with. 

The anthological imagination and its resonances. Tree of Souls is a latter-day exem- 
plar of the Jewish anthological imagination, that combinatory art. Indeed, anthology is 
one of the oldest forms of Jewish literary creativity, found in various Biblical books such 
as Psalms and, many would hold, the Pentateuch itself (if one accepts the documentary 
hypothesis). Many of the canonical and sacred works of the Rabbinic imagination were 
anthologies of texts, some even anthologies of anthologies . 22 In the modem period we 
have been blessed with encyclopedic anthologies of signal import, including Bialik and 
Ravnitzky's Sefer ha-Aggadah (in Hebrew) and Louis Ginzberg's magisterial Legends of the 
Jews. Tree of Souls builds on these works in many ways, recasting the thematic thrust of 
Sefer ha-Aggadah and revisioning the synthetic narrative of Ginzberg. Still, Schwartz ex- 
tends our scope by drawing on heretofore marginalized texts as well as post-medieval 
and modem texts not included in the earlier works . 23 Indeed, this book could only have 
been written at this historical moment. For it draws on works that had been lost to 
earlier generations, such as the piyyutim of Yannai and the Dead Sea Scrolls; oral narra- 
tives collected in recent decades; women's prayers that have just now re-entered public 
(and scholarly) purview; as well as mystical manuscripts and "minor" midrashim that 
were previously known only to yehidei segullah, the precious few. In this book, our collec- 
tive memory is dusted off, expanded and vitalized. 

By way of conclusion or as entree into the book itself, a parable about this volume and 
the Anthological Imagination. The word anthology etymologically implies a collection of 
flowers, the artful forming of a bouquet. The hasidic rebbe Nachman of Bratslav, himself a 
great mythopoet and storyteller, likened the act of prayer to this anthological art— the as- 
sembling of bouquets for the Holy One. Each letter, he teaches, is like a flower of the field, 
and from these letters one forms words, themselves bouquets. From these words one forms 
prayers, and from individual prayers, whole services of worship — elaborate bouquets, gar- 
lands of blessing. Nachman then explains that each word — each flower — has a special reso- 
nance, an inner music. Its music hangs in the air, combining and harmonizing with the 
other words and prayers that follow, in a kind of Deep Song. Nachman concludes: "When 
you rise and speak tire final words of the service, let the first letter of the first word still 
reverberate ." 24 The book in your hands is a work of enormous resonance. The careful reader 
of Tree of Souls cannot but marvel at the consistent power, the occasional bracing oddness, 
and the enduring beauty of this anthology. It is a testament to its power that many of the 
early stories resonate with later ones, and that one continues to hear something of this 
book's "inner music" — its soul-stirring niggun — long after one has closed its pages.

Yehuda Liebes' two volumes for SUNY Press, Arthur Green's Keter (Princeton, 1997), and the two 
issues of the Journal of Jewish Philosophy and Thought devoted to myth and ritual, vol. 6:1-2 (1997). 
The Hebrew reader might also consider Ha-Mitos be-Yahadut [Myths in Judaism], edited by Moshe 
Idel and Ithamar Gruenwald (Jerusalem: Z. Shazar, 2004). Broadly speaking, most Judaic scholars 
through the 1970's tended to define myth narrowly and negatively, linking it with so-called "pa- 
gan" religions. They therefore tended to see Judaism as a demythologizing tradition, broken only 
by the "mythic resurgence" of kabbalah. Most recent scholars understand myth more broadly, as 
a fundamental human impulse (found in virtually all cultures) to structure life around orienting 
Stories. These scholars find rich myths in all strata of Judaism: not only in kabbalistic ritual but in 
Biblical imagery and Rabbinic aggadah. They extend the mythic arc to contemporary Judaism, to 
the Zionist marking of "wilderness as mythic space" to give one potent example. My fundamen- 
tal sympathies, and those of Howard Schwartz, clearly lie with these "myth-friendly" scholars. 
For a spirited debate over the place of myth in Judaism, see Yehuda Liebes' and Shalom Rosenberg's 
pieces in Mada'ei ha-Yahadut 39 (1998). For two now-classic studies of the Jewish mythic imagina- 
tion (especially in mystical tradition) see Gershom Scholem's On the Kabbalah and its Symbolism 
(NY: Schocken, 1965) and On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead (ibid., 1991). Finally, for the ways in 
which diverse cultures make use of their central stories, see Wendy Doniger's splendid Other 
People's Myths: The Cave of Echoes (NY: Macmillan, 1988). 

5 Canonization led to the possibility of grasping Scripture all at once, as a totality, in an almost 
holographic fashion. In rabbinic midrash, for example, one could read a given verse intertextually: 
in light of a pasuk rahok, a verse taken from a wholly different literary context with which, how- 
ever, ingenious associations could be made. 

6 The slippage from past tense to present tense here is intentional, exemplifying the mythic 
tendency to collapse orders of time, i.e., to blur the distinctions between then and now.

8 This is not to say that everyone is equally empowered to interpret; rather, it is the religious 
virtuosi, the Rabbis, who assume that central role. Clearly, Howard Schwartz goes beyond the 
traditional Rabbinic models of authority in this book. On the three quotations cited here, see Ps. 
62:12, quoted in sundry rabbinic sources; the rendering of Jer. 23:29 in TB Sanhedrin 34a; and TB

meaning. But that matter lies beyond the scope of this essay! 

12 Of course, there are exceptions to this model. Gods and heroes can act in ways in which 
ordinary folks cannot. Thus, King David's sexual behavior is not simply valorized; and Moses is 
variously seen as exemplary (a model that can be asymptotically approached by the spiritual 
virtuoso) and exceptional, the figure who is sui generis and cannot be emulated. The Arthur Green

comes from his The Interpretation of Cultures (NY: Basic Books, 1973). 

13 The genius of our last reading, from a midrashic standpoint, is that it was able to be justified 
scripturally. The ram, Gen. 22:13 relates, was offered tahat b'no, in place of Isaac. But by choosing 
a secondary meaning of tahat, the interpreter astonishingly reads: after Isaac! The classical discus- 
sion of the Binding, as well as its midrashic, textual anchorings, can be found in Shalom Spiegel's 
The Last Trial (Woodstock, VT: Jewish Lights reprint, 1993).

INTRODUCTION 


I. The Mythical Strata of Judaism 

Is there a Jewish mythology? At first glance, it might not seem to exist. After all, the 
central principle of Judaism is monotheism — belief in one God, excluding the very possi- 
bility of other gods. How can there be a mythology where there is only one God, without 
any interaction between gods, one of the hallmarks of mythology? Mythology seems to 
imply a multiplicity of supernatural forces, which gives the story of divinity a tension 
and an excitement it does not have when there is only an all-powerful single Deity. And 
since, in the monotheistic view, God created the world out of nothing, ex nihilo , doesn't 
this imply that God is the only inhabitant of heaven? Otherwise it could be said that 
other deities or divine beings participated in the Creation or have a share in ruling the 
world. 

With only one God, heaven would be a barren place, at least in mythic terms. Yet the 
actual Jewish view of heaven is quite different. There are seven heavens, filled with an- 
gels and other divine beings, such as the Messiah, who is said to have a palace of his own 
in the highest heaven. The celestial Temple can be found there — the mirror image of the 
Temple in the earthly Jerusalem — as well as an abundance of heavenly palaces, one for 
each of the patriarchs and matriarchs and sages, where he or she teaches Torah to the 
attentive souls of the righteous and the angels. (Yes — in Jewish mythology women teach 
Torah in the world to come, although they were not traditionally permitted to do so in 
this world. 1 ) Above all, heaven is the home of the souls of the righteous, who ascend to 
Paradise after they take leave of this world. 

This vision of heaven ruled by God but populated by lesser divine beings and righ- 
teous souls may not seem to infringe on the core concept of monotheism. But among the 
inhabitants of heaven is an unexpected figure: God's Bride. This divine figure is known 
as the Shekhinah . At first this term referred to God's presence in this world, what is known 
as the Divine Presence. But by the thirteenth century, the term " Shekhinah ," which is femi- 
nine in gender, had come to mean "Bride of God" and the Shekhinah was openly identi- 
fied as God's spouse in the Zohar, the central text of Jewish mysticism . 2 This is a major 
development in terms of Jewish mythology, as the very notion of such a divine Bride is 
the essence of myth, echoing such pairs as Zeus and Hera in Greek mythology, and El 
and Asherah in the Canaanite. But the existence of such a figure, strongly resembling a 
Hebrew goddess, echoing the role attributed by some to Asherah in ancient Israel, raises 
the most elementary questions about her role in a monotheistic system . 3

xliv INTRODUCTION 


There are other unexpected echoes of polytheistic mythology to be found in Judaism. 
Genesis Rabbah, an important rabbinic text dating from the fourth or fifth century, speaks of 
a Council of Souls, apparently a council of heavenly deities, whom God consults with about 
the creation of the world and the creation of man. Here there is not one other divine figure, 
but multiple ones such as those found in pagan religions. Indeed, the Council of Souls is 
exactly like the divine council, led by the god El, who rules the world in Canaanite mythol- 
ogy. Such divine counsels rule in Mesopotamian and Babylonian mythologies as well . 4 

How could such a myth about multiple divinities be found in a mainstream rabbinic 
text such as Genesis Rabbah ? Why was it not rejected as blasphemous? The answer is that 
Judaism is not, and never has been, a single stream of thought, but a river formed of 
many, often contradictory, streams, and rabbinic texts are composites of different kinds 
of thinking. There has been a perennial struggle in Judaism between the antimythic, mono- 
theistic forces, and the kind of mythic forces that are prevalent in many kabbalistic texts. 
Therefore, in many mainstream rabbinic texts, including the Talmud and the Midrash, it 
is quite possible to find dualistic or even polytheistic configurations, such as this one 
about a Council of Souls, side by side with monotheistic texts. 

Just as there are a variety of mythologies — every people of the world has one — there 
are many definitions of mythology. At this point it might be appropriate to provide a 
definition for the approach to mythology used in this book: Myth refers to a people's sacred 
stories about origins, deities, ancestors, and heroes. Within a culture, myths serve as the divine 
charter, and myth and ritual are inextricably bound . 5 

Let us consider this definition in terms of Jewish tradition: myth refers to a people's 
sacred stories about origins, deities, ancestors, and heroes. This is precisely what the Torah 
recounts for the Jewish people — stories about origins, as found in Genesis; about God, the 
ruling deity; about ancestors such as Abraham and Moses, and heroes such as King David. 

As for having a divine charter, this is the precise nature of the Torah, dictated by God 
to Moses at Mount Sinai, which serves both as a chronicle and covenant. At the same 
time, myth and ritual reinforce each other in Judaism. The Sabbath alludes to the day of 
rest that God declared after six days of Creation. The ritual of the Sabbath is a constant 
reminder of the mythical origins of this sacred day. 

All of these primary aspects of mythology find expression in Jewish tradition, and 
individual myths have exercised great power over Jewish life. Even to this day Jews 
relive the Exodus at Passover, which recalls the escape from Egyptian bondage, and re- 
ceive the Torah anew on Shavuot, which commemorates the giving of the Torah. Nor, in 
some Orthodox Jewish circles, has the longing for the Messiah subsided. 

For those who prefer not to use the term "mythology" in relationship to Judaism, 
there are two primary objections. The first is that the term suggests a constellation of 
gods rather than a single, omnipotent God. How could there be a Jewish mythology 
without contradicting this basic tenet of Jewish theology, without undermining mono- 
theism? The simple fact is that despite being a monotheistic religion, like Christianity 
and Islam, Judaism does have real myth. Just as supernatural practices, such as using 
divination or consulting a soothsayer, were commonly performed despite the biblical 
injunction against them , 6 an extensive Jewish mythology did evolve, especially in mysti- 
cal circles, where it was believed possible to preserve a monotheistic perspective while 
simultaneously employing a mythological one. Here it was understood that most mytho- 
logical figures, especially the Shekhinah, were ultimately aspects of the Godhead, despite 
their apparent mythological independence. Indeed, it sometimes seems as if all of Jewish 
myth (and perhaps all of existence) were the epic fantasy of one Divine Being, or, as 
Lurianic kabbalah suggests, a kind of divine illusion, similar to the Hindu concept of 
maya. For what sometimes appears to have mythic independence can also be under- 
stood as an emanation of the Godhead. Divine emanations take the form of the ten sefirot, 



INTRODUCTION xlv 


as symbolized by the kabbalistic Tree of Life . 7 It is possible to identify a sefirotic process 
underlying virtually every myth. But in translating mythic imaginings into stages of 
emanation, the sefirot also serve as an antidote to mythology, as they are entirely con- 
veyed through allegory and symbolism, which are clearly not intended to be taken liter- 
ally, and may have been created to restrain the unbridled mythic impulse released in 
Jewish mysticism, as well as to define its underlying archetypal structure. Certainly, this 
system of divine emanations is as complex and comprehensive as that of the Jungian 
theory of archetypes. And while the essence of myth is archetype, it is much harder, if not 
impossible, to mythologize a system as abstract as the sefirot. Yet underlying these ab- 
stractions are the living forces of myth. 

The second objection to the use of "mythology" in terms of Jewish tradition is that it 
suggests that the beliefs under consideration are not true. Even the mere identification of 
a culture's beliefs as mythological indicates that it is being viewed from the outside rather 
than from the perspective of a believer. That is why, with a few exceptions, there has been 
such great reluctance to identify any of the biblical narratives as myths or to bring the 
tools of mythological inquiry to bear on Judaism or Christianity. While it is true that the 
study of these religions from a mythological perspective does imply the distance of criti- 
cal inquiry, it does not mean that the traditions being examined are therefore false. Mytho- 
logical studies are now commonly linked with psychological ones, and scholars such as 
C. G. Jung, Joseph Campbell, Mircea Eliade, Erich Neumann, Marie Louise Von Franz, 
and Sigmund Hurwitz have demonstrated how it is possible to recognize a dimension of 
psychological truths underlying mythic traditions, where myth can be seen as the collec- 
tive projection of a people. And not only psychological truths, but the deepest existential 
truths. Indeed, this is the reason that myths persist, because the questions they raise are 
perennial. In the case of Judaism, many generations of rabbis, as well as other Jews, re- 
ceived and transmitted the sacred myths, rituals, and traditions, sometimes radically 
transforming them in the process, as well as imparting their own human imprint. 

Over time, as the number of supernatural figures in this pantheon increased and inter- 
acted, an abundance of mythological narratives emerged. These stories describe events 
such as the transformation of Enoch into the angel Metatron, the Giving of the Torah, the 
separation of God's Bride from Her Spouse, the chain of events that has so far prevented 
the coming of the Messiah, and the attempts of Satan to gain inroads into the world of 
human beings. They also map out the realms of heaven and hell in great detail. By a 
process of accretion, these mythic realms were embellished and further defined, giving 
birth to additional narratives. In this way Jewish mythology has evolved into an exten- 
sive, interconnected — and often contradictory — mythic tradition. 


II. The Categories of Jewish Mythology 

Drawing on the full range of Jewish sources, sacred and nonsacred, ten major categories 
of Jewish mythology can be identified: Myths of God, Myths of Creation, Myths of Heaven, 
Myths of Hell, Myths of the Holy Word, Myths of the Holy Time, Myths of the Holy People, 
Myths of the Holy Land, Myths of Exile, and Myths of the Messiah. Each of these categories 
explores a mythic realm, and, in the process, reimagines it. This is the secret to the trans- 
formations that characterize Jewish mythology. Building on a strong foundation of bibli- 
cal myth, each generation has embellished the earlier myths, while, at the same time, 
reinterpreting them for its own time. 

Each of these ten major myths is represented here with several dozen submyths. These 
often form themselves into cycles, such as that of Enoch's heavenly ascent, or of Lilith's 
rebellion, or of Jacob's elevation to the status of a divine figure. A passage in a late medieval 



xlvi INTRODUCTION 


midrashic text seems to confirm this organizational approach, attributing this tenfold struc- 
ture to God: 8 "Ten things were paramount in the thought of God at the time of the Creation: 
Jerusalem, the souls of the patriarchs, the ways of the righteous, Gehenna, the Flood, the 
stone tablets, the Sabbath, the Temple, the Ark, and the light of the World to Come." 9 

This midrash suggests its own definition of mythology: that which is foremost in the 
mind of God. By keeping these things in mind, God permits them to exist, for whatever 
God visualizes comes to pass. Indeed, all of existence depends on God's willingness to let 
the world continue to exist. There are many variations on this theme. There also are myths 
to be found about prior worlds that God created and then destroyed, and some myths of an 
angry or dejected God who calls the continued existence of this world into question. 10 

The fact that there are ten things in God's mind is significant. Why the number ten? 
Primarily because of the Ten Commandments. Just as men must keep the Ten Command- 
ments in mind at all times, so too does God keep these ten things foremost in His mind. 
These are, in effect, God's Ten Commandments. Later the number ten also became at- 
tached to the Ten Lost Tribes, as well as the ten sefirot. An overview of each of these ten 
categories follows. 

1. Myths of God 

Judaism is primarily a religion based on the covenant between God and the people of 
Israel. According to the Torah, God established this covenant beginning with Abraham, 
and renewed it with Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and Moses. In the Jewish view, this covenant 
was formalized in the handing down of the Torah at Mount Sinai, and, ever since, the 
Jewish people have turned to the Torah to guide their lives. 

Naturally, there has been a powerful impulse in Judaism to better understand the na- 
ture of the God who created the world and established a covenant with the Jewish people. 
Among early Jewish mystics, this led to a series of visionary accounts, known as the 
Hekhalot texts, 11 that describe journeys of some famous rabbis into Paradise for the ex- 
plicit purpose of attaining greater knowledge of God. These journeys are very danger- 
ous, as there are said to be guards at every one of the seven levels of heaven, and the 
guard at the sixth gate will not hesitate to cut off the head of one who does not know the 
secret name that serves as a password to these celestial realms. 

Thus every aspect of God was open to mythic speculation: God's size and appearance; 
what God does during the day and at night; what God's voice was like to those who heard 
it at Mount Sinai; what God's relationship is like with His Bride; how God prays; how God 
grieved over the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem — despite the fact that He permit- 
ted that destruction to take place. Nor is God's relationship with Israel as onesided as one 
might expect: there is even a talmudic myth about the rabbis rejecting God's interpretation 
of the Law in favor of their own, after which God is said to have laughed and exclaimed, 
"My children have overruled Me!" 12 This kind of interaction between God and His people, 
Israel, makes it clear that, as Yehuda Liebes puts it, "The God of Israel is a mythic god, and 
as such maintains relationships of love and hate with His creatures." 13 

In some of these myths God not only suffers like his people, but sometimes shows 
remarkable tenderness. One myth describes God as sitting in a circle with many baby 
spirits that are about to be bom. 14 Another says that in the messianic era God will seat 
each person between His knees, and embrace him and kiss him and bring him to life in 
the World to Come. 15 Still another describes a nurturing God who raises the male chil- 
dren of the Israelites after they were abandoned because of Pharaoh's decree against 
newborn boys. After they were grown, they returned to their families. When they were 
asked who took care of them, they said, "A handsome young man took care of all our 
needs." And when the Israelites came to the Red Sea, those children were there, and 
when they saw God at the sea, they said to their parents, "That is the one who took care 
of us when we were in Egypt." 16 



INTRODUCTION xlvii 


Even though the second commandment clearly states that You shall not make for yourself 
. . . any likeness of what is in the heavens above (Exod. 20:4), rabbinic literature is full of anthro- 
pomorphic imagery of God, of God's hands, God's eyes and ears, God walking, sitting, 
and speaking. These images are often accompanied by a disclaimer, kivyakhol, "as if it were 
possible." 17 However, this disclaimer does not eliminate the distinct impression that God 
can be described in human terms. As Henry Slonimsky puts it: "Nowhere indeed has a 
God been rendered so utterly human, been taken so closely to man's bosom and, in the 
embrace, so thoroughly changed into an elder brother, a slightly older father, as here in the 
Midrash. The anthropomorphic tendency here achieves its climax. God has not merely 
become a man, he has become a Jew, an elderly, bearded Jew." 18 Or, as Midrash Tehillim on 
Psalm 118:5 states: "He is your father, your brother, your kinsman." 

The rabbinic commentators had to contend with the often contradictory descriptions 
of God's appearance. For example, God is said to have appeared as an old man at Mount 
Sinai, while He is described as a mighty warrior at the Red Sea. In commenting on the 
second commandment, I am Yahweh, your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out 
of the house of bondage (Exod. 20:2), 19 Rashi engages this issue by quoting God as saying, 
"Since I change in My appearance to the people, do not say that there are two divine 
beings, for it is I alone who brought you out of Egypt and it is I who was at the Red Sea." 

At the opposite end of the spectrum is the kabbalistic portrayal of God as Ein Sof, the 
I nfini te One, from whom emanated the ten stages of divine manifestation known as the ten 
sefirot. Each of these sefirot bear s one of God 's p rimary a ttributes, and tog ether they form 
t he realm o^ GocTs m anifestation in this world. Here, in contrast to a highly personified 
view of God, is one that is entirely impersonal, although the sefirot do represent attributes 
that are identified with human qualities, such as understanding, wisdom, judgment, and 
lovingkindness. 20 While one kabbalistic school identifies the true God as Ein Sof which is 
beyond the realm of the sefirot, another school asserts that the divine essence of God can be 
found in the ten sefirot, for they are identical with the Godhead, and should be viewed as 
stages in the hidden life of God. 21 The theory of the sefirot was not without its enemies. One 
of these, Rabbi Isaac ben Sheshet Parfat, known as Ribash, writing in the fourteenth cen- 
tury, quotes one critic as saying contemptuously about the kabbalists, "The idolaters be- 
lieve in the Trinity and the kabbalists believe in a tenfold God!" 22 

In the myths discussed so far, God has been portrayed as a masculine divinity. This is 
how most people view God. Yet no discussion of Jewish myths about God would be com- 
plete without a discussion of the myths about the Bride of God. This divine figure is known 
as the Shekhinah . Perhaps no Jewish myth undergoes as radical a transformation as does 
that of the Shekhinah. There is a complete cycle of Shekhinah myths to be found, which be- 
gins with God's creation of the Shekhinah , and portrays the sacred couplings of the divine 
pair as well as their confrontations and separations. In this view, the Shekhinah chose to go 
into exile with Her children, the children of Israel, at the time of the destruction of the 
Temple. When will Her exile come to an end? When the Temple, the Shekhinah's home in 
this world, is rebuilt at the time of the coming of the Messiah. There is even a rather stag- 
gering myth in the Zohar that suggests that the evil Lilith has supplanted God's true Bride 
in the divine realm. 23 These myths also reveal the existence of two Shekhinahs, one who 
makes Her home in heaven and one who has descended to earth. This cycle makes it clear 
that the kinds of interactions expected of a divine couple, like those found in Greek and 
Canaanite mythology — and to some extent in the Gnostic mythology of the early centuries 
of the Christian era — are found as well in the kabbalistic myths of God and His Bride. 24 
However, unique to Jewish myths — to kabbalistic myths in particular — is the implication 
that the two mythic beings, God and His Bride, are really two aspects of the same divine 
being, of a God who contains everything, including male and female qualities. Indeed, this 
is stated directly by the Rabbi Menahem Nahum of Chernobyl: "Only the Shekhinah and 
God together form a unity, for one without the other cannot be called a whole." 25 



xlviii INTRODUCTION 


In its earliest usage in the Talmud, " Shekhinah " refers to God's Divine Presence, thus 
the immanence or indwelling of God in this world. This personification was linked, in 
particular, to the sense of holiness experienced on the Sabbath. At this time no attempt 
was made to suggest that the Shekhinah was in any way independent of God, or to imply 
that the term referred to a feminine aspect of the Deity. Instead, the term implied the 
nearness of God, as in this homily of Rabbi Akiba: "When a man and wife are worthy, the 
Shekhinah dwells in their midst; if they are unworthy, fire consumes them ." 26 

Yet some rabbinic myths set the stage for the ultimate transformation of the Shekhinah 
into an independent being. At first this usage of the term Shekhinah was intended to af- 
firm that God remained true to the children of Israel and accompanied them wherever 
they went. In time, however, the term Shekhinah came to be identified with the feminine 
aspect of God and came to acquire mythic independence. Myths that emerge in kabbalistic 
and hasidic literature portray the Shekhinah as the Bride of God and the Sabbath Queen, 
personifying Her as an independent mythic figure. Indeed, there are several other iden- 
tities linked to the Shekhinah, who is sometimes also portrayed as a princess, a bride, an 
old woman in mourning, a dove, a lily, a rose, a hind, a jewel, a well, the earth, and the 
moon . 27 These multiple facets of the Shekhinah suggest that as a mythic figure, the Shekhinah 
has absorbed a wide range of feminine roles. There is a series of myths about the Shekhinah 
found in the Zohar, forming a cycle . 28 Some of these myths are undeniably erotic in de- 
scribing the lovemaking of God and the Shekhinah. Part of this cycle also includes the 
greatest conflict between God and His Bride, over God's permitting the Temple in Jerusa- 
lem, the home of the Shekhinah, to be destroyed. This results in the Shekhinah separating 
from God and going into exile with Her children, the children of Israel. It is here that the 
Shekhinah achieves mythic independence, for it is evident that the confrontation takes 
place between two mythic figures. After this, the presence of the Shekhinah is fully in- 
jected into the tradition. It prepares the way for a series of visions and encounters with 
the Shekhinah that are associated, in particular, with the Kotel ha-Ma'aravi, the Western 
Wall of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, also known as the Wailing Wall. 

In these kabbalistic and post-kabbalistic texts, it is apparent that, at least from a mytho- 
logical point of view, the Shekhinah has become an independent entity. Nevertheless, the 
Shekhinah was regarded at the same time as an extension or aspect of the Divinity, which 
was, of course, necessary in order to uphold the essential concept of monotheism. True 
initiates of the kabbalah were not disturbed by these apparent contradictions, but, for 
others, the danger of viewing the Shekhinah as a separate deity was recognized. That 
explains why the study of the kabbalistic texts was not permitted until a man had reached 
his fortieth year . 29 Only such a person was felt to be grounded enough not to be over- 
whelmed by kabbalistic mysteries, while younger, more vulnerable men might well be 
led astray. 

Nor does the evolution of the myth of the Shekhinah end with the role portrayed in the 
Zohar in the thirteenth century. The implications of the exile of the Shekhinah were ex- 
panded in the sixteenth century by Rabbi Isaac Luria in his myth of the Shattering of the 
Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks. And in the nineteenth century Rabbi Nachman 
of Bratslav told the allegorical tale of "The Lost Princess," which hints at an identification 
of the Shekhinah with an internal feminine figure, much like Jung's concept of the anima . 30 

One other subtle identity of the Shekhinah is suggested in the talmudic tradition of 
every Jew receiving a neshamah yeterah, a second soul, on the Sabbath: "Rabbi Shimon ben 
Lakish said: 'On the eve of the Sabbath the Holy One, blessed be He, gives man an extra 
soul, and at the close of the Sabbath He withdraws itfrom him .'" 31 This second soul is the 
internal experience of the Shekhinah. It remains throughout the Sabbath, and is believed 
to depart after Havdalah, the ritual of separation performed at the end of the Sabbath. 
This second soul functions as a kind of ibbur, literally "an impregnation," in which the 



INTRODUCTION xlix 


spirit of a holy figure fuses with the soul of a living person, bringing greater faith and 
wisdom . 32 But in this case it is a divine soul that fuses with the souls of Jews on the 
Sabbath. It is not difficult to identify this second soul with the presence of the Shekhinah, 
who is also the Sabbath Queen. Certainly, the arrival and departure of the Sabbath Queen 
and the arrival and departure of this mysterious second soul are simultaneous. Identifying 
the second soul with the Shekhinah is a way of acknowledging the sacredness of the Sabbath 
from both within and without. For Rabbi Yitzhak Eizik Safrin of Komamo, a man could 
best discover the Shekhinah through his wife. He states in Notzer Hesed that the Shekhinah 
rests on a man mainly because of his wife, for a man receives spiritual illumination because 
he has a wife. He describes a man as being positioned between two wives. One, his earthly 
wife, receives from him, while the Shekhinah bestows blessings on him. 

Out of all of these meanings attributed to the Shekhinah emerge a cycle of myths linked 
to the Shekhinah. Some of these portray the unity of God and His Bride, while others are 
about their separation. The key myth, as noted, is that of the exile of the Shekhinah , for at 
the time the Bride goes into exile, the figure of the Shekhinah becomes largely indepen- 
dent of the Divinity and takes on a separate identity. Still, the question remains: can the 
Shekhinah be considered a goddess? Does Her independent status award Her equality? 
The answer is more difficult than it might seem. On the one hand, the nature of the evo- 
lution of the Shekhinah from the concept of God's presence in this world to the Bride of 
God seems to maintain the Shekhinah 1 s identity with God strongly enough to raise doubts 
about Her goddesslike role. But, on the other hand, the role of the Shekhinah that emerges 
in the kabbalistic era can be viewed as a resurrection of the role of the suppressed god- 
dess Asherah in ancient Jewish tradition . 33 Finally, the integral role of the Shekhinah in the 
system of the ten sefirot, where the Shekhinah is identified with the final sefirah of Malkhut, 
complicates the matter further. In the end, while the Shekhinah appears to have some of 
the earmarks of a goddess figure, this role is not as clear-cut as those of goddesses in 
other mythic traditions. Yes, the Shekhinah is the Bride of God, but, at the same time, the 
Shekhinah is a feminine aspect of the one God, and these roles exist simultaneously. How 
can this contradiction be resolved? Perhaps by viewing the mythological tradition within 
Judaism as a unique development, a kind of monotheistic mythology . 34 

Note that the myth of the exile of the Shekhinah is a two-part myth. In the first stage, 
the Bride of God goes into exile at the time of the destruction of the Temple, while in the 
second stage, a reunion of God and the Shekhinah takes place . 35 This reunion is brought 
about through the activities of Israel in fulfilling requirements of the mitzvot, the ritual 
requirements of the Law, and through the conscious application, or kawanah, of prayers. 
When this reunification becomes permanent, the exile of the Shekhinah will come to an 
end, and "the Shekhinah will return to Her husband and have intercourse with Him ." 36 
This development is linked to the coming of the Messiah, in that one of the consequences 
of the messianic era is that the Temple in Jerusalem, which was the Shekhinah* s home in 
this world, will be rebuilt. Since the Shekhinah went into exile because of its destruction, 
the rebuilding of the Temple will represent the end of Her exile. In this way the myths of 
the Shekhinah and the Messiah become linked. 

Contributing to the long life of Jewish myths such as that of the Shekhinah are several 
associated rituals. The most important ritual linked to the myth of the Shekhinah is that 
known as Kabbalat Shabbat , re-created by Rabbi Isaac Luria in the sixteenth century. Here 
the worshipers go out into the fields just before sunset on the eve of the Sabbath and 
welcome the Sabbath Queen. Luria found the basis for this ritual in the Talmud, in Rabbi 
Haninah's going out to greet the Sabbath Queen . 37 Of course, by the time Luria formal- 
ized this ritual, the concept of the Sabbath Queen had evolved into an independent mythic 
figure, and the ritual itself becomes a kind of goddess worship, but within Judaism. 



1 INTRODUCTION 


Most readers will also be surprised to learn that other divine beings are portrayed in 
the Jewish pantheon who assist God in ruling the heavens and the earth. The angel 
Metatron, for example, is not only described as the heavenly scribe, but is also said to 
rule over the angels and to see to it that God's decrees are carried out in heaven and on 
earth. These figures function in a way that is reminiscent of the Gnostic demiurge. But 
the demiurgic figures in Jewish tradition are chosen by God and remain subservient to 
Him, as in the case of Metatron, who is identified as the lesser Yahweh. Further, they lack 
the malignant overtones of the Gnostic demiurge Ialdabaoth, the demonic figure described 
in the Apocryphon of John. Nevertheless, Metatron and other Jewish demiurgic figures 
do function as divinities and share the duties of ruling the worlds above and below 
with God. 38 

While the primary myths about Metatron are found in the books of Enoch, reference to 
Metatron is even found in the Talmud, 39 where a commentary on the verse where God 
says to Moses, "Come up to the Lord" (Exod. 24:1), is interpreted to mean that Metatron, 
not God, called upon Moses: "A heretic said to Rabbi Idith: 'It is written. Then God said to 
Moses, "Come up to the Lord."' But surely it should have stated, 'Come up unto Me!' Rabbi 
Idith replied, 'It was Metatron who spoke to Moses, whose name is similar to that of his 
Master, for it is written. For my Name is in him (Exod. 23:21).' 'In that case,' the heretic 
retorted, 'we should worship him!"' 

This is a shocking discussion to be found in the Talmud, the most sacred Jewish text 
after the Bible, as it demonstrates that a near-divine role was attributed to Metatron even 
among some of the ancient rabbis. Thus even as Judaism was transformed from its bibli- 
cal model to the rabbinic model and later to kabbalistic and hasidic models, there were 
multiple versions of Judaism being practiced, those of the educated elite and those of the 
people. And even among the elite there were many sects, some emphasizing mystical 
teachings, such as the Mysteries of Creation and the meaning of Ezekiel's vision of God's 
Chariot, 40 others describing heavenly journeys; and still others focused on demiurgic 
figures like Enoch. In addition, there are also surprising enthronement myths about Adam, 
Jacob, Moses, King David, and the Messiah, in which each takes on a demiurge-like role. 41 
That is to say, they are chosen by God to assist in the ruling of the world. Some of these 
myths, such as those about Jacob, were likely inspired by biblical verses such as Jeremiah 
10:16: Not like these is the portion of Jacob; for it is He who formed all things, and Israel is His very 
own tribe: Lord of Hosts is His name. Although most of these enthronement myths are found 
in the Pseudepigrapha — the noncanonical teachings of Judaism — some of them, such as 
those about Metatron and Jacob, can be found in standard rabbinic sources. In any case, 
the existence of these enthronement myths demonstrates the existence of some Jewish 
sects whose views show evidence of being dualistic. 

Read together, these myths reveal a much more complex portrait of God than might be 
expected, especially of God's role in Creation and in ruling the world, and of God's special 
relationship with the people of Israel. They also reveal how generations of rabbis and mys- 
tics strove to discern God's plan in creating the world, and what those intentions revealed 
of God's true nature. At the same time, these myths show God in His appearance, in His 
daily activities, in His joys and sufferings, to be very much like His people. Indeed, the 
portrait of God that emerges is of a highly sympathetic figure, portrayed with the full range 
of emotions, dark as well as light, that characterize His human creations. 

2. Myths of Creation 

Many people believe there is one account of Creation in Judaism: the Genesis story of 
the seven days of Creation. Those familiar with biblical scholarship may recognize two 
creation myths. The first is Genesis l:l-2:3. The second begins at Genesis 2:4 with the 
words: Such is the story of heaven and earth when they were created. This creation myth in- 



INTRODUCTION li 


eludes the creation of the first man and woman, the myth of the Garden of Eden and the 
Fall, and ends at Genesis 3:24 with the expulsion of Adam and Eve: He drove the man out , 
and stationed east of the garden of Eden the cherubim and the fiery ever-turning sword , to guard 
the way to the Tree of Life. 

Those intimate with the Hebrew Bible will also have recognized allusions to other 
creation myths, such as the one summarized in Psalm 104:2 and 104:10 — You spread the 

heavens like a tent cloth He established the earth on its foundations , so that it shall never totter . 

Some readers may read these passages as a summary restatement of the Genesis account, 
while others will recognize an alternate creation myth, in which God first creates the 
heavens and then the earth. 

Another very ancient Jewish creation myth is based upon the Babylonian myth of the 
god Marduk, the sky god, trampling Tiamat, the primeval ocean and divine mother. This 
myth is alluded to in Isaiah 51:9, Was it not You who cut Rahab in pieces , and wounded the 
dragon? And the story is told in the Talmud 42 in a version that makes the parallel to the 
Babylonian myth explicit: " When God desired to create the world, he said to Rahab, the 
Angel of the Sea: 'Open your mouth and swallow all the waters of the world/ Rahab 
replied: 'Master of the Universe, I already have enough/ God then kicked Rahab with 
His foot and killed him. And had not the waters covered him no creature could have 
stood his foul odor." 

It is likely that these mythic fragments from Psalms and Isaiah were known by the 
priestly editors of Genesis, who chose the version of Creation found at the beginning of 
Genesis that portrays a creation out of spoken words rather than by the actions of God. 
This is the earliest expression of an impulse in Jewish mythology to present God's ac- 
tions in verbal rather than physical terms. 

Even informed readers may be surprised to learn that there are over 100 different creation 
myths in Judaism. Not only do these offer alternate scenarios about how God created the 
world, but some of them also raise the question of whether God created the world out of 
nothing (ex nihilo) or used existing elements. Some even question whether God was assisted 
in the Creation by others, and, if so, whether these were angels or other divine beings. 

What role did these variant creation myths play in Judaism? They addressed primary 
theological issues about the nature of God and the Mysteries of Creation that had impor- 
tant implications. For example, if, as stated in Isaiah 45:7: "I form light and create darkness ," 
does that mean that light pre-existed, and that God merely formed it, rather than created 
it out of nothing? If light did pre-exist, who created it, and does that imply that there are 
other divine beings? Is a God who shapes pre-existing elements as all-powerful as a God 
who creates them out of nothing? In De Somniis Philo identifies God as an artificer as well 
as a creator: "When God gave birth to all things. He not only brought them into sight, but 
also brought into being things that had not existed before. Thus He was not merely an 
artificer, but also a creator." 43 

It is readily seen that these are issues close to the heart of monotheism. But the prolif- 
eration of these myths strongly suggests that there were conflicting views among the 
various Jewish sects and even among the rabbis who were the authors of the talmudic 
and midrashic texts. The advent of kabbalah in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries gave 
a new direction and implication for creation myths. There is a creation myth near the 
beginning of the Zohar about how the world was created from a cosmic seed. 44 This is a 
far cry from the Genesis myth, suggesting that rather than creating the world through 
speech, God nourished a cosmic seed in a palace described in terms that strongly suggest 
a womb. Thus it emphasizes God's nurturing, feminine qualities. Indeed, one of the pri- 
mary purposes of kabbalah seems to be a renewal of the feminine in Judaism. 

What was the impact of these far-flung creation myths? In some cases it was profound. 
The myth created by Rabbi Isaac Luria, known as the Ari, about the Shattering of the 



lii INTRODUCTION 


Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks, transformed the way Jews viewed their lives in 
exile from the Holy Land. The Ari's myth gave their wanderings in exile a new meaning, 
in which God had put them in those far-flung places to gather holy sparks, in prepara- 
tion for the advent of the messianic era. 45 

Myths about the creation of the world are, naturally, the primary type of creation myths 
found in Judaism. However, there is another important type of creation myth, concern- 
ing the creation of human beings. Once again, the Genesis accounts of the creation of 
Adam and Eve serve as the basis for a remarkable permutation of such creation myths. 
Even Genesis itself contains what the rabbis identified as an alternate scenario, based on 
the verse Male and female He created them (Gen. 1:27). Since this was understood to de- 
scribe a simultaneous creation of man and woman, it seemed to conflict with the sequen- 
tial creation of Adam and Eve. This led the rabbis to conclude that Adam had a first wife, 
before Eve. This, in turn, initiated a rich cycle of legends about Adam's first wife, who is 
sometimes called the First Eve and sometimes identified as Lilith. 46 But that very same 
verse also was used as the basis of a myth that Adam and Eve were created back to back, 
and that God had to divide them in two and then create backs for each of them. 47 The 
Zohar draws its own conclusions about the pairing of male and female: "God shaped all 
things in the form of male and female. In another form things cannot exist." 48 

Indeed, a closer reading of these myths about the creation of Adam reveals two sepa- 
rate traditions, one about a heavenly Adam and one about an earthly one. A wide variety 
of sources, for example, recount myths about a heavenly Adam. The Hellenistic philoso- 
pher Philo called this figure "The Heavenly Man." 49 In his view, the heavenly man, bom 
in the pure image of God, is imperishable, and thus a divine figure. Some myths identify 
this figure as a heavenly Adam. There are also myths about Adam as a giant who reached 
the heavens, before he ate the forbidden fruit and shrank to human size. 50 Adam is also 
described as God's confidant, as the heavenly judge who separates the righteous from 
the sinners, and as a figure of such magnitude that the angels started to wonder if they 
should bow down before him. 51 Later this myth of a heavenly Adam evolved into the 
complex kabbalistic concept of Adam Kadmon, the primordial man, who is God's first 
creation, a kind of divine interface through whom all subsequent creation takes place. 

There are more creation myths in Judaism than any other kind. The Mysteries of Cre- 
ation served as a powerful attraction to the ancient Jews, and they were explored in depth 
at every phase of Jewish tradition. 

3. Myths of Heaven 

God makes His home in heaven. We leam of the existence of heaven in the very first 
verse of the Torah: In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth (Gen. 1:1). The He- 
brew term, shamayim, means both "skies" and "heavens," which suggests how the skies 
came to be identified as the heavens, and God as the first inhabitant of heaven. Yet even in 
the biblical account of heaven, God is described as sharing the heavenly realm with the 
angels. We leam this from the story of the Binding of Isaac: just when Abraham raised the 
knife above his son, Isaac, an angel of the Lord called to him from heaven (Gen. 22:11). The Bible 
also notes other angels, such as Michael, Gabriel, and the Angel of the Lord. 

What is missing in the biblical view of heaven are the souls of the righteous. It is not 
until the rabbinic period, beginning around the first century, that the biblical concept of 
heaven was expanded to include them. For the past 2,000 years heaven has been mapped 
out in great detail in rabbinic, kabbalistic, and hasidic texts, as well as in the texts of the 
Pseudepigrapha and Jewish folklore. And in all of them heaven includes a multitude of 
angels and other divine beings, as well as the souls of the righteous. 

There is an abundance of myths about heaven. These include myths that demarcate 
the map of the seven heavens and detail the celestial temple and the palaces and treasur- 
ies of heaven, as well as its fiery rivers and choirs. There are also myths about the interac- 



INTRODUCTION liii 


tion of heavenly beings who are similar to those found in Greek myth, except that angels 
play the roles Greek myth assigns to gods. The myths of heaven include several cycles, 
such as that about Enoch's ascent into Paradise and transformation into the angel Metatron. 
There are also a great many myths about the angels, not only about the well-known 
archangels Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, and Raphael, but also about some lesser known but 
very importanfangeTs, such as Lailah, the Angel of Conception; the angel Gallizur, who 
utters all of God's evil decrees for Him; and B'ree, the Angel of Rain. When angels, such 
as Elijah, are sent to this world as messengers, they are clothed in bodies formed from air 
or fire. In many myths, the angels demonstrate minds of their own and serve as a sound- 
ing board for God's important decisions, such as whether to make human beings. Note 
that while God consults the angels. He often ignores their counsel. 52 

Heaven serves as a multipurpose concept in Judaism. It is not only the home of God and 
the other inhabitants of heaven, but it is also the Olam ha-Ba, the world to come, where the 
souls of the righteous are said to go after they take leave of this world. Thus, for the living, 
heaven serves as a place of longing, and as a strong motivation for people to remain righ- 
teous in order to attain their heavenly reward. Finally, heaven serves as the destination for 
mystics among the rabbis who sought to journey there while still living, using amulets and 
spells. Their stories are recounted in detail in the Hekhalot texts. For all these reasons, there 
b an abundance of myths about heaven and its inhabitants. Read together, these myths 
reveal a well-developed mythology about heaven as God's home, as well as the home of 
God's Bride, and home to the angels, the Messiah, and the souls of the righteous. 

Note that the term for paradise is Gan Eden , literally, the Garden of Eden. This term has 
a double meaning, in that it is applied to both the earthly Garden of Eden and the heavenly 
one. The one on earth was the one that was inhabited by Adam and Eve. The other is the 
heavenly garden, which is a synonym of Paradise. As Nachmanides puts it, commenting 
on Genesis 3:23, "The physical things that exist on earth also exist in heaven. Likewise, the 
heavenly Gan Eden with its trees has a counterpart on earth." The earthly and the heavenly 
paradise are essentially separate but related mythic realms. Nevertheless, the imagery of 
one sometimes gets mixed with that of the other, as where streams of the kind that flow in 
the earthly garden are said to be found in heaven, flowing not with water, but with pre- 
cious balsam oil. 53 Thus we are to understand that heaven also has streams, just like those 
found on earth. This also finds expression in the mirror image of the earthly city of Jerusa- 
lem and the heavenly Jerusalem, and grows out of the principle "as above, so below." 

4. Myths of Hell 

In the biblical view, all the souls of the dead congregate in a grim place called Sheol. 
There is neither reward nor punishment. It is not unlike the Greek realm of Hades, and it 
likely influenced the Christian concept of Limbo. In rabbinic lore, Sheol was replaced by 
Gehenna, a place of punishment for the souls of sinners, which combines elements of 
both purgatory and hell. It was the widespread rabbinic belief that only a few souls went 
directly to Paradise after death. The majority went to Gehenna where they burned in the 
fires of hell and were punished with fiery lashes by avenging angels for up to one year. In 
the Zohar these fires of hell are identified as a person's own burning passions and desires, 
which consume him. 54 These punishments are just as severe as those portrayed in Dante's 
Inferno , but — in contrast to the Christian concept of hell — the purified souls are released 
from Gehenna and permitted to make a slow ascent into Paradise. For this reason it could 
be argued that Jewish hell is more like the Christian concept of purgatory than hell, and 
some take the position that the inevitable release from Gehenna means there is no Jewish 
concept of hell at all, but, instead, a stage of punishment that purifies the soul before it 
ascends on high. However, the descriptions of the punishments of Gehenna are so exten- 
sive, 55 and the fear of these punishments among the living was so widespread, that it 
seems more accurate to simply describe Gehenna as "Jewish hell." 



liv INTRODUCTION 


Many of the myths of Gehenna simply enumerate the punishments found there. Oth- 
ers attempt to map out the dimensions of Gehenna, and to point out where its entrances 
can be found. Over time, an elaborate mythology about Gehenna accrued, much as did 
the mythology about heaven. Many new details emerged, such as the role of Dumah, the 
angel in charge of Gehenna, or the presence of a guard outside Gehenna who only admits 
those for whom punishment has been decreed. Reports are found about visits to Gehenna 
by several great rabbis, as well as accounts about how all punishments in Gehenna cease 
during the Sabbath. 56 One learns that there is a whole category of avenging angels who 
deliver pufiishments to the sinners in Gehenna. These fearsome angels chase after the 
souls of newly deceased sinners with fiery rods, and when these angels catch the sinners, 
they drag them to Gehenna to face their punishments. 57 

Thus the role of the punishment of hell in Judaism is a transitional one, part of a larger 
myth about sin and redemption, in which virtually everyone's soul is eventually puri- 
fied enough to escape further punishment. In this it is in stark contrast to the Christian 
view that the punishments of hell are eternal. 58 

5. Myths of the Holy Word 

Judaism is a strongly text-oriented religion. Not only is the primary text, the Torah, 
studied, but so too are the extensive rabbinic commentaries about it. 59 Much of the power 
attributed to the alphabet and to language grows out of their importance in the Genesis 
account of Creation, where God's words brought the world into being. Equally impor- 
tant is the account of the Giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai, where amidst lightning and 
thunder God's voice rang out for all the people to hear. So manifest was the voice that All 
of the people saw the sounds (Exod. 20:15). One myth describes the impact of God's voice as 
so great that the souls of the people leapt from their bodies and they all dropped dead, 
and God had to revive them with the dew of life. 60 So too does God's primary Name, 
YHVH, known as the Tetragrammaton, have limitless power for the one sage in each 
generation who knows its true pronunciation. Thus the power of the word, both spoken 
and written, is undisputed in Judaism. ‘ ' ” ~ — 

Above all, the lorah itselt taxes on great mythological significance. It becomes far more 
than a text, even a text whose author is God. It comes to represent the full spectrum of 
Jewish teachings over the ages. The words of the Torah are believed to contain all truth, and 
in the rabbinic view it is even possible to interpret one word of the Torah as equivalent to 
another, as long as the numerical total of the two words is the same. 61 One myth describes 
the Torah as being written on the Arm of God. 62 Others personify the Torah as a bride, and 
Moses as her bridegroom. Still another myth describes the Torah as the wedding contract 
( ketubah ) between God and Israel, binding the two together in a complex covenant. 

There is even the idea that God is incarnated in the Torah. While most discussions 
about the Torah present it as God's creation and as the meeting place of human beings 
and God, the fourteenth century kabbalistic commentator Rabbi Menahem Recanati iden- 
tified God and the Torah as one and the same thing: "God is incomplete without the 
Torah. The Torah is not something outside Him, and He is not outside the Torah. Conse- 
quently, God is the Torah." 63 This statement is explicitly contradicted by the eighteenth 
century kabbalist Moshe Hayim Luzzatto: "The Torah is God's, but He is not His Torah. 
The Torah is not in itself God, not His essence, but rather His wisdom and His will." 64 

Another view is that the words of the Torah are actually the names of God. 65 Therefore, 
God is called the Torah. 66 From these examples it is clear that the statement in the Mishnah 
that everything is in the Torah is meant seriously: "Turn it and turn it over again, for 
everything is in it, and contemplate it, and wax gray and grow old over it, and stir not 
from it, for you cannot have any better rule than this." 67 

Just as the Torah is personified, so too are there several myths in which the letters of 
the alphabet come forth, one by one, at God's command, to make their cases as to why 



INTRODUCTION lv 


they should head the other letters of the alphabet. 68 The honor goes to the letter aleph, 
while the letter bet is rewarded by being the first letter of the first word of the Torah, 
Bereshit, "in the beginning." There are also creation myths in which the world is created 
through the letters of the alphabet. 

For readers unfamiliar with rabbinic tradition, one unfamiliar concept may be that of 
a dual Torah: the Written Torah ( Torah she-bikhtav) that God dictated to Moses at Mount 
Sinai, and the Oral Torah ( Torah she-be-al-peh), the explanations of the hidden meanings of 
the Written Torah, which God explained to Moses rather than put in writing. This Oral 
Torah is the basis for the imaginative retellings of biblical accounts so commonly found 
in the rabbinic texts. The radical changes brought to the original narrative are justified on 
the grounds that they were handed down as part of the Oral Torah. 

Note that the tradition of the Oral Torah and the Written Torah is not the only example 
of dual Torahs to be found. There is also the concept of the Primordial Torah — the Torah 
as it exists in Heaven — which is contrasted with the Earthly Torah. 69 This myth makes it 
clear that these two Torahs are not the same. Also, there is an extensive tradition about 
the first tablets that Moses received at Mount Sinai, which he later smashed when he saw 
the people worshipping the golden calf. According to this tradition, the first tablets were 
much different than the second set that Moses received. While the first tablets were com- 
pletely positive, the second tablets include negative commandments. 70 

Another way of viewing the concept of two Torahs is to view it as two ways of inter- 
preting the text of the Torah. For the kabbalists, it was important to distinguish between 
the literal Torah, with its stories, laws, and commandments, and the eternal Torah through 
which the world was created. This led them to a search for the inner meaning of the 
Torah. Thus, the kabbalists were focused on discovering the mystical meaning. The Zohar, 
the primary text of kabbalah, is a compendium of these mystical interpretations. As the 
Zohar puts it about the teachings of one rabbi, "For every single word of Torah, he used to 
expound supernal mysteries." 71 

God's determination to give the gift of the Torah to Israel is described in blunt terms in 
one midrash: God picks up Mount Sinai and, while holding the mountain over the heads 
of the people of Israel, asks them whether they are willing to accept the Torah. Under the 
circumstances, they agree to accept it. 72 

Any discussion of the holy word must consider the importance of prayer. In the rab- 
binic view, God especially treasures the prayers of Israel and there is even an angel, 
Sandalphon, who gathers these prayers for God and weaves them into garlands that God 
wears as a crown of prayers while seated on His Throne of Glory. Faced with a history 
that resembled a litany of disasters, prayer was often the last recourse for the Jews, for it 
was believed to be their only hope of restoring God's faith in them. 

Even today observant Jews spend a good deal of their day fulfilling the obligations set 
out in the Torah and subsequent texts, and they direct their minds and hearts several 
times a day through the medium of formal worship and private prayer. God, for His part, 
upholds the covenant established with Israel. And in all of these cases the means of com- 
munication between the human and the divine take the form of holy words, spoken as 
prayers or as texts inscribed on parchment 73 , words that carry the reverberations of the 
eternal in every syllable. 

6. Myths of the Holy Time 

The major Jewish holy days are all closely linked to key Jewish myths. Rosh ha-Shanah 
is linked to the creation of the world; it is often referred to as "the birthday of the world." 
Yom Kippur is the day when God seals the Books of Life and Death. Sukkot remembers the 
Exodus, Passover recounts the escape from Egyptian bondage, and Shavuot recalls the 
giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. On Simhat Torah, the cycle of reading the Torah comes 
to an end and begins again, so that Satan cannot accuse the Jews of having finished with 



lvi INTRODUCTION 


the Torah. Above all, the Sabbath, which recurs weekly, is closely associated with the day 
God rested after six days of Creation. Certainly, from the perspective of the ritual require- 
ments of these holy days, myth and ritual are inextricably linked. By performing these 
rituals and reenacting these myths, it becomes possible to enter into a holy realm, where 
one can participate in an active covenant with God and seek out His mercy. 

One key to the power of these holy days in the lives of the people is that of sacred time. 
During the Sabbath, for example, a distinct change takes place in the perception of time. 
There is a shift from the temporal to the eternal, as the focus changes to contemplation of 
the divine. In this sacred time a sense of holiness pervades the world, and the meaning of 
every action is magnified. At the same time, a holy presence can be sensed, which is 
identified as the Sabbath Queen. The kabbalistic principle of "as above, so below" de- 
fines all actions, and every ritual, from lighting the Sabbath candles to reciting the bless- 
ings over bread and wine, takes on a greater significance. In entering into sacred time, it 
can also be said that the people enter a mythic realm where the Sabbath Queen, invoked 
through prayer and song, can be perceived as an actual presence. 

Sacred time is experienced not only during the holy days, but every day, during morn- 
ing, afternoon, and evening prayers. For every time a minyan (traditionally, a quorum of 
ten men) gathers and the service begins, the congregation stands as petitioners before 
God, putting their fates in God s hands. The confidence that God is listening to their 
prayers derives from the unusual covenant between God and the people of Israel. This is 
not only a legal covenant, but a powerful bond between God and the chosen people. This 
covenant is the central myth at the heart of Judaism. It serves as a framework for all the 
other myths that grow out of that covenant, and, in particular, it encompasses all of the 
Myths of the Holy— the holy word, the holy time, the holy people, and the holy land. 

One technique commonly used in the myths of the holy time is allegorical personifica- 
tion. In some of these myths the Torah is personified as a bride. In others the Sabbath is 
personified as a princess, a bride, or a queen. This grows out of the tradition of the Sab- 
bath Queen, one of the identities of the Shekhinah. The first indications of the link be- 
tween the Shekhinah and the Sabbath Queen are found in the Talmud, concerning the 
Sabbath customs of two rabbis: "Rabbi Haninah robed himself and stood at sunset on the 
eve of the Sabbath and exclaimed, 'Come and let us go forth to welcome the Sabbath 
Queen/ And on Sabbath Eve, Rabbi Yannai would don his robes and exclaim, 'Come, O 
Bride, come, O Bride !'" 74 Thus the myths of the Sabbath as a princess are simply alluding 
to the tradition of the Sabbath Queen, which, in turn, refers to the Shekhinah — God's pres- 
ence in this world as a participant of the Sabbath ritual. This holy presence is continu- 
ally invoked throughout the Sabbath. The hymn Lekhah Dodi, composed by Shlomo 
Alkabetz in the sixteenth century, is recited in the synagogue to welcome the Sabbath 
Queen, thus initiating the Sabbath. In a more elaborate form of this ritual, Kabbalat Shabbat, 
the congregation goes outside to welcome the Sabbath Queen. This ritual might be seen 
as a kind of goddess worship, since it invokes a mythic feminine presence. Further, every 
aspect of the Sabbath fulfills a sacred requirement, even the lovemaking between man 
and wife on Friday night. Such lovemaking is said to take place under the shelter of the 
Shekhinah. It is required because, as the Zohar puts it, "in a place where male and female 
are not muted, God will not take up His dwelling place, for blessing prevails only in a 
place where male and female are present ." 75 And God's dwelling place in this world is, 
by definition, the Shekhinah, the Divine Presence. 

In an interesting variation of this theme of allegorical personification, the Torah also is 
identified as a ketubah, a wedding contract, written for the wedding of God and Israel, 
where God represents the Groom and Israel, the bride : 76 



INTRODUCTION Ivii 


On Friday, the sixth of Sivan, the day appointed by the Lord for the revelation of 
the Torah to His beloved people, God came forth from Mount Sinai. The Groom, the 
Lord, the King of Hosts, is betrothed to the bride, the community of Israel, arrayed in 
beauty The Bridegroom said to the pious and virtuous maiden, Israel, who had won 
His favor above all others: "Can there be a bridal canopy without a bride? As I live . . 

. you shall don them all like jewels , deck yourself with them like a bride (Isa. 49:18). Many 
days will you be Mine and I will be your Redeemer. Be My mate according to the law 
of Moses and Israel, and I will honor, support, and maintain you, and be your shelter 
and refuge in everlasting mercy. And I will set aside the life-giving Torah for you, by 
which you and your children will live in health and tranquility. This Covenant shall 
be valid and binding forever and ever." 

Thus an eternal Covenant, binding forever, has been established between them, 
and the Bridegroom and the bride have given their oaths to carry it out. May the 
Bridegroom rejoice with the bride whom He has taken as His lot, and may the bride 
rejoice with the Husband of her youth. 

It is the custom to read this allegorical text in Ladino on the holiday of Shavuot, which 
commemorates the giving of the Torah. It thus serves as a clear statement that the giving 
of the Torah was a covenant — here described as a wedding — between God and Israel, 
and underscores their mutual responsibilities, as in any marriage. God, the Groom, takes 
responsibility for protecting and supporting His bride, Israel, and Israel, in turn, reaf- 
firms her loyalty and devotion to God. This kind of mutuality sums up the purpose of 
Jewish ritual, in which the people of Israel reach out to God for sustenance of every kind, 
spiritual as well as physical, and God responds by providing it for them, expecting, in 
return, their unceasing devotion. This is the essence of the covenant between God and 
Israel, which is reaffirmed daily, especially during sacred time. 

7. Myths of the Holy People 

The patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are known as the Fathers, and their wives, 
Sarah, Rebecca, Leah and Rachel, as the Mothers. Abraham is addressed as Avraham Avinu, 
"Our Father Abraham." Except for Rachel, all of the Fathers and Mothers are said to be 
buried in the Cave of Machpelah in the city of Hebron. They are held in the greatest rever- 
ence, not only as patriarchs and matriarchs, but as beloved members of one's own family, 
for since Abraham was deemed the first Jew, all other Jews must be his descendants. Thus 
the pattern of great patriarchal figures who were looming presences was established, and 
subsequent figures such as Joseph, Moses, and King David joined this pantheon. 

One major way in which the traditions surrounding these holy people became embel- 
lished was through the application of the midrashic process, by which gaps in the bibli- 
cal narrative were filled in through a unique, imaginative method that tried to read 
between the lines. Using this method, the childhood of Abraham was constructed out of 
thin air, using the template provided by the story of the childhood of Moses. So too were 
many details about the journey of Abraham and Isaac to Mount Moriah, where Isaac was 
to be sacrificed, added to the biblical account. 77 Indeed, the ultimate result of this midrashic 
method was to substantially enlarge the primary biblical narratives, creating a kind of 
Book of the Book. 

Most remarkable are the kinds of transformations that came to be attributed to some 
biblical figures. Enoch, who is barely mentioned in the genealogy that goes from Adam 
to Noah, 78 ascends on high and is transformed into Metatron, chief among the angels. In 
these commentaries we learn that God, not Abraham, was Isaac's true father, while his 
mother was "the virgin Sarah." 79 And we also learn that Sarah was not barren, for al- 
though she did not give birth to any children before Isaac, she gave birth to souls. 80 Equally 
astonishing are some of the rabbinic traditions about Jacob. Not only are Jacob's highly 



lviii INTRODUCTION 


questionable acts toward his brother Esau— buying his birthright and stealing the bless- 
ing of the firstborn— justified in rabbinic legend, but Jacob himself is raised to virtually 
divine heights. 1 In some versions Jacob is revealed to be an angel, while in others he is 
identified as an even higher being. The evidence for these traditions about Enoch and 
Jacob is substantial, with these figures taking on demiurgic proportions. 

In particular, the lives of the patriarchs and their successors were carefully scrutinized, 
and served as role models for the people. When the people faced extermination from 
their enemies, they recalled Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac on Mount 
Moriah, and they were consoled. When they were sent into exile after the destruction of 
the Temple in 586 bce, they identified with Joseph, who was forced into Egyptian exile, 
and, like him, they vowed to return to the Holy Land at the first opportunity. Certainly 
the creation of the State of Israel in our time is directly related to the belief that any Jew 
living outside the Land of Israel is living in galut, in exile. 

So precious were these patriarchal figures that there was even a great reluctance to 
accept their deaths as final. Instead, there are myths and folktales to be found that clearly 
assert that Abraham, Jacob, Moses and King David never died. And, in the sense that 
each remains a powerful presence, this is true. 82 

8. Myths of the Holy Land 

One way to view the sacred nature of the Land of Israel is to see it as a continuation of the 
Garden of Eden, the very archetype of a sacred place. The garden is described as a place of 
abundance, where every need of Adam and Eve could be met. Once Adam and Eve were 
exiled from the garden, its location was lost, and the Holy Land can be seen to assume many 
of its sacred qualities. In this view, Eretz Yisrael, the Land of Israel, is a holy land singled out by 
God for an abundance of blessings: It is a land which Yahiveh your God looks after, on which 
Yahweh your God always keeps His eye, from year’s beginning to year's end (Deut. 11:12). 

Some texts speak of a primordial light created on the first day of Creation that has its 
source in the Holy Land, at the very place where the Temple in Jerusalem was built. 
While the windows of most buildings are made to let light in, the windows of the Temple 
were built to let light out, and that light is said to have been the source of the holiness of 
the land. 83 The Lurianic myth of the Shattering of the Vessels describes how God sent 
forth vessels of primordial light, which shattered and scattered their sparks everywhere, 
but especially on the Holy Land. 

For the great commentator Nachmarudes, known as Ramban, the Holy Land is more 
of a spiritual place than a real one: "The Land is not like Egypt, which is irrigated by the 
Nile like a garden. The Land of Israel is a land of hills and valleys almost exclusively 
intended to absorb the dew of heaven." 84 For even though the physical Land of Israel 
exists, its essence is a spiritual matter, a life force coming from God. By entering the Land 
of Israel, a man becomes part of its sacred nature. And all those who walk as little as four 
cubits in the Land of Israel are assured of a share in the World to Come, while all who are 
buried in the Land of Israel— it is as if they were buried beneath the altar of the Temple in 
Jerusalem. 85 Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, one of the most influential hasidic rabbis, as- 
serted that prayers originating in the Land of Israel can bring about miracles and true 
wonders for the entire world. 86 Indeed, the covenant between God and the people of 
Israel is manifest in the Land of Israel. As Rav Kook, the first chief rabbi of modem Israel, 
put it, "Love for our Holy Land is the foundation of the Torah." 87 

The city of Jerusalem, a city holy to Jews, Christians, and Muslims, is also portrayed in 
mythic terms. Not only is there a Jerusalem on earth, but there is a mirror image of Jerusa- 
lem in heaven. They are identical, except that the Temple in the heavenly Jerusalem still 



INTRODUCTION lix 


exists, whereas the one in this world was destroyed. If anyone prays in Jerusalem, it is as 
though he were praying before the Throne of Glory. For the Gate of Heaven is there, and 
the door is open for prayer to be heard. It is said that all the trees of Jerusalem were made 
of cinnamon. When their wood was kindled, their perfume would spread through the 
Land of Israel. But when the Temple was destroyed, these trees were hidden away. It is 
also told that because of the fragrance of the incense, brides in Jerusalem did not have to 
perfume themselves. All of the people of Israel entered Jerusalem three times a year for 
the festival, yet Jerusalem was never filled. No one ever said, "There is no place for me to 
lodge in Jerusalem." Not only that, but it is said that no one was ever attacked by demons 
in Jerusalem. And while the Temple still stood, no one who remained in Jerusalem over- 
night remained guilty of sin. The presence of the Temple purified their sins. 88 

God's covenant with Abraham in Genesis 13:14-17 is often referred to as a kind of deed 
bestowing the right to all of the Land of Israel on the people of Israel: "Raise your eyes and 
look out from where you are, to the north and south, to the east and west, for I give all the land that 
you see to you and your offspring forever. " In case there was any doubt about how far Abraham 
could see, God is said to have raised Abraham up over the Land of Israel and showed him 
all of the land. 89 The intractable conflict in the Middle East between Israel and the Palestin- 
ians derives from this belief in the sanctity of the Holy Land, especially of Jerusalem, shared 
by Jews and Muslims. This serves as a compelling reminder of the enduring and some- 
times destructive power of these myths, which are not always benign. 

Not only are the places of the Holy Land, such as Hebron, Beersheva and, of course, 
Jerusalem, linked with some of the primary episodes of the Bible, but there is a multitude 
of postbiblical myths and legends associated with them as well. Above all, Jerusalem is 
the jewel of the Holy Land, viewed as the navel of the world: Thus said the Lord God: "I set 
this Jerusalem in the midst of nations, with countries round about her " (Ezek. 5:5). This idea is 
restated in the Talmud: "The Holy Land was created first, and then the rest of the world." 90 
The Temple that was twice built there and twice destroyed was not only regarded as the 
center of the Holy Land, but it was believed to have been built on the spot of the Founda- 
tion Stone that was regarded as the starting point and center of all Creation. 91 The West- 
ern Wall at the Temple Mount, also known as the Wailing Wall, has become the holiest 
Jewish site in the world. Those who visit there write a petition to God, known as qvittel, 
and put it in the cracks of the Wall. According to tradition, that is a certain method of 
contacting God. So powerful is this folk belief that many Jewish visitors to Israel leave 
messages to God in one of the cracks of the Wall. 

9. Myths of Exile 

The theme of exile makes its first, indelible appearance in Jewish tradition when God 
expels Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. Ever after, Jewish myth and history are full 
of examples of those who are uprooted and forced to leave their homes and wander, some- 
times for many generations. From the beginning of Genesis, the pattern is clear: after Cain 
kills his brother, Abel, God turns him into a wanderer and exile, a punishment Cain consid- 
ers too great to bear (Gen. 4:13). 92 Noah and his family are exiled from all of humanity when 
God brings down a deluge that destroys all other life on earth. The inhabitants of the land 
of Shinar seek to avoid being scattered, and therefore set out to build a tower, the Tower of 
Babel, which, in the end, causes God to send them into exile after all. God tells Abraham to 
leave his home in Haran and set out for the land that God would reveal to him. After 
stealing his brother's blessing, Jacob goes into exile in the city of Haran in order to escape 
his brother's vengeance. As for Joseph, he was sold into Egyptian bondage, and taken far 
away from home. And Moses is separated from his family and his people and raised in 
exile. Later he is further exiled from the house of Pharaoh. 



lx INTRODUCTION 


And, of course, there is the ultimate paradigm of liberation from exile, that of the 
Exodus. This myth presents in archetypal fashion all stages of the quest to liberate the 
people Israel from Egyptian bondage, to fashion them as a people through 40 years of 
wandering, to bestow on them the greatest treasure, God's own teachings, dictated by 
God to Moses at Mount Sinai, and to lead them back to the Holy Land. This monumental 
exile thoroughly reshaped the people of Israel and resulted in a sacred text, the Torah, 
that would sustain the Jewish people for the next 3,000 years. 93 

After the Exodus, the best-known Jewish myth of exile is probably that of the Ten Lost 
Tribes. 94 The Assyrian conquest of the northern Kingdom of Israel in 722 bce dispersed 
the ten tribes who lived there, leaving only the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, who consti- 
tuted the southern Kingdom of Judah. The mystery of the fate of those lost tribes gave 
birth to a multitude of legends about them, as well as accounts of visitors who claimed to 
have reached them, including Eldad ha-Dani, Benjamin of Tudela and David Re'uveni. 
In most of these legends these tribes are described as being exceedingly pious and obser- 
vant. In some folktales, however, they are described as "little red Jews from the other side 
of the river Sambatyon. In order to explain why the lost tribes could not rejoin their 
brethren, they were said to be trapped on the other side of this pious river, which threw 
up rocks as high as a house six days a week and was therefore impassable, and only 
rested on the Sabbath. But the pious lost tribes could not cross then either, since no work 
is permitted on the Sabbath. This myth of the Ten Lost Tribes has given birth to farfetched 
efforts to identify where they went. Ethiopian Jews identify themselves as descendants 
of the tribe of Dan, and there are many far-flung, unlikely peoples, including the Japa- 
nese, the Celts, and Native Americans, who have been identified as among the lost tribes. 

In general, then, exile serves as God's punishment, as clearly stated in Midrash ha- 
Ne'elam in Zohar Hadash 23c: "Every time the Jewish people were sent into exile, God set 
a limit to the exile, and they were always aroused to repentance. But this final exile has 
no set limit, and everything depends upon repentance." However, beginning in the six- 
teenth century, the belief arose that the dispersion of the Jewish people had a special 
purpose other than punishment, to enable them to serve as a guide to humanity. 95 Alter- 
nately, the Jewish people were viewed as serving a mystical function in raising up holy 
sparks that had been scattered around the world, as portrayed in the Lurianic kabbalah. 96 
Thus, for the Ari, Rabbi Isaac Luria, the purpose of the many exiles of the Jews was to 
extricate the imprisoned sparks that were lodged in foreign lands. He believed that by 
living in Egypt the Israelites took all the holy sparks out of Egypt, defeating the forces of 
impurity that abounded in the desert. Rabbi Hayim Tirer of Chemovitz describes this 
process: "When the Jews left Egypt, all the holy sparks of Egypt flocked to them and 
departed with them." ( Be'er Mayim Hayim , Noah 162). This mythic interpretation turned a 
pumshment into a blessing, where God depended on His people, Israel, as much as they 
depended on Hun. It clearly demonstrates that the theme of exile can be viewed from 
two perspectives. B. Berakhot 3a describes it as a painful exile: "Alas for the children who 
have been exiled from their Father's table." But, according to Exodus Rabbah 2:4, "It was 
in the wilderness that Israel received the manna, the quail, Miriam's well, the Torah, the 
Tabernacle, the Shekhinah, priesthood, kingship, and the Clouds of Glory." 

The other side of the coin of exile is return, and the theme of return is also exception- 
ally powerful in Judaism. There is the constant longing to return to the Holy Land. The 
final words of the Passover Seder, recounting the Exodus, are "Next Year in Jerusalem!" 97 
So too is the theme of return the underlying motif in the wide array of messianic myths in 
Judaism. The arrival of the Messiah, it is believed, will transform all existence, and all 
Jews will miraculously travel to the Holy Land. This, the initiation of the messianic era, 
will be the ultimate return. 98 



INTRODUCTION lxi 


10. Myths of the Messiah 

Myths of exile are naturally linked to myths of redemption, as exile leads a people to 
dream of redemption. While redemption takes many forms, its primary focus in Judaism 
is on the transforming role of the Messiah, a divine figure who, it is said, will descend to 
this world and initiate the End of Days. The longing for the Messiah is a direct result of 
the hardship and exile within Jewish history. Since the time of the prophet Isaiah, no one 
idea has obsessed the Jews more than this: When will the coming of the Messiah take 
place? Every Jew hoped it would be in his lifetime. Some Hasidim kept their staffs and 
white robes by the door, ready to answer the Messiah's call on the shortest notice. Even 
today many observant Jews still anxiously await the arrival of the Messiah, which is 
expected to initiate a heaven on earth, known as the End of Days. Of course, the require- 
ments to be the Messiah are steep, and there are three: raising the dead, restoring the 
exiles to the Land of Israel, and rebuilding the Temple in Jerusalem." 

What follows the coming of the Messiah might be described as heaven on earth, a new 
incarnation of the Garden of Eden, making the cycle that started with the expulsion from 
Eden complete. The first era of history will be over, and a new era will begin. At the same 
time, the coming of the Messiah will bring about the repair of the rent in heaven that resulted 
from the separation of God from His Bride. For only the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusa- 
lem, the Shekhinah's home in this world, can restore God's Bride to Him, and the rebuilding 
will not take place until the Messiah comes. 100 Thus the fate of everything hangs on the Mes- 
siah, for the messianic era will bring about a cosmic healing both in heaven and on earth. 

In this new era, the righteous among the sons and daughters of Israel will receive a 
heavenly reward that includes not only studying Torah with the Messiah, the patriarchs, 
and the sages, but even Torah classes taught by God. At the same time, the punishments 
of the souls of sinners in Gehenna will come to an end, and they too will be brought into 
Paradise. All this will follow the coming of the Messiah. 

The cycle of messianic myths is quite complete. It starts with the creation of the Mes- 
siah, and includes the birth of the Messiah, the events that will initiate the End of Days, 
and accounts of the messianic era that will follow. 

It quickly becomes evident that there are two basic concepts of the Messiah: one, a 
heavenly figure of supernatural origin who makes his home in a heavenly palace; the 
other, a human Messiah, an exceptionally righteous man who takes on the mantle of the 
Messiah and initiates the End of Days. In time, these two separate motifs were combined 
into a single myth in a clever manner: there were said to be two Messiahs, whose fates 
were linked. 101 One is identified as Messiah the son of Joseph (Messiah ben Joseph) and 
the other is the heavenly Messiah, Messiah the son of David (Messiah ben David). 102 
According to this combined myth, Messiah ben Joseph, the human Messiah, will be a 
warrior who will go to war against the evil forces of Gog and Magog 103 and die in the 
process. He will be followed by Messiah ben David, the heavenly Messiah, who will 
defeat the evil empire and initiate the End of Days. In some versions of this myth, Mes- 
siah ben David will prove he is the real Messiah by resurrecting Messiah ben Joseph. 104 

In the myths of the heavenly Messiah, he is described as a supernatural figure living in 
his own heavenly palace, known as the Bird's Nest, waiting to be called upon to initiate 
the End of Days. 105 Some versions of this myth emphasize his suffering, 106 while others 
describe the Messiah as being held captive in heaven or in hell. 107 

All of these variants of the myth have in common the portrayal of a supernatural, 
heavenly figure who is forced to wait impatiently until the circumstances are such that it 
becomes possible for him to fulfill his messianic destiny. But the portrayal of the earthly 
Messiah is quite a bit different. In one famous talmudic version, he is described as a 



lxii INTRODUCTION 


leprous beggar waiting outside the gates of Rome, who takes off and puts on his ban- 
dages one at a time, so that he will not be delayed if he is suddenly called. 108 But in 
general the human Messiah is described as the Tzaddik ha-Dor, the greatest sage of his 
generation, who will step into the role of Messiah if all the circumstances happen to be 
right. Naturally, there are many failures, due to one mistake or another. These are re- 
counted in a series of myths about why the Messiah has not yet come. There are enough 
accounts of these failures to fill a book. There are even stories about some rabbis, such as 
Joseph della Reina, who sought to force the coming of the Messiah. 109 

All sorts of signs and warnings are expected to precede the coming of the Messiah, 
great upheavals known as the Pangs of the Messiah. Historical turmoil has often been 
identified with these mythic wars, and has inevitably precipitated messianic expecta- 
tions. At the time that the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, three rabbis in Mea Sha arim, 
the ultra-Orthodox section of Jerusalem, were reported to have dreamed, on the same 
night, that the coming of the Messiah was imminent. This rumor spread among the entire 
community, all of whom waited on pins and needles for the footsteps of the Messiah to 
be heard. This demonstrates that the longing and expectations for the coming of the 
Messiah are as intense as ever in these communities. 

The Jewish mythology concerning the End of Days is just as elaborate as that found in 
the Book of Revelation, whose portrayal of the Apocalypse is surely drawn from contem- 
porary Jewish eschatology. The messianic era will be heralded by great upheaval and an 
epic war known as the War of Gog and Magog. Finally, the new era will be announced by 
the prophet Elijah, blowing a horn from the ram that Abraham sacrificed on Mount Moriah 
(the other horn was blown at Mount Sinai). The righteous dead will be resurrected, and 
all the exiles will be gathered into the Holy Land, where the Temple will be supematu- 
rally rebuilt. In heaven, God will be reunited with His Bride, from whom He was sepa- 
rated at the time the Temple was destroyed. At that time the Messiah will address all of 
Israel, and the blessed days of the Messiah will begin. The messianic hope, with its prom- 
ise that He will destroy death forever (Isa. 25:8), has been fervently longed for since the days 
of Isaiah. Maimonides codified this hope in his Thirteen Principles of Faith, in which the 
twelfth principle is belief in the coming of the Messiah, which entered the popular do- 
main as the statement, "I believe with perfect faith in the coming of the Messiah. No 
matter how long he may tarry, I will await his coming every day." 

What about the belief in the Messiah in the modem era? Does it still have the power to 
compel widespread belief and expectation? For those who still firmly believe that God dic- 
tated the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai, the certainty of the coming of the Messiah is not 
viewed as myth but as truth, as codified by Maimonides. However, not all Orthodox Jews 
are equally impassioned about the coming of the Messiah. The Lubavitch Hasidim, in par- 
ticular, await His coming. Many of them expect their deceased Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem 
Mendel Schneersohn, to return to life and serve as the Messiah. 110 

As for non-Orthodox Jews, who make up the majority of modem Jews, most do not 
regard the Torah as the literal word of God. This view makes it possible to incorporate 
modem views into their practice of an ancient religion. Just as it seems unlikely to most 
of these Jews that the waters of the Red Sea really split apart, or that the sun stood still for 
Joshua, the coming of the Messiah is no longer expected. Even were the Messiah to ar- 
rive, it is highly unlikely that he would be recognized by those who were not expecting 
him. Instead, this tradition, like many others, has acquired the status of a myth, even if it 
has not been acknowledged as such.

III. Mythic Parallels 

If there is a mythology in Judaism, what model does it follow — that of pagan mythology, 
where there is a pantheon of gods, usually ruled by a divine pair? Does it follow a dual- 
istic model, where more than one god is involved in ruling the world? Or does it work 
within the monotheistic model, where there is but a single God who both created the 
world and rules it? While it might appear at first that only the monotheistic model was 
relevant, in fact, there is evidence of all three models in Jewish tradition. 

That some kind of God or gods exist, most humans have had no doubt. How else 
could the world have come into being? Thus the primary purpose of Western religion is 
to answer two elementary questions: "Who created the world?" and "Who rules it?" 111 
Among the religions of the ancient Near East, Judaism answered this question by insist- 
ing that there is but one God, whose name is YHVH, generally rendered in English as 
Yahweh. This principle is stated in the Shema, the central proclamation of Jewish belief: 
Hear O Israel , the Lord our God , the Lord is One (Deut. 6:4). That is the essence of Jewish 
monotheism. The great philosopher Maimonides always upheld monotheistic principles, 
writing, for example, that "There is one God who created everything and who guides the 
celestial spheres." 112 In this view, the same God who created the world rules it. 

In contrast, some dualistic systems propose the existence of two gods. In Gnosticism, 
an evil god, known as the demiurge, created and rules this world, and the only hope of 
salvation comes from a higher, benevolent Deity. While the doctrine of a good god and an 
evil one is not found in Judaism, there are numerous instances where God shares his 
ruling powers with other divine figures, such as Metatron, or the one God is described as 
bearing contradictory qualities of judgment and mercy. 113 

Polytheism, in the form of the Greek, Canaanite, and Egyptian religions, offered mul- 
tiple gods and a divine pantheon. Here, too, the original gods were usually not the ruling 
gods: Kronos is the father of the Greek gods, while Zeus is the ruling god; and it is the 
Canaanite god El, who wrested power from his father Samen (Heaven), who is supposed 
to be the ruling god, while actually it is Ba'al, El's son, who is the dominant ruler. 

These three models — the monotheistic model of the Jews (and later Christians and 
Muslims), the dualistic model of the Gnostics, and the pagan model of the Greeks and 
Canaanites — would seem mutually exclusive. For example, we would not expect to find 
myths about a dualistic divinity in Judaism, since there is only one God. But we do. 
Despite the inviolable principle of monotheism, there are many Jewish texts that have 
strongly gnostic characteristics and portray a second divine figure who plays an active 
role in the ruling of the world. Gershom Scholem identified these texts as examples of 
Jewish Gnosticism. 114 

At first it may be difficult to see how monotheism can include a second divine figure. By 
definition, monotheism is an assertion that there is only one God. Yet there are two models 
of monotheism in Judaism: one in which there is one god and no other divine figures higher 
than the rank of angels, and a second model, in which other divine figures are acknowl- 
edged to exist, but they are subject to God, who is the king of the gods. This second type of 
monotheism is known as "monolatry," where worship of only one God/god is allowed, 
but the existence of other gods is acknowledged, at least tacitly. 115 In Judaism, it is defined 
as a stage in the religion of ancient Israel when the existence of gods other than Yahweh was 
admitted, but their worship was strictly forbidden. 116 That there was worship of some for- 
bidden gods by the ancient Israelites has been demonstrated by archaeological discoveries, 
as well as by the tirades of the biblical prophets against such worship, such as the women 
weeping over Tammuz (Ezek. 8:14), or the people defending their worshipping the Queen 
of Heaven (Jer. 44:17-19). There is also evidence of the awareness of other gods in several 



lxiv INTRODUCTION 


biblical verses, such as Who is like You among the gods ( ba-elim ), O Lord? (Exod. 15:11). 117 Also, 
in Psalm 82, God stands in the divine assembly; among the divine beings ( Elohim ) He pronounces 
judgment (Ps. 82:1). 

The concept of monolatry goes a long way toward explaining the parallel develop- 
ment of folk religion in Judaism beyond the official kind, especially in the popular cul- 
ture. Although monolatry refers to the religion of ancient Israel, that does not mean that 
the kind of folk religion indicated by monolatry disappeared after the biblical period. 
Instead, it continued to evolve in its own way, far more open to mythological motifs than 
rabbinic Judaism. 118 By the time of the rabbinic period, the pagan religions against which 
the official religion was polemicizing no longer existed. Therefore the rabbis permitted 
these mythological motifs from the folk religion, which had elements of the ancient Near 
Eastern mythologies, to surface in a form that was then acceptable within the confines of 
rabbinic thought. This suggests that a great many rabbinic myths, as found in the 
midrashim, are not new creations of the rabbis, as might appear to be the case. 119 Rather, 
they are simply the writing down of an oral tradition that was kept alive by the people, 
when there was no need to suppress it any longer. 

A close examination of the Jewish mythic tradition reveals that its origins are found in 
Near Eastern mythology. Umberto Cassuto says of these mythic parallels: "These Israel- 
ite myths of the Bible are derived from similar myths current among the neighboring 
peoples concerning the war waged by one of the great gods against the deity of the sea. 
The famous Babylonian story about the war of Marduk against Tiamat is but one ex- 
ample of an entire series of similar narratives. Among the Israelites ... the traditional 
material that was current in the lands of the East was given by Israel an aspect more in 
accord with their ethos, to wit, the aspect of the revolt by the sea against his Creator." 120 

This and other Near Eastern mythologies clearly fueled the continuing evolution of Jew- 
ish myth, which incorporated and integrated the earlier mythology. New myths arose to 
fill the void created by the loss of the older pagan ones. These new myths involve not only 
God, but also God's Bride, the Shekhinah , 121 and like the Greek myths of Zeus and Hera, 
they sometimes converge and sometimes diverge and often give birth to additional myths. 
So too are there other mythical figures, including that of the Messiah, along with angels, 
demons, spirits, and fabulous creatures of the air, earth, and sea, such as the Ziz, a giant 
mythical bird, Behemoth, a giant land animal, and Leviathan, a monstrous sea creature. 

There are many often intriguing parallels to be found between Jewish myth and that of 
the Greeks and Canaanites. Many of these parallels concern the nature of God. Just as Zeus 
and El are warrior gods, so too is God a warrior, as in the verse Yahweh is a man of war (Exod. 
15:3), although, of course, this is only one aspect of God. In some sources God is said to 
have smitten the Egyptians with His finger, while in others God is described as a mighty 
warrior, carrying a fiery bow, with a sword of lightning, traveling through the heavens in a 
chariot. Confirming the image of God as a great warrior. Exodus Rabbah 5:14 states that 
God's bow was fire. His arms flame. His spear a torch, the clouds His shield, and His 
sword lightning. The parallels to Zeus and the warrior gods of the Near East are clear: 

Yahweh is a mighty warrior, who defeated Pharaoh at the Red Sea. It is said that 
God smote them with His finger, as it is said. And the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is 
the finger of God" (Exod. 8:15). 

Others say that God appeared to Pharaoh as a mighty warrior, carrying a fiery 
bow, with a sword of lightning, traveling through the heavens in a chariot. When 
Pharaoh shot arrows at Israel, God shot fiery arrows back. When Pharaoh's army cast 
rocks, God brought hail. And when Pharaoh shot fiery arrows from a catapult, God 
deluged them with burning coals. Finally Pharaoh exhausted his entire armory. Then 
God took a cherub from His Throne of Glory and rode upon it, waging war against 



INTRODUCTION lxv 


Pharaoh and Egypt, as it is said. He mounted a cherub and flew (Ps. 18:11). Leaping from 
one wing to another, God taunted Pharaoh, "O evil one, do you have a cherub? Can 
you do this?" 

When the angels saw that God was waging war against the Egyptians on the sea, 
they came to His aid. Some came carrying swords and others carrying bows or lances. 

God said to them, "I do not need your aid, for when I go out to battle, I go alone." That 
is why it is said that Yahweh is a man of war (Exod. 15:3). 122 

One might wonder where this extravagant description of God the Warrior comes from, 
but most of the central images can be traced back to several biblical verses. The foremost 
is Yahweh is a man of war. And the intensely mythic description of God riding upon a 
cherub is found in the verse He mounted a cherub and flew. The portrayal of God traveling 
through heavens in a chariot, so similar to that of Apollo, may well be a remnant of sun 
worship in Judaism. 123 A parallel kind of sun worship can also be seen in the myths sur- 
rounding Enoch's transformation into Metatron, as Metatron is described in fiery imag- 
ery, and Metatron himself is identified as a ruling divinity. As for God's Chariot, known 
as the Merkavah, it is based on the vision of Ezekiel (Ezek. 1:1-28). God is said to have 
taken the cherub from between the wheels of this chariot. 

Another important parallel concerns a conflict of cosmic importance between God 
and His Bride, as described in the Zohar and other kabbalistic sources. It resembles the 
disputes between Zeus and Hera in Greek mythology, where, for example, Hera, an- 
gered by Zeus's infidelities, led a conspiracy in which Zeus was bound with leather thongs 
as he slept. In revenge, Zeus hung Hera from the sky with a golden bracelet on each of 
her wrists, and with an anvil fastened to each of her ankles. 124 While the conflict between 
God and His Bride never reached this kind of acrimony, God and the Shekhinah are still 
described in the Zohar as arguing over the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. 125 This 
confrontation results in God's Bride separating from Him, choosing to go into exile with 
Her children, Israel. It is this separation, more than anything else, that announces the 
arrival of the Shekhinah' s mythic independence, in which the Shekhinah functions more as 
an independent mythic being than as the feminine aspect of God. Here, however, God 
does not seek revenge as does Zeus. Instead, he mourns over His losses, in a surprising 
series of myths about God's suffering. 126 

In addition, there are remarkable parallels to the crucial myths of Creation, the Fall, and 
the Flood. There are Greek creation myths similar to the Genesis account of Creation found 
in Hesiod's Theogony, 127 in which there is a union between darkness and chaos. What is 
missing in these myths is God's role in combining these elements to create the world. 

» In two cases, there appear to be direct borrowing from Greek myth. One Jewish myth 
portrays Joshua, the successor of Moses, as Oedipus, while another describes a Jewish Icarus. 128 

Likewise, the biblical account of Eve eating the forbidden fruit and its myriad conse- 
quences has striking parallels to the story of Pandora, who set free the winged Evils, the 
misfortunes that plague mankind: Old Age, Labor, Sickness, Insanity, Vice, and Passion. 129 
Both hearken back to a primordial sin, and both provide a myth of the origin of evil. Yet 
both myths include a forward-looking hope for redemption. In Pandora's case, Hope is 
the last to come out of the box. 130 And in the case of Eve there is hope for the Messiah. 

An even closer parallel to the story of Pandora is found in Genesis Rabbah 19:10: "A woman 
came to the wife of a snake-charmer to borrow vinegar. 'How does your husband treat 
you?' she asked the wife. 'He treats me very well,' the woman answered, l^ut he does not 
permit me to approach this cask, which is full of serpents.' The visiting woman said, 'Surely 
your husband is deceiving you and the cask is full of finery he plans to give to another 
woman.' Hearing this, the wife inserted her hand into the cask, and the serpents began 



lxvi INTRODUCTION 


biting her. When her husband came home, he heard her crying out in pain. 'Have you 
touched that cask?' he demanded to know. Thus, God said to Adam and Eve, Did you eat of 
the tree from which I had forbidden you to eat?" (Gen. 3:11). 

Above all, many parallels exist to the biblical account of the Flood. One Mesopotamian 
Flood myth is found in the Epic of Atrahasis, who, like Noah, is the survivor of the great 
Flood. The god Ea-Enki advises Atrahasis to build an ark. Ea-Enki says: "Place a roof 
over the barge, cover it as the heavens cover the earth. Do not let the sun see inside. 
Enclose it completely. Make the joints strong. Caulk the timbers with pitch." 131 This is 
very much like the directions God gives to Noah to build the ark. 132 So too does Atrahasis 
fill the ark with animals. 

Another Flood myth, an even closer parallel, is found in the Mesopotamian epic of 
Gilgamesh, in which Utnapishtim is parallel to Noah. Ea, the divine patron of fresh water, 
warns Utnapishtim about the coming Flood and tells him to build an ark and take speci- 
mens of every living thing on board. In this way Utnapishtim and his wife are the lone 
human survivors of a Flood brought on by the divine assembly that was intended to 
destroy every other mortal. 

Another great Flood myth, this one Greek, is recounted in the Latin poet Ovid's Meta- 
morphoses. It is remarkably similar to the biblical account of Noah, and even includes a 
dove. Here Zeus floods the earth, intending to wipe out the entire race of man. But 
Deucalion, King of Phthia, is warned by his father, Prometheus, and builds an ark. All the 
world is flooded, and all mortal creatures are lost except for Deucalion and his wife, 
Pyrrha. Deucalion sends out a dove on an exploratory flight, and is reassured by it. 133 

These Flood narratives with their distinct parallels strongly suggest that all of them — 
including the biblical narrative of the Flood — are based on the same ancient Mesopotamian 
tradition from the third millennium bce. 

Parallels also exist between the Jewish heavenly pantheon and the Greek. The Jewish 
pantheon is just as extensive, but with a host of angels playing roles equivalent to those 
of the Greek gods. Thus, instead of Poseidon, there is the angel Rahab, who likewise 
rules the sea. Or just as Hermes is the divine messenger, so this role in Jewish mythology 
is played by the angel Raziel, who delivers a book of secrets to Adam. And the angel 
Metatron, who is described in terms of the sun, plays a role similar to that of Helios, the 
Greek God of the sun. 

There are also striking parallels involving Prometheus. Just as Prometheus is said to 
have formed man out of clay and water, so the angel Michael (or, some say, Gabriel) is 
said, in some sources, to have formed the body of Adam. And while it is widely known 
that Prometheus brought fire from heaven and gave it to humankind, 134 it is far less known 
that in some Jewish myths Adam plays a very Promethean role, bringing down both 
light and fire from heaven for the sake of humankind. 135 

Some of the most interesting parallels are those between Jewish and Christian sources. 
In Christianity, God is said to have incarnated His son, Jesus, as a human; thus the es- 
sence of the Christian myth is that a divine figure became a human being. This follows 
the pattern of Jewish myth where it is angels who are incarnated as human. Genesis 6 
describes how the Sons of God cohabited with the daughters of men, begetting giants. 
Rabbinic commentaries identify the Sons of God as two angels, Shemhazai and Azazel, 
who descended from on high, took on human form, and sought out human women for 
lovers. 136 These angels revealed all kinds of heavenly secrets, including magical spells, 
and taught women the arts of seduction. In addition, the prophet Elijah, who was taken 
into heaven in a fiery chariot, is an angel who often appears in human form on earth. 137 

Another variant of this divine-to-human pattern concerns how the talmudic sage Rabbi 
Ishmael was conceived. It is said that Rabbi Ishmael's mother was so pious that God sent 



INTRODUCTION lxvii 


the angel Gabriel to take the form of her husband and to meet her at the mikveh, the ritual 
bath, and to conceive a child with her. She, of course, had no idea that it was a disguised 
angel and not her husband who met her. She conceived that day, and when Rabbi Ishmael 
was bom, he was said to have been as beautiful as an angel. 138 This is the same theme of 
human women having intercourse with an angel, but here it is with God's approval, 
while the angels Shemhazai and Azazel broke their promise to God that they would not 
fall into sinful ways. 

So too are there myths in which the patriarch Jacob is identified as an angel who came 
down to earth in human form. We can now see that this myth, so strange at first, is part of 
an explicit pattern in Jewish mythology, that of a divine figure becoming human. Some- 
times these echoes even become overt. The first century philosopher, Philo, proposed 
that it was God who begat Isaac, not Abraham, although God made sure that Isaac closely 
resembled Abraham. Philo even says that this child was bom to the "virgin" Sarah. Here 
we find a direct parallel to later Christian lore. 139 Indeed, there are an extensive number 
of parallels with Hellenistic and Canaanite mythology. What this indicates is that Jewish 
mythology was not isolated from the other mythologies. It was resonant with the motifs 
that were the psychic currency of their neighboring cultures. 

Christian tradition is built upon Jewish sources, especially on the myths of heaven 
and on the messianic tradition. In Christian theology, Jesus is said to have fulfilled the 
long-awaited messianic prophecies stated in Isaiah and elsewhere. Those who recog- 
nized Jesus as the Messiah became Christians. Those who did not remained Jews, still 
awaiting the Messiah. 

While the Christian dependence on Jewish tradition is irrefutable, there are also Jew- 
ish myths that were influenced by Christianity. In the Christian interpretation of the bind- 
ing of Isaac, a direct link is made between Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac, and 
God's willingness to sacrifice His son, Jesus. Abraham replied to Isaac's question about 
what they would sacrifice by saying, God Himself will provide the lamb , my son (Gen. 22:8). 
The Christian reading of this verse is that God will be making the sacrifice of his son, 
Jesus, who is identified as the lamb. Thus the linkage between Isaac and Jesus was well- 
established in Christian texts when we find a midrashic tradition that Abraham did slay 
Isaac, and that Isaac's soul ascended on high. He studied in the heavenly academy of 
Shem and Eber, and after three years his soul descended and he was resurrected. The 
parallel to the Christian doctrine of the resurrection of Jesus is clear — the major differ- 
ence is that of the three days of Jesus and the three years of Isaac. This, then, is a likely 
example of a Christian-influenced Jewish myth. 140 

So too is the Islamic tradition based on the Jewish one. Abraham is the Muslim as well 
as the Jewish patriarch, and while the Koran does not specify which son of Abraham 
climbed Mount Moriah with him, later Muslim exegesis identified him as Ishmael. 141 
There are also Islamic myths to be found about Adam as well as Abraham, and, of course, 
about Ishmael, Abraham's son by Hagar. 

The most prominent mythological parallels between Jews and Muslims are those concern- 
ing Jerusalem. The Temple Mount, where the Dome of the Rock was built, is sacred to both 
religions. Both identify the Temple Mount as Beth El, the place where Jacob had his dream of 
angels ascending and descending. In the Muslim version, God identifies Himself to Jacob as 
"The God of your fathers, Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac." Both believe that the terrestrial 
Temple was placed exactly below the celestial Temple, and that although the earthly Temple 
has been destroyed, the celestial Temple still remains. Both people believe that a ram's horn 
will be blown in Jerusalem on Judgment Day and both expect the resurrection of the dead to 
take place there. 142 From these examples it is clear that the Jewish and Muslim traditions 
about Jerusalem have a great many parallels, and in many cases are virtually identical. 



lxviii INTRODUCTION 


These are just a few of the many parallels to Greek, Christian, and Near Eastern myths 
that are found in Jewish sources. These parallels demonstrate that Jewish tradition did 
not exist in a vacuum, but that the kinds of motifs found in other traditions are mirrored, 
sometimes transformed, in Jewish lore. Thus Jewish mythology was not separate from 
the other surrounding mythologies, but very much a part of the existing tradition. 


IV. Myth and Ritual in Judaism 

According to the mythologist Walter F. Otto, "Myth demands ritual." 143 This is the central 
premise of the Myth and Ritual school of mythological studies. The intimate relationship 
between myth and ritual in Judaism confirms this approach. Many of the rituals of Juda- 
ism, such as those of the Sabbath or the saying of the Kaddish, the prayer for the dead, 
have their basis in some elemental myth, such as the creation of the world or the fate of 
the soul after death. Thus Judaism can be said to possess both of the primary elements of 
a mythic system: myth and ritual. 

As in other traditions, Jewish myth and ritual reaffirm and validate each other, for as 
long as they remain linked, the ritual keeps the myth alive. But as soon as the ritual falls 
into disuse, the myth loses its primary purpose: linking the past and the present through 
the acting out of the ritual. Without the ritual, the myth is no more than a story, albeit a 
powerful and compelling one. 

It is important to remind ourselves that what we call a myth was, or still is, someone 
else's truth. Among observant Jews, most of the texts identified as myths in this book still 
constitute divine truths from the Written Torah or the Oral Torah— that is, truths that 
originated with God. Likewise, for observant Jews, the stories that accompany Jewish 
rituals have retained the status of absolute truth. Indeed, the key test in our time 144 for 
whether one holds Orthodox views is whether one believes that God dictated the Torah 
to Moses at Mount Sinai. Without this belief, the seal of truth that binds the Torah and 
makes every word fraught with infinite meaning no longer exists. Thus, for believers, the 
ultimate truth of the Torah must be beyond any doubt. This is the essential condition for 
a mythic system to flourish. 

However, even for those Jews in our time who regard the stories of the Torah more as 
myths than as truths, the stories retain much of their inherent power. Like all myths, they 
are not arbitrary creations, but projections from the deepest levels of the Self. From this 
perspective, these stories can be read as psychic maps, as archetypes of the collective 
Jewish unconscious. Further, they are an essential part of a rich heritage that derives 
from an ancient past, and even those Jews who do not believe in the divine origin of the 
Torah may well regard themselves as descendants of Abraham. They also are likely to 
observe some of the most prominent Jewish rituals, such as participating in a Seder on 
Passover, celebrating a Jewish wedding, or, above all, observing the Sabbath. 

The Sabbath is openly intended to recall the seventh day of Creation, when God rested, 
as stated in Genesis 2:3: And Cod blessed the seventh day and hallowed it; because that day He 
rested from all His work which God in creating had made. It is interesting to note that the practi ce 
of observing a day of rest on the Sabbath appears to have existed prior to the giving of the 
Law at Mount Sinai. The account of the manna found in Exodus 16:25-30 includes an in- 
junction against collecting manna on the Sabbath; nor did the manna fall on that day. This 
indicates that the Sabbath was already recognized as a holy day, as God states, " See that 
Yahweh has given you the Sabbath" (Exod. 16:29). 145 So too was it identified as a day of rest. 

To emphasize the parallels between God's day of rest and the human day of rest, all 
forms of work are forbidden on the Sabbath, as stated in Exodus 20:10: But the seventh day 
is a sabbath of the Lord your God: you shall not do any work. The laws of the Sabbath include 



INTRODUCTION lxix 


dozens of kinds of activities that are defined as work and therefore forbidden, such as 
lighting a fire, carrying of any kind, or writing, as well as any exchange of money. 146 The 
point of this blanket prohibition against work on the Sabbath is to remind the people at 
every turn that they, like their Creator, are observing a day of rest. Thus there is a remark- 
able mutuality in the way that the myth of God's day of rest recalls the ritual of the 
Sabbath and the Sabbath ritual recalls the creation myth. 

Many of the Sabbath rituals have special meaning. It is traditional to have two challahs 
on the Sabbath. The two challahs (braided loaves of bread) represent the Israelites in the 
wilderness who collected manna on Friday for two days, for no gathering of the manna 
was permitted on the Sabbath. Another good example of the intimate link between myth 
and ritual is the reason given for the custom of eating fish on the Sabbath. This fish, it is 
said, is intended to remind us of the messianic banquet that awaits the righteous in the 
World to Come, when they will feast off of the great fish Leviathan and drink messianic 
wine saved since the six days of Creation. Once again the Sabbath and Creation are di- 
rectly linked, and this reaffirms the purpose of the Sabbath ritual, which is to remind us 
of God's six days of Creation and His subsequent day of rest. The creation of the world is 
God's greatest miracle, and remembering this reinforces the fact that we would not even 
exist without God, nor can we continue to exist without Him. Ultimately, then, the pur- 
pose of this Sabbath ritual is to give honor to God and to God's creation. 

Just as the Sabbath is welcomed on Friday night, so its departure is signaled at the end 
of the Sabbath with Havdalah, a closing ceremony that separates the Sabbath and the days 
of the week that follow. Here prayers are recited and songs sung, and certain ritual items 
are used: a braided candle, spices, and wine. These ceremonies are the ritual manifesta- 
tion of the arrival and departure of the Sabbath. However, there is also a powerful mythi- 
cal dimension to these rituals, for the arrival of the Sabbath brings with it two important 
spiritual presences, the Sabbath Queen and the neshamah yeterah, a second soul. The Sab- 
bath Queen is one of the personas of the Shekhinah, the Divine Presence, who is the Bride 
of God. The neshamah yeterah is a holy spirit that inhabits a person for the duration of the 
Sabbath. Both the Sabbath Queen and the second soul are said to take their leave when 
the Havdalah ceremony that concludes the Sabbath is performed. The ritual of smelling 
the spices that is part of Havdalah is supposed to revive a person who has just lost his or 
her extra soul. Havdalah is supposed to be performed when three stars appear in the night 
sky, but many Hasidim were reluctant to end the Sabbath, and they would delay the 
ceremony as long as possible, until well after midnight. There was even one Hasidic sect 
that put off saying Havdalah until the middle of the week, and then began at once to 
prepare for the next Sabbath. 

Thus the Sabbath can be seen as a perfect melding of myth and ritual, which, since it 
recurs on a weekly basis, serves as a religious foundation for those who observe it. It is 
truly as the essayist Ahad Ha'am said, "More than Israel has kept the Sabbath, the Sab- 
bath has kept Israel." The myth, which comes first, is the Genesis account of the six days 
of Creation, and how on the seventh day God rested. All of the elaborate traditions of the 
Sabbath, including the ritual meal using challah and wine, the Sabbath songs, and re- 
fraining from any kind of work, serve to remind us that the Sabbath is a special day, 
when the people of Israel recall God's great work of Creation, as well as the day God 
rested. The people act out the rituals that keep the myth alive, and the myth is remem- 
bered and reenacted, and the entire cycle reexperienced. 

Another important ritual in the Jewish life cycle is the saying of Kaddish, the prayer 
for the dead. This prayer is recited daily for 11 months for a deceased mother or father (B. 
RH 17a). Mourners stand to recite the prayer at the end of each prayer service, while 
facing Jerusalem. The Kaddish is also recited at the burial service, and whenever family 
members visit a grave. 



lxx INTRODUCTION 


Although the Kaddish is mentioned as one of the synagogue prayers in the Talmud, 
the practice of mourners reciting the Kaddish seems to go back to the thirteenth century. 
Over time, the Kaddish has become inextricably linked to a constellation of myths about 
the fate of the soul after death. For the Kaddish is not only a remembrance of the dead, 
but also a theurgic invocation, calling upon God to protect the soul of the one who has 
died during the time that the soul spends in Gehenna. It was the widespread Jewish 
belief that only a few pure souls went directly to Paradise after death. Acknowledging 
that everyone has his or her share of sins, it was believed that the majority of those who 
died went to Gehenna, where they were punished by avenging angels for up to one year. 
These punishments are intended to serve as a purifying process, and they are generally 
identical to those associated with the Christian concept of hell. Sinners are struck with 
flaming lashes or hung by their offending organ. But then — in contrast to the Christian 
view of hell — they are released from Gehenna and permitted to make a slow ascent into 
Paradise. This belief is explicitly stated in the Midrash: "The son's reciting of the Kaddish 
raises the soul of the parent from purgatory to paradise ." 147 

It is in this context that the Kaddish must be understood as a theurgic practice, an 
action that brings about divine intercession, here protecting the soul of the father or mother 
from the punishments of Gehenna. The prayer serves as a kind of amulet— holding back 
the forces of vengeance in the same way that an amulet protects against the Evil Eye. This 
spiritual protection is required for up to a year, the maximum time a soul spends in 
Gehenna. However, the Kaddish is recited only for eleven months, out of respect for the 
deceased, on the assumption that one's own parents were not so evil as to require the full 
twelve months of purification. Note that saying the Kaddish thus gives a compelling 
reason for mourners to be present for prayers. Indeed, the fate of a beloved parent's soul 
hangs in the balance, and the ritual of saying the Kaddish and the myth of the fate of the 
soul after death were inextricably linked. 

• Another outstanding example of a theurgic ritual is the ceremony known as Tashlikh, 
dating from the fourteenth century, which takes place during the afternoon of the first 
day of Rosh ha-Shanah. It is customary to go to the banks of a river, or any body of water, 
shaking the pockets of one's garments into the water as a symbolic way of getting rid of 
one's sins. Not only does Tashlikh serve as a symbolic purgation, but it implies that fulfill- 
ing the ritual will indeed serve to purify one's soul and free one of sin. As is the case with 
many Jewish rituals, however, there are multiple interpretations of what it means. Some 
interpret Tashlikh as a rite of transferring the sins to the fish, while others view it as a 
ritual of moral purification. Still others claim that the custom was created as a magical 
ceremony to placate the water demons . 148 While it is clear that Tashlikh presently plays a 
role of purification related to the larger observance of Rosh ha-Shanah, the implication 
that Tashlikh is also intended to placate demons shows that Jewish concerns during this 
time of judgment include the forces of evil. 

Another example of a Rosh ha-Shanah ritual with a mythic purpose is the sounding of 
the shofar. The ram's horn is blown on Rosh ha-Shanah (when all Jews are required to be 
present to hear it), in a strictly prescribed series of short and long blasts. There are many 
reasons given for this custom. One of the most fascinating of these asserts that the sound- 
ing of the shofar causes God to move from His Throne of Justice (where His judgments 
are harsh) to His Throne of Mercy (where His judgments are merciful ). 149 This interpreta- 
tion makes the shofar blowing on Rosh ha-Shanah a prime example of theurgy, since it is 
the ritual act itself that is said to make God render favorable judgment rather than any 
prayer or petition. Another explanation of this ritual is that God made up a secret lan- 
guage, that of the ram's horn, which is only understood by Him, so that the Accuser 
should not know the pleas of His children . 150 Identifying these blasts as a secret language 
is an acknowledgment that their meaning is unknown, except to God. 



INTRODUCTION lxxi 


In each of these cases, the ritual makes it possible to relive the myth and experience it 
personally This kind of living mythic experience also is found in the Passover Seder, 
where it is emphasized that "We were slaves in Egypt," rather than "They were slaves ..." 
This makes it possible to relive the Exodus, to experience the slavery, the liberation, and 
the revelation at Sinai. 

So too is the reading of the account of the Exodus at the Seder intended to recall that 
epic journey. Likewise, the use of matzah is a reminder that the Israelites in the wilderness 
did not have time to let their bread leaven, and therefore ate unleavened bread, and the 
other foods served at the Seder (ritual Passover meal) play similar roles as reminders of 
the Exodus narrative. Ultimately, then, as each of these examples indicates, ritual is in- 
tended to keep myth alive. 

It is interesting to note that some of the major Jewish holidays show clear evidence of 
having expanded their mythic origins by becoming associated with other mythical and 
historical events. The three holidays of Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot offer excellent 
examples. These were originally the three major harvest festivals in ancient Israel, and 
elements of nature continue to be demonstrated with harvest decorations such as the 
hanging of fruits and vegetables in the sukkah. They were set at the time of even more 
ancient harvest festivals, such as those of the Canaanites. It was required that all Jewish 
inhabitants journey to Jerusalem, to offer their first fruits or the firstlings of their flocks to 
be sacrificed at the Temple. Thus these three holidays were also associated with the temple 
in Jerusalem, and are linked to the temple cult. However, over time each of these holi- 
days also became associated with the Exodus from Egypt. Passover recalls the upheaval 
that preceded the Exodus, including the ten plagues, as well as the crossing of the Red 
Sea. Shavuot commemorates the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai. And Sukkot recalls 
the hasty shelters built by the Israelites during their 40 years of wandering in the wilder- 
ness. But after the destruction of the Temple and the exile of the Jewish people eliminated 
the yearly pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the associations of these three festivals became even 
more closely linked to the Exodus narrative, until it became the dominant motif. Today, 
for most Jews, each of these three holidays revolves exclusively around the myth of the 
Exodus. And the Exodus myth, as a whole, is focused on the covenant between God and 
Israel, the central myth of all of Judaism. It includes God's role, as well as that of Moses, 
in freeing the people from Egyptian bondage, in revealing the Torah on Mount Sinai, and 
in leading the people to the Holy Land. The only myth of comparable importance in 
Judaism is that of the creation of the world. Note that the rituals associated with these 
three holidays have been integrated into the lives of the people, as they are celebrated in 
a Seder at home, in the synagogue, and by eating in arborlike enclosures, known as sukkot , 
built outside a person's house. Now on Sukkot that which was once brought into the 
Temple is hung in the sukkah , and homes and synagogues are decorated with greenery 
and flowers. In this way myth and ritual reaffirm each other and, at the same time, pay 
homage to God's role in the destiny of Israel. 


V. The Light of the First Day 

The Jewish mythic tradition is unique in that it is possible to follow its evolution from the 
oral to the written tradition, and trace various stages of the written tradition. Thus a 
myth inspired by the Bible may be elaborated by the rabbis of the Talmud, as well as by 
kabbalistic and Hasidic rabbis, and versions of it might be found in the fifth century, in 
the eighth century, in the thirteenth century, in the seventeenth century and in the nine- 
teenth century. In each of these stages, there is a clearly continuing mythic development. 
Furthermore, while the myths of most cultures seem to spring into existence on their 



lxxii INTRODUCTION 


own, it is possible to trace a mythmaking process in Judaism that is closely linked to the 
method of exegesis found in rabbinic texts. This technique, what we might call the 
midrashic method, searches for answers to the problems raised in the biblical text, and, 
in the process of resolving them, creates new myths. 

A fine example of the process whereby a mythic motif is first discovered, then embel- 
lished until it achieves the status of a full myth is found in the traditions concerning the 
light of the first day. 151 Everyone is familiar with the words of Genesis 1:3, And God said , " Let 
there be light/' and there was light . But the ancient rabbis, who scrutinized the words of the 
Bible for every hidden mystery, wondered what light this was. After all, God did not create 
the sun, the moon, and the stars till the fourth day. So what was the light of the first day? 

In discussions scattered throughout rabbinic, kabbalistic, and hasidic literature, the 
rabbis consider this question. They search for clues about this mysterious light in every 
book of the Bible and find the clue they need in a prophecy of Isaiah. He speaks about 
what the world would be like in the messianic era: Moreover ; the light of the moon shall be as 
the light of the sun , and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold , as the light of the seven days (Isa. 
30:26). Here a biblical mystery is explicated right in the Bible: the light of the seven days — 
a clear reference to the primordial light — was seven times brighter than the sun. 

Drawing on Isaiah's explanation, the rabbis conclude that the two lights — that of the 
first day and that of the fourth — are different. 152 The light of the first day is a primordial 
light, what is called the or ha-ganuz, or hidden light. This resolves the problem. But it also 
raises a whole series of new questions — What was the nature of that sacred light? Where 
did it come from, and where did it go? These questions have been debated among the 
rabbis for many centuries, and they arrive at a variety of explanations. Along the way, 
they wrestle with profound questions about God and the way in which God created the 
world. What is actually happening is that a Jewish myth is taking form, a very essential 
myth about the nature of the divine and the Mysteries of Creation. Let us consider some 
of the primary permutations of this myth, which are often contradictory. 153 

First of all, where did the light come from? 

Some say that God created it at the instant He said, " Let there be light" (Gen. 1:3). Oth- 
ers say it was the light of Paradise, seven times brighter than the sun, which God brought 
into this world at the time of Creation. For the first three days and nights, it shone undi- 
minished. Rabbi Samuel Eliezer Edels, known as the Maharsha, said of this light, "The 
light that God created on the first day was the most important element of all, and for its 
sake the world was created." 

Still others say that the light existed even before the Creation. When God said, "Let there 
be light" light came forth from the place in the universe where the Temple in Jerusalem 
would one day be built. Surrounded by that light, God completed the creation of the world. 

How, then, did God bring the light into the world? 

Some say that God wrapped Himself in a prayer shawl of light, and the light cast from 
that prayer shawl suffused the world. Others say that God draped the six days of Cre- 
ation around Himself like a gown and dazzled the universe with His glory. Then there 
are those who say that God took the light and stretched it like a garment, and the heavens 
continued to expand until God said, "Enough!" Still others say that the light was cast 
from the very countenance of God. 

And where did the light go? 

There is a rabbinic debate as to how long the primordial light shone and when it was 
hidden away for the righteous in the world to come. Some say it only lasted 36 hours. 154 
Some say that it only lasted until the creation of the sun, moon, and stars on the fourth 
day, 155 while Rashi insists that it shone during the day for the entire week of the Creation. 
For those who believe it lasted till the expulsion from Eden, it was possible for Adam to 
see in that light to the ends of the universe. 


INTRODUCTION lxxiii 


The clue to the fate of the primordial light is found in a verse from the Book of Job: But 
now one does not see the light , it shines in the heavens (Job 37:21). This verse was drawn upon 
to explain that God removed the light from this world and put it in the Olam ha-Ba , the 
World to Come. There it is one of the rewards awaiting the righteous. 

A reference to the restoration of the hidden light is found in Sefer ha-Bahir: "God said, 
Tf My children keep the Torah and commandments that I gave them, one day the glow 
that was taken from the first light will be like the light itself, as it is said. It is a brilliant 
light which gives off rays on every side— and therein His glory is enveloped (Hab. 3:4).' What 
light is this? It is the light that God stored away and hid, as it is said, that You have in store 
for those who fear You (Ps. 31:20). " 156 

Some say that this sacred light pervaded the world until the very moment that Adam 
and Eve tasted the forbidden fruit. Then the first thing they lost was that precious light, 
for God, seeing the wicked deeds of the coming generations of Enosh (Gen. 5:6-11), hid 
the primordial light at once. Without it, the world grew dark around them, for the sun 
shone like a candle in comparison. Never again did they see the world in the splendor of 
that light, and that was the most painful punishment of all. Out of sympathy, God is said 
to have hidden a bit of that light inside a glowing stone, and given it to Adam and Eve 
when they were expelled from the Garden, as a reminder of all that they had lost. This 
stone, known as the Tzohar, is itself the subject of fabulous stories. 157 

* Other sources say that God was about to hide the light, but He did not, for He wanted 
to honor the Sabbath. Proof is found in the verse God blessed the seventh day (Gen. 2:3). 
What did He bless it with? With the primordial light. 

Still others say that the light was removed from the world at the time of the evil gen- 
eration of the Flood, or, some say, at the time of the generation of the separation, which 
built the Tower of Babel. 

The Zohar suggests that it was necessary for God to hide the light, for the world could 
not have endured if He had not, due to its intensity. Yet the same text suggests that even 
though the light is hidden, the world is sustained by it and that every day something of 
this light emerges into the world and renews the work of Creation. 158 

By now, most of the questions have been addressed — What was the light? Where did it 
come from? Where did it go? But still unanswered is one of the most important questions — 
did God create the primordial light or did it pre-exist? This question delves into the myster- 
ies of Creation, and in rabbinic and kabbalistic circles it was believed that these kinds of 
questions could undermine monotheism. The advice of the Mishnah is to avoid them: 
"Whoever gives his mind to four things, it would have been better if he had not been 
bom — What is above? What is below? What came before? And what will come after?" 159 
Despite this warning, the talmudic rabbis and all of their successors delved deeply into 
these questions, even when it brought them to the brink of Jewish gnosticism, that is, to the 
implication that God may have been assisted in the creation of the world. 

Take that light that was said to exist in the place where the Temple would be built in 
future generations. It suggests some kind of primordial force in the universe, which God 
drew upon in Creation. God chose to place the earth where He did because of that light. 
For the same reason, God placed the Holy Land where He did because of that light, and 
He placed the site of the Temple in Jerusalem at the very source of that light. The myth 
goes on to say that this holy light continued to emanate even after the Temple was built 
in that place. Its source was in the Holy of Holies, and it lit up the Temple and shone forth 
through the windows and filled the Holy Land. 

Beneath the surface, questions about the origin of this light seek to know whether any- 
thing else existed before God created the world, whether God drew upon such pre-existing 
elements or created everything out of nothing, whether God had any assistance in Creation, 
and even the unthinkable question of who created God. These kinds of questions posed the 
danger of undermining monotheism. As noted, the advice of the Mishnah was to avoid them. 



lxxiv INTRODUCTION 


There is no satisfactory account of the creation of light in the book of Genesis, none 
that specifies whether this tight pre-existed or was created at that instant by God. Even 
great commentators such as Rashi and his grandson. Rabbi Samuel ben Meir, known as 
Rashbam, agreed that no such full account is given. Perhaps the tight pre-existed or per- 
haps God brought it into being during an earlier creation, one not recounted in Genesis. 
Neither of these solutions supports the notion of creation ex nihilo, and anything else 
suggests limits of God's powers, which, by definition, are limitless. 

The most common explanation for what happened to the primordial li gh t is that God 
hid it for the righteous in the World to Come. But in the thirteenth century the Zohar sug- 
gested another explanation: "Whenever the Torah is studied at night, a single ray comes 
from the hidden tight and stretches forth to those who study ." 160 Drawing on this clue in the 
eighteenth century, the Ba'al Shem Tov, founder of Hasidism, proposed that God had hid- 
den the primordial tight in the Torah, and for those who immerse themselves in the study 
of the Torah, a ray of that tight would shine forth, and past and future and time and space 
would open up for a moment, and they would experience the revelation of the hidden 
tight, and see the world as God saw it when God said, "Let there be light. " m This interpreta- 
tion is reinforced by midrashim that explain that the original tablets of the Law that Moses 
received on Mount Sinai were created in the presence of the primordial tight. Thus it might 
be said that this sacred tight was imprinted on the pages of the Torah. 

Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, the greatest Jewish storyteller, who also happened to be 
the great-grandson of the Ba'al Shem Tov, agreed with his great-grandfather's explana- 
tion of where the tight was hidden. But he added that it was hidden in the stories of the 
Torah. Rabbi Nachman truly loved stories and found them full of hidden tight: "Every 
story has something that is concealed. What is concealed is the hidden tight. The Book of 
Genesis says that God created tight on the first day, the sun on the fourth. What tight 
existed before the sun? The tradition says this was spiritual tight and that God hid it for 
future use. Where was it hidden? In the stories of the Torah ." 162 

That might have been the end of the story, but it's not. Another nineteenth century 
rabbi. Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Riminov, insisted that the primordial tight had never 
been hidden at all, and was still present, but that only the truly righteous could see it. It 
is invisible to everyone else. On the other hand, in the twentieth century Rabbi Abraham 
Joshua Heschel accepted the hiddenness of the primordial tight and drew his own con- 
clusions from it: "The primordial tight is hidden. Had the Torah demanded perfection, 
[the world] would have remained a utopia. The laws of the Torah ask of each generation 
to fulfill what is within its power to fulfill. Some of its laws . . . do not represent ideals but 
compromises, realistic attempts to refine the moral condition of ancient man ." 163 

Thus the Bible begins with a mysterious tight, considered distinct from that of the 
fourth day of Creation, which God brings into the world as a sacred, primordial tight. In 
some versions of the myth God removes the tight and saves it for the righteous in the 
World to Come. In others, God hides it in the Torah, where it is waiting to be found. In 
still others, it has been here all along, for those who are capable of seeing it. 


VI. The Continuing Evolution of Jewish Mythology 

The primary myths of Judaism are found in the Hebrew Bible, in the stories of Creation, of 
the Garden of Eden, the Tower of Babel, tire great Flood, the covenant with Abraham, the 
parting of the Red Sea, the Exodus, and the Giving of the Torah. And these are only the 
major biblical myths. Because of the looming presence of the Bible in Western culture, these 
myths are encountered, in literary allusions and in other ways, on almost a daily basis. 

In terms of mythic evolution, it is important to remember that even these biblical myths 
were themselves based on earlier oral versions. Here the transition from the oral tradi- 


INTRODUCTION lxxv 


tion to a written one was influenced by the priestly editors of the books of the Torah. 
What were these long lost prebiblical myths like? They may well have been considerably 
different than the written versions we are familiar with. 

Sir James Frazer speculated that the original oral myth about the Garden of Eden was 
not about a Tree of Knowledge and a Tree of Life, as found in Genesis, because they are 
not a polar pair. 164 Myths repeatedly seek out polarities whenever possible — day and 
night, sun and moon, heaven and earth. It would be unlikely that the original myth had 
two trees that were not polar, as is the case with the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life. 
Rather, Frazer suggests, the two trees were likely the Tree of Life and the Tree of Death. 165 
According to his theory, God gave Adam and Eve a divine test to determine if mankind 
would be mortal or immortal. God wanted them to be immortal, 166 so He gave them a big 
hint: "Don't eat from the Tree of Death!" Of course, human nature being what it is, that is 
exactly what they did, thus becoming mortal. If the fruit that Adam and Eve had first 
tasted had been from the Tree of Life, they would have lived forever, but having eaten 
from the Tree of Death, they could no longer be permitted access to the Tree of Life. That 
is why God stationed east of the garden of Eden the cherubim and the fiery ever-turning sword , 
to guard the way to the Tree of Life (Gen. 3:24). If Frazer is correct — and his theory has the 
ring of truth— it suggests that the original purpose of the myth, to provide the origin of 
death, was replaced by a shift to ethical issues, seeing the events of the Fall primarily as 
a sin against God. This would indicate that this biblical myth was considerably changed 
from its oral version when the text of Genesis was edited. 167 

After they were written down, the biblical myths, especially the myths of the Torah, 
were themselves reimagined and embellished in every generation by a process of cre- 
ative plenitude, whereby themes and motifs were further elaborated. 168 It might seem 
that Jewish mythology is drawn exclusively from these biblical sources, but that is not 
the case. One of the most remarkable aspects of the mythology of Judaism is that it con- 
tinued to evolve long after most mythologies had taken their final form. In most cultures 
the development of myth occurs during an early period, long before it is written down. 
However, once committed to writing, the mythical narrative generally remains fixed. But 
Jewish tradition has not followed this pattern. That is because Judaism recognizes both a 
written and an oral tradition. The Written Torah consists of the Five Books of Moses and 
is recorded in the scroll of the Torah. The Oral Law is the oral commentary linked to it. As 
one midrash puts it, God gave the Torah to Moses during the day and explained it to him 
at night. 169 And whenever a question arises as to the authority of a statement out of the 
Oral Law, it is ultimately attributed to the explanations of the Law that Moses received at 
Mount Sinai: "This is Torah from Moses at Sinai." 

The primary themes announced in the earliest Jewish texts became the focus of later 
texts that strove to be true to the original myth while adding their own imprint. As a 
result it is also possible to trace the evolution of seminal Jewish myths from the earliest 
period not only to the Hasidic era of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but even to 
the present, where myths have been among the kinds of oral tales collected by Jewish 
ethnologists in Eastern Europe and in Israel. No other world mythology has been docu- 
mented so thoroughly while undergoing such an extensive evolution. 

The varied periods of Jewish religion are characterized by their own predominant 
myths. Yet there is a continuity among them that is reflected in the rabbinic axiom that 
"there is no earlier or later in the Torah." Commenting on this statement. Rabbi Shlomo 
ben Yitzhak ha-Levi adds: "That is to say, every part of it is both first and last like a 
sphere . . . and where it ends, there it begins, for behold it is like a circle or a sphere." 170 
This principle is certainly reflected in the midrashic method of drawing on one episode 
in the Bible, such as the childhood of Moses, to fill in a narrative gap in another, such as 
the missing childhood of Abraham. This results in a distinctly myth-making process, 
which contributes in no small part to the ongoing mythic evolution. 171 


lxxvi INTRODUCTION 


There are two factors, in particular, that enable mythic elaboration in Judaism. One is the 
existence of the Oral Law, and the other is what might be called "the midrashic method." 
The Oral Law contains a great many details and explanations about the Written Torah, as 
well as alternate versions of biblical narratives. The midrashic method searches for hints 
and explanations of the biblical text to resolve apparent contradictions and complete unfin- 
ished narratives. To accomplish this, it uses many techniques, such as examining the roots 
of words, drawing on earlier or later portions of the text (the chapters before and after are 
always considered relevant), or using the purest kind of invention to resolve a knotty prob- 
lem. Of course this invention is attributed to the Oral Torah, and therefore is regarded as 
legitimate. 

To better understand the kind of transformations that take place in Jewish mythology, 
let us consider a few examples. Perhaps the most striking transformation is that of the 
concept of the Shekhinah, as discussed earlier. From around the fifth century to the twelfth 
or thirteenth century, the concept changed from being a synonym for God and God's 
presence in the world to denoting the Bride of God, a figure with many of the qualities of 
a goddess. 

Extensive mythic transformations are also associated with the figure of Lilith. In the 
early medieval Alphabet of Ben Sira Lilith is identified as Adam's first wife, who resisted 
having sex in the missionary position, abandoned Adam and the Garden of Eden, and 
took up residence at the Red Sea, where she took for lovers all the male demons who 
made their home there. But by the Middle Ages the focus on Lilith in Jewish folklore was 
on her role as the Queen of Demons, while, at the same time, Lilith took on the role of the 
dark feminine in kabbalah, the feminine aspect of the Sitra Ahra, the Other Side, the polar 
opposite of the Shekhinah. It is interesting to note that the transformations of Lilith seem 
to have continued in our own time, in which Lilith has been portrayed as a role model by 
some Jewish feminists. 

The kinds of changes in the Lilith myth that have taken place since the 1960s, which 
have transformed Lilith from being regarded as an evil demoness, succubus, and child- 
destroying witch into a model of sexual and personal independence, raise the important 
question of what role Jewish mythology plays for modern, non-Orthodox Jews. The 
changes cut two ways. On the one hand, the belief in these myths as an expression of 
literal truth has largely vanished, along with the belief that contemporary rabbis can 
draw upon God's powers to ascend to Paradise or confront forces of evil. On the other 
hand, certain myths, in particular those about Lilith, the Shekhinah, and the golem (a 
humanoid created through kabbalistic sorcery), have taken on great popularity, and have 
shown distinct signs of new life. The attraction of Lilith for Jewish feminists derives from 
her independence from Adam, especially her sexual independence. She serves as a com- 
pelling figure of female rebellion in a patriarchal tradition. 172 At the same time, the exist- 
ence of the traditions about the Shekhinah is regarded by many modern Jewish women as 
an indication that there is a place for the feminine in Judaism, beginning with the very 
concept of God, and new prayers and customs have been created to emphasize this de- 
velopment. Thus, even if these myths are not accepted as absolute truths, they have gen- 
erated widespread interest in Jewish and non-Jewish circles. Of course, the kinds of 
changes in the perception of these myths indicate that the evolution of Jewish mythology 
has continued into our own time. The very fact of this continued evolution speaks vol- 
umes about the vitality of Jewish myth. 

The examples of the changing roles of the Shekhinah and of Lilith indicate that Jewish 
myths can develop in unexpected directions. But sometimes what happens is that a frag- 
mentary myth takes on a life of its own. This is what happened with Enoch, who receives 
a brief mention in the genealogical listing between Adam and Noah, where it is said that 



INTRODUCTION lxxvii 


Enoch walked with God ; then he was no more, for God took him (Gen. 21:24). This brief passage 
about Enoch, which was understood to mean that Enoch was taken alive into paradise, 
became the basis of the extensive Enoch myth first found in 1 Enoch (second century bce 
through first century ce), where Enoch ascends on high. The myth was expanded in 2 
Enoch (first century) and 3 Enoch (fifth through sixth century), the latter describing how 
Enoch was transformed into the fiery angel Metatron. 

Perhaps the most common kind of mythic evolution involves narrative development, 
especially completing unfinished narratives. For example, the biblical story of Cain is 
missing an ending. Cain was the first murderer, and the rabbis wanted to see in his death 
an example of divine justice. But the last we hear of Cain in Genesis, he has founded a 
city. Nothing is said of his death. But in the midrashic texts several versions of Cain's 
death are to be found. In one Cain is transformed into the Angel of Death. In another, 
Cain's stone house collapses on him during an earthquake, thus causing him to be stoned 
to death, an appropriate punishment, as death by stoning was the punishment for capital 
crimes. In a third version Cain was killed by Lamech and Tubal-Cain, his descendants. 
Thus, just as Cain murdered a relative, he was killed by relatives, making this version 
another example of divine justice. 173 

Drawing on this extensive oral tradition, which reached back a thousand years, the 
rabbis proceeded to reimagine the Bible, and in the process substantially developed its 
mythic elements. Clues were sought and found in biblical verses, and these were also 
used to resolve problems in the biblical text. Using these methods, details about the lives 
of the patriarchs and matriarchs accrued, as well as details of realms such as heaven and 
hell, and these details were themselves subject to further embellishment. 

Thus it is possible to witness the actual evolution of Jewish myths. Early myths, pri- 
marily those found in the Bible, were embellished in the oral tradition and later recorded 
in the rabbinic texts. The Talmud, dating from the fifth century, is believed to be the 
written form of the Oral Torah, and additional oral traditions are recorded in the midrashic 
texts that followed. These rabbinic myths were themselves transformed in the kabbalistic 
and hasidic periods. The most fertile periods of development took place between the first 
and fifth centuries, when the Talmud and most of the texts of the Pseudepigrapha were 
written, and between the thirteenth and seventeenth centuries, the primary period of 
kabbalistic literature. The latter is a remarkably late period in human history for such 
extensive mythic development. It is then that major myths of the nature of God and of 
His Bride took form, along with further myths of creation and of the Messiah. But in 
every case these kabbalistic myths are rooted in earlier sources and undergo a process of 
evolution until they achieve full expression. 

If we search for an overriding pattern in this mythic evolution, we can recognize an 
early fascination with heavenly journeys, as well as with the mysteries of Creation and 
the mysteries of God's Chariot. Beginning in the Middle Ages, the role of the long-sup- 
pressed feminine aspect of God emerges as an increasingly dominant theme, especially 
in the goddesslike role of the Shekhinah and in the fascination and fear engendered by the 
Lilith myth. In both the earlier and later periods, the longing for the coming of the Mes- 
siah remains constant, as does the centrality of the Torah and its teachings. In our own 
time, when women have sought a greater role in all aspects of Jewish life, they have 
found role models in the figures of Lilith and the Shekhinah rather than in the traditional 
role models, the matriarchs. Consistent throughout, however, has been the bond created 
by the covenant of God and His people, Israel. This is the central myth of Judaism, and it 
is the key to understanding all the others. 


lxxviii INTRODUCTION 


Notes 

1 This is found in Zohar 3:167a-b, where Jacob's granddaughter, Serah bat Asher, is described as 
one of the blessed women who teaches Torah to the souls of righteous women in her own heav- 
enly palace. See "Women in Paradise," p. 190. 

2 "Shekhinah while not a biblical term, has a biblical basis in the term shokhen ("dwells"), which 
occurs in many places in the Bible, stating that God "dwells" on earth, as in Psalm 135:21, Blessed 
is the Lord from Zion, He who dwells in Jerusalem. In the Bible God is variously described as dwelling 
in the Tabernacle, in the Temple, and among the people of Israel. In rabbinic literature, " Shekhinah " 
refers to God's presence, i.e. dwelling, in this world. By the kabbalistic era, this term had evolved 
to refer to the feminine aspect of God, also identified as God's Bride. 

3 There is considerable scholarly controversy over whether Asherah was a goddess in pre-exilic 
Israel; whether, in fact, Asherah was Yahweh's divine consort. Much revolves around the inter- 
pretation of a number of biblical passages, especially 1 Kings 18:19, where Elijah refers to four 
hundred prophets of Asherah. Other key passages are 2 Kings 21:7, 2 Kings 23:4, Judges 3:7, and 
Jeremiah 2:27. Also, Asherah appears as an Israelite phenomenon in the polemics found in Judges 
2:13 and 10:6, and 1 Samuel 7:3-4 and 12:10. There are also references in Jeremiah 7:18 and 44:15-28 
that refer to the "Queen of Heaven," a figure some identify with Asherah. So too does the refer- 
ence to the "asherahs" in Judges 3:7 seem to indicate the presence of the goddess in ancient Israel, 
with the asherah, a wooden cult object, as her symbol. See The Early History of God by Mark Smith, 
pp. 125-133. See also "Israel and the Mothers" by Michael Fishbane in The Garments of Torah: Es- 
says in Biblical Hermeneutics , pp. 49-63, and In the Wake of the Goddesses: Women , Culture , and the 
Biblical Transformation of Pagan Myth by Tikva Frymer-Kensky, pp. 153-161. Arguing strongly that 
Asherah was Yahweh's consort is The Hebrew Goddess , 3 rd edition, by Raphael Patai, pp. 34-53. 

4 Genesis Rabbah 8: 7. See "The Council of Souls," p. 160. Note that there is a strong biblical echo 
of the Council of Souls in Psalm 89:7-8, which depicts God as the head of a council of other gods, 
which are referred to as kedoshim , i.e., "holy ones": For who in the skies can equal the Lord , can compare 
with the Lord among the divine beings , a God greatly dreaded in the council of holy beings, held in awe by all 
around him? In rabbinic literature the Council of Souls seems to have been replaced by the idea of 
the heavenly court, consisting of angels. In the Talmud, it is clearly stated that "God does nothing 
without consulting His heavenly court." Thus the tradition of the Council of Souls may well have 
been replaced by that of the heavenly court, which is less threatening in that its members consist 
of angels rather than other divinities. Nevertheless, God continues to consult it, something one 
would not expect of an all-powerful God. 

5 Note that the definition of "mythology" offered here does not attempt to determine if biblical 
or subsequent narratives are true or false, i.e., historically accurate or not. And, emphatically, the 
use of the word "myth" is not offered to mean something that is not true, as in the current popular 
usage.

s Sefer ha-Zikhronot. See The Chronicles ofjerahmeel, edited by Moses Gaster. While Sefer ha-Zikhronot 
dates from the late Middle Ages, the basic tradition about ten things that had a kind of "special 
creation" is already found in the Mishnah, in Avot 5:9, dating from the second century. This in- 
volves a different list, and they are said to have been created at dusk on the sixth day of Creation 
rather than prior to the Creation. But the basic idea is there. Also, some talmudic sources list 
seven things created before the Creation of the world. See "Seven Things Created Before the Cre- 
ation of the World," p. 74. There are also ten utterances of God employed to bring the world into 
being (B. Avot 5:1). 

9 Each of the ten things that "rose up in the thought" of God represents one of the ten mythic 
categories: Jerusalem=Myths of the Holy Land; the souls of the patriarchs=Myths of Heaven; the 
ways of the righteous=Myths of the Holy People; Gehenna=Myths of Hell; the Flood=Myths of 
Exile; the stone tablets=Myths of the Holy Word; the Sabbath=Myths of the Holy Time; the 
Temple=Myths of Creation (as the location of the Temple was the starting point of creation); the 
Ark=Myths of God ; the light of the world to come=Myths of the Messiah.

19 This verse is usually rendered, "I am the Lord your God," where "the Lord" replaces YHVH, the 
primary name of God, which is rendered in English as Yahweh. Traditionally, it was forbidden to 
pronounce YHVH, so Adonai (God) or ha-Shem (the Name) are used instead. However, these sub- 
stitutions obscure Yahweh's mythic identity, and thus they are a part of the demythologizing 
trend in Judaism. In this book both "Yahweh" and "the Lord" have been used to translate YHVH.

24 Many scholars have detected a strong Gnostic strain in Sabbatianism, the version of Judaism 
propounded by Shabbatai Zevi, the seventeenth century messianic pretender, and his followers. Lurianic 
kabbalah, which itself has a Gnostic strain, was the intellectual background of the Sabbatian move- 
ment. For Abraham Cardozo, one of the most prominent Sabbatians, the Creator-God of Judaism is an 
entity distinct from the Supreme Being ("First Cause"), and inferior to the Supreme Being. This is not 
far removed from the Gnostic view that the God of the Hebrew scriptures is the evil demiurge, distinct 
from a higher God who is good. However, for Cardozo, the lesser being is the one who is truly God, 
and that ought to be worshipped. Cardozo's doctrine is of a limited God, requiring human assistance 
and susceptible to near-death and rebirth. See Sabbatai Sevi by Gershom Scholem and Abraham Miguel 
Cardozo: Selected Writings, translated by David J. Halperin, especially pp. 64-67. 

25 Meor Enayim. Here the Shekhinah is identified as Knesset Yisrael, the Community of Israel, 
which is one of the many names of the Shekhinah . See footnote 27, p. lxxix for a discussion of these 
names. This Hasidic text is a commentary on Zohar 3:93a, which speaks of how God and the 
Community of Israel are separated, and quotes Zechariah 14:9 to describe how their reunion will 
restore God's wholeness: In that day there shall be one Lord, and His name one. And the Zohar adds: 
"But one without the other is not called one." Of course, since Knesset Israel also refers to the 
people of Israel, this also suggests a marriage between God (the Groom) and the People of Israel 
(the Bride). In fact, both readings are correct, so closely bound are the identities and fates of the 
Shekhinah and the people of Israel. They are perceived not as two entities, but two faces of the 
same entity. See "The Wedding of God and Israel," p. 305. 

26 B. Sota 17a. 

27 In the index of his book, The Sabbath in the Classical Kabbalah , pp. 334-336, Elliot K. Ginsburg lists 
79 symbolic identities associated with the Shekhinah , including Ark, bed. Bride, candle, chamber. 
Community of Israel, darkened mirror, darkness, daughter, diadem, dove, field, flame, garden, gate, 
heart. Holy of Holies, Jerusalem, moon, mother, princess, queen, rose. Sabbath, sister, soul, spring, 
Tabernacle, temple, throne, tree, well, and womb. The extensive nature of this list reveals the indis- 
pensable role of the Shekhinah in kabbalistic thought. For the famous allegory of the Shekhinah as a 
lovely maiden in a palace, see Zohar 2:98b-99a. For the allegory of the hind, see Zohar 3:249a-249b.

32 See Hayim Vital: Sha'arei Kedushah 3, Sha'ar ha-Gilgulim, Introduction 2, and Sefer ha-Gilgulim 
5. Vital defines possession by ibbur as follows: "If a person does his utmost to purify himself, so 
that the very root of his soul is revealed to him, he may become impregnated with the soul of a 
Tzaddik, living or dead, who will help him to completely transcend himself. For examples of ibbur 
tales, see "A Kiss from the Master" in Gabriel's Palace: Jewish Mystical Tales , pp. 79-80 and "The

^Biblical monotheism is often described as "exclusive monotheism," meaning that it denies 
the existence or at least the relevance of any deities other than the One. David J. Halperin suggests 
that the Greeks also had a monotheism, which he calls "inclusive monotheism," in which the 
Many are acknowledged as legitimate aspects of the One. Halperin suggests that the Kabbalah is 
a form of "inclusive monotheism," in which the Many are the sefirot, and the "One" is the deity 
whom the sefirot define. This provides a clue to the nature of monotheistic mythology in Judaism, 
at least as far as the kabbalah goes. 

^In Zohar 1:22a this myth is described in terms of the interaction of the sefirot: the Shekhinah , identi- 
fied as the sefirah Malkkut, is reunited with the male aspect of God, identified by the sefirah Tiferet. This 
is a typical example of the kind of sefirotic interaction that kabbalists regard as underlying every 
mythic process, especially those involving God and the Shekhinah. Discussion of these sefirotic pro- 
cesses has been kept to a minimum in this book, which focuses instead on the interaction of divine 
figures and forces from a mythic perspective. Note that the sefirotic view of these processes largely 
eliminates their mythic dimension and transforms them into the interaction of divine emanations 
(although it could be argued that divine emanations are themselves mythic). For kabbalists, the mythic 
and sefirotic views were considered equally valid, and they were permitted to exist simultaneously.

M In Gnosticism, a highly dualistic doctrine that flourished in the early centuries ce, this world 
is the creation of a lower, evil deity, known as the "demiurge," who functions both as a Creator- 
God and World-ruler. Above this deity there is a remote, benevolent Deity, superior to the demiurge 
and to the demiurge's flawed and evil creation, a Deity whom the Gnostics perceived as the source 
of the human soul and the only hope for salvation. In Plato's Timaeus , the demiurge is the "arti- 
san" (what the Greek word literally means), who created this perfect cosmos. To the Gnostics, the 
cosmos is evil, and therefore the demiurge /creator is evil. The "good" God in Gnosticism, who is 
opposed to the demiurge, is an extracosmic deity, who comes to redeem the human soul from 
bondage. Accounts of ruling figures such as Metatron in Jewish tradition indicate a Gnostic influ- 
ence, where God represents the good, higher God, and Metatron (or another ruling figure) repre- 
sents a demiurgic figure. Indeed, Metatron is sometimes identified as the "lesser Yahweh." Yet, 
while there is clear evidence, especially in the Dead Sea Scrolls and the some of the texts of the 
Pseudepigrapha, such as The Book of Jubilees and The Testaments of the Patriarchs , of Gnostic think- 
ing in Judaism, it is important to recognize that Gnosticism requires that the Demiurge be evil, 
and this is not the case in Judaism. Also, in some non-Jewish Gnostic sects, the God of the Hebrew 
Scriptures is identified as the evil demiurge, and His commandments the arbitrary rules of an 
enslaving tyrant — a doctrine deemed heretical by the Christian Church. For more information on 
Gnosticism and its many permutations, see Gnosticism by Hans Jonas. For the relationship of Gnos- 
ticism to Judaism, see Alexander Altmann, "The Gnostic Background of the Rabbinic Adam Leg- 
ends" in his Essays in Jewish Intellectual History , pp. 1-16. For the primary Gnostic texts see James 
M. Robinson, ed.. The Nag Hammadi Library: A Translation of the Gnostic Scriptures.

40 The two roots of kabbalah are Ma'aseh Bereshit, the Mysteries of Creation, i.e., the study of 
Creation as presented in Genesis, and Ma'aseh Merkavah, the Mysteries of the Chariot, i.e., the 
study of Ezekiel's vision in the first chapter of the Book of Ezekiel. 

41 Although most of these enthronement myths are found in the Pseudepigrapha — thus outside 
the official teachings of Judaism — some of them, such as those about Metatron and Jacob, derive 
from standard rabbinic sources. See "The Enthronement of Adam," p. 131, "The Metamorphosis

57 There are also special punishments awaiting those so evil that their souls are not permitted to 
descend to Gehenna in the first place. These punishments include the eternal wandering of a 
wicked soul, forever chased by avenging angels, or the transmigration of especially evil souls into 
various beasts. Evil souls who attempt to escape this fate sometimes enter into the body of a 
living person and take possession as a dybbuk that must be exorcised. See S. Ansky's folk drama.

92 The word translated as "punishment" is actually avoni, "my sin." If read literally, Cain is 
saying that his sin is too great to bear, meaning that he recognizes the extent of his sin. While the 
biblical account of Cain describes his exile, Genesis Rabbah 22:13 and Leviticus Rabbah 10:5 report 
that Cain repented and his repentance was accepted by God. Adam was so surprised to learn this 
that he slapped his head and cried out, "If I had only known the power of repentance." 

93 This biblical recounting does not include the Babylonian exile that took place after the first 
Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed in 586 bce, nor again when the second Temple was destroyed in 
70 C.E., nor the exile that took place after the expulsion from Spain in 1492, nor the destruction and 
wandering of the Jews of Europe in the Second World War, as well as hundreds of other examples. 
Exile, it seems, has been the fate of the Jewish people.

95 See "Exile and Redemption in Jewish Thought in the Sixteenth Century: Contending Concep- 
tions" by Shalom Rosenberg, pp. 399-430. There is also evidence that the idea of a nonpunishment 
purpose of exile arose even earlier than the sixteenth century. Rosenberg cites precedents on pp. 
407-410. These include the view that the purpose of the exile was to gain proselytes.

"In Mishneh Torah Hillchot Melakhim 11 Maimonides offers a naturalistic alternative to the su- 
pernatural view of these requirements: "King Messiah will arise and restore the kingdom of David 
to its former glory. He will rebuild the Temple and gather all the exiles of Israel. All ancient laws 
will be reinstituted in his days; sacrifices will again be offered; the Sabbatical and Jubilee years 
will again be observed according to the commandments set forth in the Law." Note that Maimonides 



INTRODUCTION lxxxiii 


specifically excludes the raising of the dead. On the other hand, he includes the reinstitution of all 
the ancient laws, including those no longer in use, such as those pertaining to the Temple, for once 
the Temple is rebuilt, the laws concerning sacrifices will be renewed. This perspective of the role 
of the Messiah reflects the view of a third century talmudic sage, Samuel, found in B. Pesahim 68a, 
that there is no difference between historical time and messianic time except that the Jewish people 
will no longer be politically oppressed. 

im Zohar l:22a-b, 2:175a, 3:69a. See "The Exile of the Shekhinah," p. 75, and the accompanying 
note. 

101 There is a somewhat obscure tradition about a third Messiah, known as the Priest Messiah. 
This tradition grows out of the biblical phrase, Kohen ha-Mashiah , priest Messiah, which refers to 
the anointed priest. But the rabbis later took it to mean that there is a third Messiah who comes 
before the other two Messiahs. Some traditions identify this priest Messiah with Elijah, since 
Elijah's role includes being harbinger of the messianic age. 

102 For a good article on the two Messiahs, see "The Messiah of Ephraim and the Premature 
Exodus of the Tribe of Ephraim" by J. Heinemann. 

103 See Ezekiel 38-39. In apocalyptic Jewish literature, the war of Gog and Magog becomes iden- 
tified as a war against God that will bring great calamities on Israel. It will be the final war, which 
will presage the advent of the Messiah.

110 About half of all Lubavitch Hasidim are said to share the belief that their deceased Rebbe 
will be resurrected and fulfill the role of the Messiah, although traditional messianic doctrine 
holds that all of the righteous dead will be resurrected at the same time. This, then, appears to be 
an example of a new myth of individual resurrection developing among these Hasidim. David 
Berger has written a highly critical book about this evolving belief, The Rebbe , the Messiah , and the 
Scandal of Orthodox Indifference. 

m Two other key questions may also be intuited here: First, why was the world created? The 
answer most often given is so that the universe and everything in it could praise God. Second, 
why was man created? In a well-known midrash, a group of angels questions God's intention to 
create man, asking, "What is man that You have been mindful of him?" (Ps. 8:5). In reply, God stretched 
out His little finger and consumed them with fire. The same thing happened with a second group 
of angels. The third group of angels agreed it was a wonderful idea. See B. Sanhedrin 38b.

ping other gods is found in 2 Kings 17:7-23 and Jeremiah 25:3-11. 

116 There is another instance of monolatry in the ancient Near East. The Egyptian Pharaoh 
Akhenaton inaugurated a solar monolatry in the fourteenth century bce, in which the royal family 
worshipped Aton, the disk of the sun, to the exclusion of all of the other Egyptian gods. 

117 This verse is part of the famous prayer, Mi-Kemokhah ("Who is like you?"), which is recited as 
part of the second blessing after the Shema. The ba-elim are generally understood to be the gods of 
the idol worshippers.

wrote about biblical religion, had the theory that there were two Judaisms, the Judaism presented 
by the priestly editors of the Bible, where pagan elements were forbidden, and the actual way the 
religion was practiced by the people. In this folk religion, many motifs found in Babylonian and 
Canaanite mythology found their way into Judaism. 



lxxxiv INTRODUCTION 


119 Of course, the rabbinic texts themselves claim that these traditions are part of the Oral Torah, 
handed down by God to Moses at Mount Sinai, and are therefore considerably ancient.

the Babylonian myth of Marduk and Tiamat. 

121 The Shekhinah , originally simply the "divine presence," evolved into the feminine "aspect" 
of the one (primarily male) God. In medieval kabbalah, the Shekhinah is identified with the sefirah 
known as Malkhut, counterbalancing the higher, masculine sefirot. In Jewish myth the Shekhinah is 
often identified as God's Bride, and in this respect functions like divine spouses in other religious 
systems. To the extent that the Shekhinah seems to take on a kind of independent existence. Her 
role may be considered as parallel to that of goddesses in polytheistic religions.

144 In the Middle Ages, when no Jew would call into question the divine origin of the Torah, the 
test of faith was whether one believed that the waters of the Red Sea had truly parted. Anyone 
who doubted this was open to possession by evil spirits, known as dybbuks, which then required 
exorcism. See, for example, "The Widow of Safed," p. 228. 

145 This also hints that some of the rituals and laws contained in the Torah were already ob- 
served by the Israelites before the Torah was given at Mount Sinai. This seems to suggest that the 
Torah was not an entirely new revelation, but incorporated elements of existing traditions.

ences as to how the Tabernacle was built. See B. Shabbat 73a-75b.

147 This belief may derive from an early story about Rabbi Akiba rescuing a man's soul from

identical with the one in which it is now still observed" dates to the fourteenth century, but that 
"the ceremony itself" is much older, dating from Hellenistic times.

from the light of the first day. Ephraem, in Genesim Commentarii 9:2. Philo also identifies the 
primordial light, which he describes as invisible and perceptible only by mind, as the source of 
starlight. Philo, De Opificio Mnndi 31 and 55. 

153 The kinds of permutations presented here are of a mythic nature. While this represents one 
perspective, the myth of the or ha-ganuz (hidden light) also can be identified as one of the sefirotic 
myths. From this perspective, the primordial light is identified with the sefirah of Hesed, the first to 
emerge from Binah. See Zohar 1:20a; 2:137a, and 2:166b. For other examples of sefirotic myths, see 
"The Seven Forms of God," p. 53 and "The Ten Crowns of God," p. 9. 

154 Rabbi Eleazer of Worms (1165-1230) describes a Hanukkah ritual, which he attributes to the

shone.

165 See Theodor H. Gaster's Myth, Legend, and Custom in the Old Testament , p. 33, which updates

Word: Ancient Israelite Literature by Susan Niditch. For an example of a myth making use of the 
identification of the Tree of Knowledge as the Tree of Death, see "Abraham's Tree," p. 404. 

166 As proof that God intended Adam to be immortal. Genesis Rabbah 21:5 states that "Adam was 
not meant to experience death." In Avodat ha-Kodesh 27, Rabbi Meir ibn Gabbai states that "God 
intended for Adam to live forever." According to one interpretation, God created Adam intending 
that he would be one of the eternal beings. Just as Elijah was taken into heaven alive, so was 
Adam intended to have eternal life. However, when he tasted the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, 
Adam lost his right to immortality, and that is why God placed the Cherubim at the gate of the 
Garden of Eden with the flaming sword, to guard the way to the Tree of Life . (Gen. 3:24). Note, 
however, that there is an alternate interpretation of the statement that "Adam was not meant to 
experience death." According to this reading, Adam never died and still exists. This would place 
Adam in the category of the great figures who never died. This includes Enoch, Abraham, Jacob, 
Moses, King David, and Elijah. See "Abraham Never Died" p. 348 and "Jacob Never Died," p. 370. 

167 According to Gershom Scholem, the earliest rabbinic identification of the Tree of Knowledge 
and the Tree of Death is found in Midrash Konen. Zohar 1:35b and 1:37b also directly link the two

trees. Zohar 1:35b states that "It is a Tree of Death, for if anyone takes from it he will die, for he 
takes the elixir of death." Zohar 1:37b describes the Tree of Knowledge as "the tree which has a 
connection to death." See Zohar 3:11a for a myth about how the Tree of Death rules at night. See 
"Abraham's Tree," p. 404. 

168 This kind of mythic evolution in Judaism seems to confirm Carl Jung's theory of myth being 
drawn from the collective unconscious. See Jung's The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious

172 This might be an appropriate time for someone to study the use of the Lilith myth by Jewish 
feminists in the 1960s, in order to create a rebellious model. It might be viewed as an intentional 
reworking of a negative feminine myth into a positive one. What is interesting is that for many 
modern Jewish women, Lilith is viewed as a positive figure, despite her long history as a succubus 
as well as a child-strangling witch. They have chosen to select some positive features, of sexual 
and personal independence, and suppress the negative ones. This leaves Lilith with a lot of bag- 
gage. For a contemporary collection of writings about Lilith, see Which Lilith? Feminist Writers Re-

COD'S THRONE OF CLORY 


1. ISAIAH'S VISION 

In the year that King Uzziah died, I beheld my Lord seated on a high and lofty throne; 
and the skirts of His robe filled the Temple. Seraphs stood in attendance on Him. Each of 
them h ad s ix wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his legs, and with 
two he would fly. And one would call to the other, "Holy, holy, holy! The Lord of Hosts! 
His presence fills all the earth!" 

The doorposts would shake at the sound of the one who called, and the House kept 
filling with smoke. I cried, "Woe is me; I am lost! For I am a man of unclean lips and I live 
among a people of unclean lips; yet my own eyes have beheld the King Lord of Hosts." 

Then one of the seraphs flew over to me with a live coal, which he had taken from the 
altar with a pair of tongs. He touched it to my lips and declared, "Now that this has 
touched your lips, your guilt shall depart and your sin be purged away." 

Then I heard the voice of my Lord saying, "Whom shall I send? Who will go for us?" 
And I said, "Here am I; send me." 

This biblical vision of Isaiah is extremely important in forming elementary con- 
cepts about th e nature of God, of he aven, and of the role of the angels. Here God is 
envisioned as a king whose dwelling" place is not a palace, but a temple. Which temple 
is this? The presence of the angels,jvvhose fun ction is toglorify God, strongly suggests 
it is the heavenly temple. Just this one passage, then, establishes the existence of heaven 
as a place on high inhabited by God and the angels, with His home in the heavenly 
Temple. This vision of Isaiah thus serves as a blueprint for subsequent myths about 
God and heaven. Details about the geography of heaven, about the names and roles of 
the angels, and, above all, about God's role on high, are embellished in rabbinic texts 
and in the Pseudepigrapha, the noncanonical books of the Bible, especially in the books 
of Enoch. Later the heavenly geography is further developed in the kabbalistic and 
Hasidic literature. For an example of a rabbinic elaboration, see "God's Throne of 
Glory," p. 4. 

Isaiah's own role in this vision — in which a seraph touches his mouth with a glow- 
ing stone that takes away guilt from his "unclean lips" — also establishes a pattern of 
interaction between humans and the divine realm, as well as the motif of a healing 
stone. This motif is also found in the Talmud in the myth of a glowing stone that the 
patriarch Abraham was said to have worn around his neck. Anyone who peered into 
the stone was healed ( B . Bava Batra 16b). See "The Tzohar," p. 85. 

A close variant of Isaiah's vision, in which God is also portrayed as seated upon a 
heavenly throne, is found in Daniel 7:9-10. See "Daniel's Night Vision," following.

Isaiah 6:1-8 


2. DANIEL'S NIGHT VISION 

As I looked on, thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took His seat. His 
garment was like white snow, and the hair of His head was like lamb's wool. His throne 
was tongues of flame; its wheels were blazing fire. A river of fire streamed forth before 
Him; thousands upon thousands served Him; myriads upon myriads attended Him; the 
court sat and the books were opened. 

As I looked on, in the night vision, one like a human being came with the clouds of 
heaven; he reached the Ancient of Days and was presented to Him. Dominion, glory, and 
kingship were given to him; all peoples and nations of every language must serve him. 
His dominion is an everlasting dominion that shall not pass away, and his kingship, one 
that shall not be destroyed.

4 MYTHS OF COD 


One way of reading this crucial dream vision of Daniel is to see it as the enthrone- 
ment of two divine manifestations. In one God is identified as the Ancient of Days 
(Atik Yomaya); in the other, as a human being. In this interpretation God can be maiu- 
fested as a young man or as an old man. Some rabbinic texts, such as Mekhilta de-Rabbi 
Ishmael, ba-Hodesh 5:20-30, discuss how God can sometimes appear as an old man and 
sometimes as a young man. See "God's Disguises," p. 16. 

This myth also can be read in a completely different way, where the human figure 
is enthroned as a second divinity, as is found in Jewish Gnosticism. Read this way, this 
myth serves as the template for a series of enthronement myths. See "The Enthrone- 
ment of Adam," p. 131, "The Metamorphosis and Enthronement of Enoch," p. 156, 
"Jacob the Divine," p. 366, "The Enthronement of Moses," and "King David is Crowned 
in Heaven," p. 395. 

Here the Ancie nt of Days — one of the names of God — is seated upon His throne, 
while the youngeTfigure is given ^everlastingdominion/' which appears to be an en- 
thronement. This pattern of the enthronement of a second divine figure in Judaism, 
while surprising because of the expectations of monotheism, is repeated many times in 
subsequent Jewish literature, where enthronement accounts are found for Adam, Jacob, 
Moses, and David, as well as for Enoch, who is transformed into the angel Metatron. 
These texts establish a pattern of Jewish Gnosticism in which a demiurgic figure is in- 
vested with divine powers.

3. GOD'S THRONE OF GLORY 

God sits in the center of a high and exalted throne, exceedingly majestic, suspended in the 
highest heaven, Aravot. Some say that one-half of the throne is made of fire, and the other half 
of snow. Others say that the entire throne consists of fire. A resplendent crown of glory rests 
upon God's head, and upon His forehead are written the four letters of His Name, YHVH. 

God's eyes overlook all of the earth; on His right is life, on His left, death. In His hand 
is a sce pter of fire . Fire surrounds the Throne of Glory, and beneath it sapphires glow. The 
throne stands upon four legs, with four holy creatures attached to it. On each side are 
four faces and four wings. Clouds of glory surround the throne, filled With six-winged 
seraphim singing praises to the Lord. 

God's Throne of Glory is fused with a chariot of fire. It has never set foot on the floor of the 
seventh heaven, but hovers like a bird there. Each day the Throne of Glory sings a hymn 
before God, and thrice daily the throne prostrates itself before God, saying, "God of Israel, sit 
upon me in glory, for Your burden is most dear to me and does not weigh me down." 

Rivers issue forth from under the Throne of Glory: rivers of joy, rivers of rejoicing, 
rivers of jubilation, rivers of love, rivers of friendship. They strengthen themselves and 
pass through the gates of the seventh heaven. 

While God sits upon His throne, high and exalted, and looks down upon the earth, the 
wheels of the chariot roll through the heavens, causing lightning and thunder, as well as 
earthquakes. The chariot is led through the heavens by a swift cherub, who flies upon 
wings of the wind. 


COD'S THRONE OF 6LORY 5 


This is one of many rabbinic myths that elaborates on Isaiah's vision of God seated 
on a heavenly throne (Isa. 6:1-8). Here the description of the throne adds four holy 
creatures (hayyot) attached to it. The throne itself is said to be moving through the 
heavens as if it were some kind of fiery chariot. This image is one of the central para- 
doxes of Jewish mysticism — that God's throne is also such a Merkavah, a fiery chariot, 
both fixed in place in the highest heaven and also traveling through heaven like a 
comet at the same time. This comes directly from the vision of Ezekiel (Ezek. 1:1-28 ). 

God is described in elemental terms, seated on a throne half fire, halFsnowTAc- 
cording to one version, the snow beneath the Throne of Glory was used by God to 
create the Foundation Stone; according to another version, it was used to create the 
whole earth. See the note to "The Work of Creation" p. 90. 

In Masekhet Hekhalot, one of the Hekhalot texts describing heavenly journeys, the 
size of the throne is given in physical terms: "Its length is 800,000 myriads of parasangs, 
and its width is 500,000 myriads of parasangs, and its height is 300,000 parasangs, and 
it reaches from one end of the world to the other." 

In the hymns of Hekhalot Rabbati, one of the most important of the Hekhalot texts, 
God's Throne of Glory is personified, singing a creation hymn before God and pros- 
trating itself before God three times a day.

4. THE DESCENT OF GOD'S THRONE 

In the future God will let his throne descend to the middle of the firmament, and will 
reveal His glory to all who walk on earth. 

Then God will set the place of the righteous closer to his throne than the place of the 
ministering angels. 

There are many scenarios for what will take place in the messianic era. Here God's 
throne is envisioned descending to the middle of the firmament. From there, it would 
be visible to everyone on earth, so that they would be able to see God's glory. The 
myth also stresses the ultimate importance of the righteous to God, who will be closer 
to His throne than will the angels. Other themes of heavenly descent are also to be 
found in "The Descent of the Heavenly Jerusalem," p. 418, and "The Descent of the 
Heavenly Temple," p. 512.

5. THE CROWN OF GOD 

God wears a crown on His head. All the letters of the Hebrew alphabet adorn that crown. 
That crown has two staves, and between them is a precious stone, with the words "Israel, 
My people; Israel My people is mine" engraved on it. For the name of that crown is Israel. 
So too are inscribed the words, My beloved is clear skinned and ruddy , preeminent among ten 
thousand. His head is finest gold , his locks are curled and black as a raven. His eyes are like doves 
by watercourses bathed in milk , set by a brimming pool (S. of S. 5:10-12). 



6 MYTHS OF COD 


Rabbi Akiba defended the inclusion of the Song of Songs in the Bible, saying "The 
whole world existed for the day on which The Song of Songs was given to it. For all 
the Writings are holy, but this is the holy of holies" ( Song of Songs Rabbah 1:11). That 
words from the Song of Songs are engraved on God's crown confirms Rabbi Akiba's 
assertion about the exceptional holiness of that book. 

The letters of the Hebrew alphabet are engraved in the crown, and this serves to 
explain the primal power of the letters, which, tradition holds, were used in the cre- 
ation of the world. See "The Letters of the Alphabet," p. 250. 

The size of God's crown is given in the Sefer ha-Komah as 500,000 by 500,000 
parasangs. By contrast, the circumference of God's head is given in the same text as 
3,003,033 parasangs. 

A similar crown is described as being worn by Metatron, the supreme angel, in 3 
Enoch 13.

6. GOD'S CROWN OF PRAYERS 

Three times each day the prayers of Israel ascend on high. When all of Israel has finished 
praying, what happens to their prayers? They thread their way to Paradise, to the high- 
est heaven, where they are gathered by the angel Sandalphon, the angel appointed over 
prayers. Sandalphon collects all the prayers that have been offered in all the synagogues, 
and weaves them into garlands of prayer that he places upon the head of God, to wear on 
His Throne of Glory. That is why it is said that God is crowned with the prayers of Israel. 

The idea that God wears a crown is a natural development from the concept of God 
as king. Since kings were the highest, most powerful human figures, God was viewed 
as the ultimate king. So too does God have a throne, the Throne of Glory, and a crown. 

The notion of God wearing a crown is also reinforced by the biblical verse: and a splen- 
did crown upon Your head (Ezek. 16:12). 

Here, though, the crown is formed in a wonderful way. The angel Sandalphon, 
charged with gathering the prayers of Israel, first collects the prayers and then weaves 
them into crowns of prayer. In some versions the angel puts the crown directly on 
God. In others, the angel pronounces an adjuration that causes the crown to rise on its 
own and settle on God's head.

7. THE THIRTY-TWO PATHS OF WISDOM 

There are thirty-two paths of wisdom, consisting of the ten sefirot and the twenty-two 
letters of the Hebrew alphabet. By numbers, letters, and sounds, God engraved His Name 
on those paths. 



SEFIROTIC MYTHS 7 


The Sefer Yetzirah, The Book of Creation (or Formation), views the twenty-two letters 
of the Hebrew alphabet and the ten sefirot as the essential building blocks of the uni- 
verse. Together they constitute the thirty-two paths of wisdom.

8. THE TEN SEFIROT 

Ten is the number of the ineffable sefirot, ten and not nine, ten and not eleven. Each of the 
sefirot has the appearance of a flash of lightning. Their origin is beyond human sight, 
their unfolding to the end of time. 

Each sefirah has its own name, and this name can invoke angels and draw down the 
word of God. As they rush forth and return, they bear the divine word with them as a 
messenger carries a message. 

Each sefirah reaches up to the Source of being and down to the created world. Each 
has vast regions bound to it, boundless and neverending, an abyss of good and evil. 
From His throne, God eternally rules over them. The y are great mysteries of Gn H as it is 
said. The secret things belong to Yahzveh (Deut. 29:28), and in them God conceals Himself 
from human beings. Through them God rules secret worlds that have not heen revealed, 
as well as worlds that have been revealed. He binds the sefirot together and unites them. 
He has prepared garments for them, fromjvh^ fly into human beings. 

The sefirot are the channels through which God rules and interacts with all universes — 
those accessible to the human eye and those beyond human understanding, even be- 
yond prophecy. God js hidden wi thin the sefiro t. From them comes all existence — through 
them, from the TugKest sphere, mamTests theTiuman being. 

GodJsJh e m ystery of mysteries. No thought can grasp God at all. In God there is no 
likeness or image of anything within or without. But since God is in the sefirot, whoever 
separates any one of these ten from the others, it is as if he had made a division in God. 

TheJen _sefirot emanated from the ultima te, unknowable God, known as Ein Sof 
(the InfiniteDne), at the moment ot Creation. They pour down energy, level after 
level, at last manifesting into a state of being, a container that receives the divine life 
flowing into it from the other sefirot. The function of the sefirot is a holographic real- 
ity, repeated endlessly, macro and microcosmlcally. ButgenericalljnEat container is 
the tenth sefirah, Malkhut, which is also known as Shekhina h and Knesset Yisrael, the 
soul root Israel (which manifests in the form of the Jewish people). 

All ten sefirot function as a unit to channel the divine energy. They are the conduits 
for ultimate good; yet paradoxically intimated within the very nature of the sefirot is 
the first hint of constriction that ultimately manifests as evil. Therefore, any at tempt 
tpjn^nipulate these forces is co nsidered tampering with di vinity i tself, and obstruct- 
ing the flow of divinity througFTall the worlds. In more classical terminology, who- 
ever separates any one of these ten from the others is considered as though he had 
made a division within the Divine. 

The sefirot, representing the transition from s uper-being to being, a r e, in de scend- 
i n g order: (1) Keter, Crown, the power that comes from the Transcendent (2) Hokhmah , 
Wisdom emerging from the ineffable, (3) Binah, the Understanding that develops, (4) 

Hesed, the generous Lovingkindness that flows downward, (5) Gevurah, the necessary 
Power that holds back and channels that Lovingkindness, (6) Tiferet, the Harmonious 
Beauty that blends Lovingkindness and Might, (7) Netzah, Vanquishment, the giving

of Lovingkindness in a dominant fashion, (8) Hod , Glory, the holding back of Might in 
a more passive fashion, (9) Yesod, the Foundation into which all these energies pour, 
where they are all blended into a more accessible form, and (10) Malkhut , Regency, the 
actualized guidance and rule of the Infinite One. Malkhut also represents the Shekhinah, 
the feminine aspect of God. 

The term "sefirah" seems to have been first used in the ancient kabbalistic text, the 
Sefer Yetzirah , the Book of Formation. Later kabbalistic teachings go into great detail 
describing the interactions of the ten sefirot, and the sefirot are one of the primary 
topics of kabbalah, particularly in the Zohar (which usually alludes to them in a veiled, 
symbolic fashion). The Second Introduction to Tikkunei ha-Zohar contains a brief mys- 
tical essay attributed to the prophet Elijah that describes the nature of each sefirah. 
This selection is still recited by devout Jews at the beginning of the daily prayers.

9. THE TWENTY-TWO LETTERS 

The twenty-two letters of the alphabet are the foundation of everything. God forms, 
weighs, and composes every soul with these letters, and the soul of everything that will 
ever exist. 

God caused the letter aleph to reign in the air and crowned it, and combined it with the 
other letters, and sealed it. And he caused the letter mem to reign in water, crowned it, 
and combined it with the other letters and formed the earth with it. And He caused the 
letter shin to reign in fire, and crowned it, and combined it with the others, and sealed the 
heavens with it. Thus God created something out of nothing, and brought all of existence 
into being. 

This account of the primordial letters is one of the primary kabbalistic creation 
myths, found in Sefer Yetzirah, one of the earliest kabbalistic texts. It describes how 
God created the world through the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The 
CTidleSS" combinations of the alphabet bring every kind of existence into being, what 
the Sefer Yetzirah calls "the soul of everything." 

Just as aleph is crowned in this kabbalistic myth, so alpha, the first letter of the 
Greek alphabet, leads the other letters because alphe means honor. See The Greek Myths 
by Robert Graves, 52c.

SEFIROTK MYTHS 9 


10. THE INFINITE BEING 

The Infinite Being is boundless and without beginning. Except for this Infinite Being, 
everything else that exists has a beginning. At first there arose in Him the potential to 
emanate from His own essence all the worlds that existed potentially within Him. When 
the will of the Infinite Being decided to create. He brought existence from potential to 
actuality. First the Infinite Being emanated its sefirot, through which its actions are per- 
formed. In this way all worlds were brought into being; indeed, all that exists came into 
being from Him, from the depths of the earth to the loftiest heavens. 

This Infinite Being, known as Ein Sof fills all the worlds of time and space. Both the 
heavens above and the earth below are equally filled with His light. There is no place 
empty of Him in the upper or the lower worlds. 

Ein Sof, literally meaning "endless," is the Godhead, the oldest aspect of God, from 
which all of the ten sefirot, the ten numerals or emanations of God, proceed. This part 
of God is considered to be unknowable and above time; indeed, no speculation about 
Ein Sof is permitted. Here Rabbi Levi Yitzhak of Berditchev (1740-1810) makes the 
important point that in the universe it is God alone who does not have a beginning. 

See "The Ten Sefirot," p. 7.

11. THE SEVEN FORMS OF GOD 

God has seven holy forms, and they all have their counterparts in man: God created man in 
His image, in the image of God He created him, male and female He created them (Gen. 1:27). 
And they are the following: the right and left leg, the right and left hands, the trunk with 
the place of procreation, and the head. These are six of the forms, and the seventh is 
God's Bride, about whom it is written, so that they become one flesh (Gen. 2:24). 

This is an example of a sefirotic myth, in which God's body is said to correspond to 
that of man's. The ten sefirot, in descending order, are: 1. Keter (Crown); 2. Hokhmah 
(Wisdom); 3. Binah (Understanding); 4. Hesed (Lovingkindness); 5. Gevurah (Power); 6. 

Tiferet (Beauty); 7. Netzah (Victory); 8. Hod (Splendor); 9. Yesod (Foundation); 10. Malkhut 
(Sovereignty). The seven forms referred to are the seven lower sefirot. The last of these 
is Malkhut, which represents the Shekhinah, the feminine aspect of God . Just as God is 
male and female and isnot complete without his feminine aspect, so man is incom- 
plete without a woman. This diagram can be found on p. 529. See "The Ten Sefirot," p. 

7, and "Adam Kadmon," p. 15.

12. THE TEN CROWNS OF GOD 

God created ten crowns that He wears on His Throne of Glory, and they are He, and He 
is they, like a flame that rises from a burning coal, for there is no division between them. 
With these holy diadems He crowns and clothes Himself. 



10 MYTHS OF COD 


In this sefirotic myth, the ten crowns represent the ten sefirot, ten divine emana- 
tions that brought this world into being. Here God is described as wearing these ema- 
nations as ten crowns, meaning that God holds the creative process of the sefirot in 
the greatest esteem, and they are, in fact, the crown of his creation. 

For another example of a sefirotic myth, see "The Order of Creation," p. 81.

Zohar 3:70a. 

13. THE FIRST BEING 

There is one God who created everything and who guides the celestial spheres. This one 
God is absolutely eternal, and sufficient to HimselfTNothing existed before Him. All 
existing things — whether angels or other celestial beings — exist only through this First 
Being. That God does not have a physical body is kno wn from the verse He is God in 
Heaven above , and upon theearth beneath (Deut. 4:39), for a physical body cannot be in two 
places at the same time. 

One cannot conceive of God as one does of an idolatrous image, for God has no body at all. 
It is not right to serve any but this God of the universe. It is only proper to bow down, 
offer up sacrifices, and make libations to this God, for there is no other God besides Him. 
Whoever permits the thought to enter his mind that there is another deity besides God 
violates the prohibition. You shall have no other gods before Me (Exod. 20:3; Deut. 5:7). 

It is inconceivable that God does not exist. If God did not exist, all of creation would be 
extinguished. 

Maimonides / view of God is rock-solid monotheism: there is only one God, who is 
f also the Creator of everything that exists, including the angels and other heavenly 

, rt t beings. However, Maimonides denies the corporeality of God, which is assumed in 

many myths. Maimonides's statement that "God has no body at all" is quite defini- 
; tive. Indeed, one way of reading this is not as a myth, but as an antimyth, intended to 
limit further mythic development. Maimonides specifically does not want to describe 
God in mythic terms, but as a Deity whose laws have to be interpreted and obeyed.

14. THE CAUSE OF ALL CAUSES 

The Cause of all Causes is above everything. There is no god above Him or below Him. 
He fills all the worlds and He surrounds them from every side. 

Here the "Cause of all Causes" is another name for the Beginning. At the same time, 
the "Cause of all Causes" is also a name of God. This is the unknowable part of God, also 
known in the kabbalah as Pin Sof the Endless One. The "Cause of all Causes" is the name 
given to the force in which the will arose to create the world. In the Zohar 's reading of 
Genesis 1:1, God allows himself to be known through the sefirot, emanations of the 
Godhead in the world. Here God is identified as the source of differentiated being.

GOD'S EXISTENCE 11 


15. GOD'S OMNIPRESENCE 

God is in every place, as it is said. His presence fills all the earth (Isa. 6:3). He fills the 
heavenly and the earthly spheres. When the glory of the Lord filled the Tent of Meeting, 
Moses could not enter there. 

God's omnipresence is acknowledged in numerous biblical verses, such as "For I 
fill both heaven and earth" (Jer. 23:24). The most vivid account of God's presence taking 
a physical form is that in Exod. 40:34-35, where Moses is unable to enter the Tent of 
Meeting because the Cloud of Glory rests upon it, and God's presence fills the tent: 

The cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the Presence ofYahweh filled the Tabernacle . See 
"The Tent of Meeting," p. 42.

16. GOD ALONE 

God is alone, a single being. Neither before the Creation nor after was there anything but 
God, for there is nothing like God. Each of us, on the other hand, consists of body and 
soul, that is why it is not good for man to be alone (Gen. 2:18). But God is not a compound 
being; but a singular one, with a single nature, existing by Himself. 

Here Philo of Alexandria, the first century philosopher, defines the Jewish singular 
nature of God, contrasting Him with humans, who have a dual nature, consisting of 
body and soul. See "God's Existence," following, for an elaboration of this distinction 
between God's oneness and human duality. 

Sources : 

Philo, Legum Allegoriarum 2:1-2. 


17. GOD'S EXISTENCE 

God exists, has always existed, and will always exist. This is the meaning of "I shall be 
what I shall be " (Exod. 3:14). 

Whatever God created. He created as a pair. The heaven and earth are a pair. The sun 
and moon are a pair. This world and the World to Come are a pair. God, however, is alone 
in the world, as it is said. Hear , O Israel! The Lord is our God , the Lord is one (Deut. 6:4). It 
was He in Egypt, at the Sea, He in the desert. He in this world. He in the World to Come. 

Likewise, God created the heavenly beings with His right hand and the earthly beings 
with His left. 

There are times when the entire world and all that is in it cannot contain God's glory, 
while at other times God speaks to man from inside the Ark of the Tabernacle. 

God's existence is reaffirmed in this midrash, along with God's role as Creator. The 

duality of existence is in contrast to the singular nature of God, as stated in the Shema, 

The Lord is our God , the Lord is one (Deut. 6:4).

18. GOD'S GAZE 

If God's gaze were withdrawn for even a moment, all of existence would cease. 

According to this sixteenth century kabbalistic text, God's gaze is the paramount 
requirement for the continued existence of the world. The notion of God's gaze im- 
plies that the existence of this world also depends on God's continued interest in His 
world and all its creatures.

19. GOD'S DAY 

Some say that from morning till evening God ponders upon the Throne of Glory, consid- 
ering new thoughts and plans. He ponders how to create the deep, how to create the 
heights, how to create the pillars of the clouds, how to create the foundation of the world. 

And from evening until morning God descends from the Throne of Glory and rides 
upon sparks of fire and arranges the orders of the new worlds with his fingers. He posi- 
tions the upper worlds opposite the lower ones, and the lower worlds opposite the upper. 

Others say that for the first three hours of the day God is engaged in the study of 
Torah. During the next three hours God sits in judgment of the world. During the next 
three hours He feeds the whole world, from homed buffalo to vermin. During the next 
three hours some say He plays with Leviathan, while others insist that He sits and teaches 
school children. Still others say that He blesses bridegrooms, adorns brides, visits the 
sick, buries the dead, and recites the blessing for mourners. 

And what does God do at night? He rides a cherub of light and floats in 18,000 worlds, 
listening to heavenly songs. 

Here are two accounts about how God spends His day. The first, from Midrash 
Aleph Bet, shows that God has two primary modes, one of contemplation, which takes 
place during the day, and one of action, which takes place at night. Note that this is 
the reverse of human behavior, which uses the day for action and the night for con- * 
templation. This myth echoes many biblical passages about God's work of Creation, 
such as Psalms 33:6: By the word ofYahweh the heavens were made, and all their host by the 
breath of His mouth. 

The second account of God's day, from the Talmud, divides the first 12 hours of the 
day into four three-hour units. During these 12 hours, God puts in a very active day, 
devoting Himself to study, judgment, sustenance of the world, and, for relaxation, 
either playing with Leviathan or teaching children. But here God's second 12 hours 
are spent in floating on a cherub through thousands of worlds or in listening to the 
song of the living creatures, both quite passive roles. Since the whole myth creates 
parallels between God's day and that of a person, this passive role resembles some- 
thing like God's dreamtime. 

In both mythic accounts, God moves from active to passive roles, and He is re- 
quired to divide His time much as do His children, who must find time to sustain 
themselves and their families while also properly devoting themselves to the study of 
Torah. Thus both views of God's day are quite reassuring, for they demonstrate the 
kabbalistic principle of "as above, so below," in which the upper worlds and lower 
worlds are mirrors of each other, and even God has a schedule that He must follow.

COD'S MYSTERY 13 


20. THE HIDDEN GOD 

No one knows where God is hidden. Not even the ministering angels who tend God's 
Throne of Glory know where God can be found, nor do the heavenly creatures who carry 
the Throne, for God has encircled Himself with darkness and cloud all around, as it is 
said. He made darkness His screen (Ps. 18:12). Indeed, some say that the true meaning of the 
verse You hid Your face (Ps. 30:8) is that God is hidden from Himself. 

This myth of a hidden God is based on the verse He that dwells in the secret place, the 
most high, in the shade of God He will linger (Ps. 91:1). Other verses that confirm this 
view of a hidden God are Psalm 30:8: You hid Your face, and Isaiah 64:6: For You have 
hidden Your face from us . 

This might be regarded as a dark myth about the absence of God, or it might be 
seen as a metaphor for the hidden nature of God: just as no person knows where his 
soul is located within himself, so too does no one know the place of God. 

The most profound development of a hidden God is found in kabbalah, where 
God's hiddenness is directly related to God as Ein Sof, which literally meaning "end- 
less." This is the infinite God, the unknowable God, the God above the realm of the 
sefirot. The Zohar states, for example, that " Ein Sof does not abide being known" (Zohar 
3:26b). 

Masekhet Hekhalot 3 offers a strange reason for God having hidden Himself: "So 
that the ministering angels cannot be nourished by the splendor of the Shekhinah, nor 
by the splendor of His throne, nor by the splendor of His glory, nor by the splendor of 
His kingship." In this view God is inaccessible to the angels and is determined to 
withhold his glory from them. This conclusion follows the kabbalistic concept of Ein 
Sof, where the ultimate nature of God must always remain unknown. 

In Likutei Moharan Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav (1772-1811) interprets You hid Your 
face (Ps. 30:8) as meaning that God has turned his back on the Jewish people during 
the Exile: "In our Exile the face of God is hidden. All our prayers and requests are a 
result of God's having turned His back to us. We want Him to turn back His face, as it 
is said. Turn to me" (Ps. 86:16).

21. THE CONTRACTION OF GOD 

Before God created the world, God's light filled all of existence. There was no vacant 
place, no empty space or void. Everything was filled with the light of the Infinite. Nor 
did that light have any beginning or end, and that is why it is called the infinite light. 

When God decided to create worlds. He contracted Himself, and left an empty space 
in which to emanate and bring the worlds into being. He contracted His essence into no 
more than a handbreadth, and at that instant darkness spread everywhere, for God's 
infinite light had been withdrawn. 

How did God create this world? Like a person who draws in his breath, so that the 
smaller might contain the larger, so did God contract His light into a handsbreadth, and 
the world was left in darkness. And in that darkness God carved large boulders and 
hewed rocks to clear wondrous paths of wisdom. 



14 MYTHS OF COD 


The primary source for this myth of God's contraction comes from Rabbi Hayim 
Vital's (1542-1640) Etz Hayim (The Tree of Life). Vital was the primary disciple of Rabbi 
Isaac Luria, known as the Ari (1534-1572). The purpose of this myth is to explain how, 
since God's presence (or infinite light) pervaded the universe, there could be room for 
Creation. The answer is this contraction of God, known as tzimtzum. Tzimtzum is the 
preliminary stage of the famous creation myth of the Ari. See "The Shattering of the 
Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks," p. 122. 

The infinite light (or Ein Sof) is said to have pervaded all of existence until God 
contracted Himself. Hayim Vital gives the precise location of the contraction, saying 
that the light, which formed a circle, contracted itself at its midpoint, in the exact 
center of the light, withdrawing to the circumference, leaving an empty space in be- 
tween. The World of Emanation and all other worlds exist inside that circle, with the 
light of the infinite surrounding it. 

Vital's explanation is as follows: 

Know that before the emanations were manifested and the creatures were formed, 
there was a simple ethereal light that filled all of existence. There was no empty space at 
all, such as an empty atmosphere or a vacuum, for everything was filled with that infinite 
light. This light had nothing in the sense of a beginning or an end, for everything was one 
simple light equally distributed. This is called the infinite light. 

And when in His simple will the desire arose to create the worlds and manifest the 
emanations, to bring to light the perfection of his deeds, names, and attributes— which 
was the reason for the creation of the worlds— behold God then contracted Himself in the 
middle point of Himself, in the very center of His light. And He contracted that light, and 
it was withdrawn to the sides around the middle point. Then there remained an empty 
space, an atmosphere, and a vacuum surrounding the very middle point. 

And behold, this contraction ( tzimtzum ) was equally distributed around that empty 
middle point in such a way that the vacuum was circular on all its sides equally. 

The notion that God's presence fills the world is found in the biblical account of the 
Tent of Meeting, which Moses was unable to enter because God's presence had filled 
it entirely: The cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the Presence of the Lord filled the 
Tabernacle. Moses could not enter the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud had settled upon it 
and the Presence of the Lord filled the Tabernacle (Exod. 40:34-35). Likewise, this idea is 
found in the verse " For I fill both heaven and earth " says Yahweh (Jer. 23:24). About this 
King David is quoted as saying, "Just as the soul fills the body, so God fills the whole 
world" (Lev. Rab. 4:8). 

At the same time, the notion that God can contract His presence and concentrate it 
in a single place is based on the tradition that God was able to speak to Moses from 
between the two staves of the Ark of the Tabernacle (Genesis Rabbah 4:4). Even more 
explicit is Exodus Rabbah 34:1, where God says, "I will descend and concentrate My 
presence within one square cubit of the Ark." Thus, when God wishes He can fill 
heaven and earth, as it is said. Do I not fill heaven and earth? (Jer. 23:24), and when He so 
desires. He can speak to Moses from between the staves of the Ark. 

For Dov Ber, the Maggid of Mezritch, tzimtzum took place in this world, as God 
contracted His infinite light, but in the higher world God's light is unrestricted. He 
found confirmation of this in Isaiah 60:19, No longer shall you need the sun for light by 
day. . . For the Lord shall be your light everlasting, your God shall be your glory (Maggid 
Devarav le-Ya'akov 184).

COD'S MYSTERY 15 


22. ADAM KADMON 

Adam Kadmon, the supernal man, was the beginning of all beginnings, the most ancient 
of all primordial beings. Adam Kadmon preceded all other creations, and from Adam 
Kadmon all other worlds spread forth. He was the first creation to fill the void created by 
God's contraction, consisting of ten emanations in the form of circular wheels, one inside 
the other, which came forth, followed by the form of a single human being. And that was 
Adam Kadmon, the primordial man, a completely spiritual being. When it is said that 
man was created in the image of God, this refers to the form of Adam Kadmon. For God 
Himself has no form or image. 

Filled with the light of the infinite, Adam Kadmon extends from one end of the empty 
space God created to the other. Some say that this infinite light emerges from the open- 
ings and apertures of the skull of Adam Kadmon, from his ears, his nose, his mouth and 
his eyes. Others say that the light issues from his mouth, his navel, and his phallus. The 
lights that issue from his mouth reach into all comers of the world, although only the 
points of the lights, called the branches, go forth, while the roots remain within him. 
From the forehead of Adam Kadmon tremendous lights shine forth in rich and complex 
patterns, some taking the form of letters and words of the Torah. These lights come forth 
from where the box of tefillin is placed. 

All the lights that shine forth from Adam Kadmon eventually come together into a 
single circle. This light is so great that it can only be received if transmitted through the 
filter of his being. Still, the light that remains inside Adam Kadmon is far greater than the 
light that emerges from him. 

Adam Kadmon contains thousands of myriads of worlds. The first four of these to 
come forth from Adam Kadmon are the Four Worlds, the worlds of Emanation ( Atzilut ), 
Creation ( Beriah ), Formation ( Yetzirah ), and Action ( Asiyah ). The creation of Adam Kadmon 
and of these other, lower worlds had a beginning in time, when they came into being. But 
this is not true of the Infinite One, who has no beginning or end. 

The complex concept of Adam Kadmon serves both as a mythic figure and as an 
abstract kabbalistic function. The term ''Adam Kadmon" means "primordial man," 
and Adam Kadmon is understood to be the spiritual prototype of man, a kind of cos- 
mic soul. At the same time, the figure of Adam Kadmon can also be recognized as an 
anthropomorphic manifestation of God, a male deity assuming the shape and fea- 
tures of a human being. The concept likely evolved from the older idea — prominent 
in Philo's writings — of a heavenly man who was created at the same time, or prior to, 
the earthly Adam. See "The Heavenly Man," p. 124. Like Philo's concept of the heav- 
enly man, the existence and nature of Adam Kadmon are based on the verse And God 
created man in His image (Gen. 1:27). In Philo's view, the heavenly man is the pure 
image of God, and in the kabbalistic view, especially as found in Lurianic kabbalah, 
Adam Kadmon is said to contain every image of man that would ever exist — thus he 
is an archetype or prototype of man. According to Yosef ibn Tabul in Kerem Hayah le- 
Shlomo, Adam Kadmon, like the earthly Adam, transgressed in some fashion. 

At the same time, there are major differences between the heavenly man and Adam 
Kadmon. While the heavenly man seems like a purely mythic concept, Adam Kadmon, 
despite its anthropomorphic qualities, is understood to serve "as a kind of interface 
between the Infinite Creator and the finite creation" (Aryeh Kaplan, Inner Space , p. 

23). It appears that Kaplan would entirely deny the apparent mythic nature of Adam 
Kadmon: "One of the main tasks of the Kabbalah tradition was to allow us to interpret 
these anthropomorphisms. It is universally agreed that they are to be understood alle- 
gorically rather than literally" ( Inner Space , pp. 111-112). 



16 MYTHS OF tiOD 


The myth of Adam Kadmon is directly related to that of God's contraction. See the 
prior myth, "The Contraction of God." By contracting Himself, God created space in 
the universe for the universe to be created. Adam Kadmon is God's first creation, 
which fills the empty space. 

While Adam Kadmon is said to take the shape of a human, it may well be that this 
is intended in much the same way various constellations of stars are identified in 
astrology. Thus Adam Kadmon could be understood as a constellation in the shape of 
a man, just as the Pleiades are identified as seven sisters and Orion as a man who is 
pursuing them. For Adam Kadmon is clearly intended to represent a cosmic realm. 
Indeed, Adam Kadmon represents the "inconceivable universe," as Jorge Luis Borges 
describes it in "The Aleph" ( Collected Fictions , pp. 284). 

At the same time Adam Kadmon is a cosmic metaphor, representing a stage in the 
creation of the world as well as the universe itself. 

Above all, Adam Kadmon is part of the complex kabbalistic theory of God's ema- 
nation of the world, containing the ten sefirot. 

Likewise, in Etz Hayim, Derush Igulim ve-Yosher 4:28a:l-15, Hayim Vital adds a clear 
disclaimer explaining that the human qualities attributed to Adam Kadmon should 
not be understood literally: "It should be clear that there is no body in the higher 
realm. As for all the images we use, it is not because it is actually so, but only so that 
one can understand higher spiritual matters that cannot be comprehended by the hu- 
man understanding." 

Nevertheless, there remain distinct mythic qualities associated with Adam Kadmon 
that reflect his role as the first primordial being that God created, who is described as 
taking the form of a human being. The meaning of his name — primordial man — and 
its obvious link with the earthly Adam, and the description of his body, where consid- 
erable emphasis is placed on his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears, all combine to suggest 
that Adam Kadmon is a demiurgic figure. At the same time, in terms of kabbalistic 
cosmology, Adam Kadmon functions as a conduit, shaped like a human, through which 
the light of the infinite (Or Ein Sof) passes before being emanated into the Four Worlds. 
These are the World of Emanation (Atzilut), The World of Creation {Beriah) f The World 
of Formation ( Yetzirah ), and the World of Action (Asiyah). These worlds correspond to 
the senses of vision, hearing, smell, and speech. 

The ten emanations that Adam Kadmon contains are the ten sefirot. Thus, from a 
kabbalistic perspective, Adam Kadmon is not only a primordial being, but a cosmic 
forcefield that contains the creative forces of existence. See a diagram of the Tree of 
Life on p. 529. 

The role of God in the myth of Adam Kadmon is very interesting. God appears to 
have multiple roles. On the one hand God is the Infinite One, known as Ein Sof, mean- 
ing "Endless," who creates Adam Kadmon, and the rest of creation emanates from Adam 
Kadmon, who contains the ten sefirot. But since Ein Sof is completely unknowable, Adam 
Kadmon is the first manifestation of divine existence that can be perceived.

23. GOD'S DISGUISES 

God has appeared in many disguises. At the crossing of the Red Sea, God appeared to the 
Israelites as a mighty warrior, fighting their battles. The people were able to point at God 



COD'S MYSTERY 17 


with their fingers, and they beheld His image as a man is able to look at his friend's face. 
At Mount Sinai, where the Torah was given, God appeared as an old man, full of mercy. 
In the days of King Solomon God appeared as a young man, and in the days of Daniel as 
an old man teaching Torah. Therefore God said to them: " I am He who was in Egypt, I am 
He who was at the sea , and I am He who was at Sinai. I am He who was in the past and I am He 
who will be in the future. I am He who is in this world and I am He who will be in the world to 
come. Even though you see me in various guises , 7 Yahweh am your God'" (Exod. 20:2). 

This myth emphasizes God's ability to take whatever form He wishes. He can ap- 
pear as a young man or an old man, as a warrior or a teacher. B. Rosh ha-Shanah de- 
scribes how "God drew his robe around him like the leader of a congregation and 
showed Moses the order of the prayer." Thus God can not only change His size, but 
even His appearance. The important point is that it is the same God, no matter how 
He appears. Here the rabbis have found a way to retain the variety of types of gods 
found in pagan mythologies, while still insisting that every manifestation is that of 
the same God: "Even though you see me in various guises, 7 Yahweh am your God/" 

The reference to God's appearance in the time of Solomon as a young man derives 
from Song of Songs 5:15: He is majestic as Lebanon, stately as the cedars. God's appearance 
as a young warrior at the Red Sea is linked to the verse Yahweh, the Warrior — Yahweh is 
His name (Exod. 15:3). God's appearance as an old man at Mount Sinai is linked to the 
verse With aged men is wisdom, and understanding in length of days (Job 12:12). 

Pesikta Rabbati 21 adds that God appeared to the people at Mount Sinai with many 
faces: a threatening face, a severe face, an angry face, a joyous face, a laughing face, 
and with a friendly face. Further, to some He appeared standing, to others seated, to 
some as a young man, and to others as an old man. If a heathen should say that these 
are different gods, it should be pointed out that the Torah does not say that "The gods 
have spoken face to face," but: Face to face Yahweh spoke to you (Deut. 5:4).

24. WHERE GOD DWELLS 

Some say that God dwells in the celestial realms, in the highest heaven, where He is 
seated on the Throne of Glory. 

Others say that God hovers equidistant between the upper and lower worlds. That is 
the meaning of the verse "The heaven is My throne and the earth is My footstool" (Isa. 66:1). 

All agree that the Shekhinah, the Divine Presence, makes her home in this worlcT 

God is most often identified as dwelling in heaven, as in the vision of Isaiah in 
which God is seated on a high and lofty throne (Isa. 6:1-8). But here God is described 
as hnvpring hptwppn heaven and earth. Further, the Shekhinah, the Divine Presence, is 
said to make her home on earth. The traditional view is that the Shekhinah's home was 
the Temple in Jerusalem. Note that the Shekhinah is sometimes identified as God, some- 
times as the Divine Presence, and sometimes as the Bride of God.

18 MYTHS OF &lt;iOD 


25. THE HOLY SPIRIT 

Before the celestial world was revealed, before there were the Throne of Glory and the 
Par god, the heavenly curtain, before there were angels, seraphs, constellations or stars, 
before all this there was an ethe r, an essence from w hich sprang a primordial light. This 
l ight is calledth e Hnly Sp irit ~ 

The Holy Spirit consis ts of three parts. Spirit, Voice an d Word.. From Spirit God pro- 
duced air, and formedt wenty-two sound s: the letters of the alphabet. From air He formed 
waters, and from chaos and void he made mire and clay, and from them He formed the 
foundation of existence. And from the waters God formed fire, and made a Throne of 
Glory for Himself, where He is surrounded by the ministering angels. That is why it is 
written. Who makes His angels spirits and His ministers a flaming fire (Ps. 104:4). That is how 
air, water, and fire were created — fire above, water be low, and air between them. 

The Holy Spirit embraced all the patriarchs, kings7and prophets. Through the Holy 
Spirit, Adam was able to see the future generations, until the End of Days. Enoch was 
taken into heaven in a chariot, and when he returned to earth for 30 days, the Holy Spirit 
spoke through him, and he revealed the secrets of heaven. The Holy Spirit spoke through 
Noah, and he warned of the coming Flood. “ — 

After God's covenant with Abraham, he was possessed by the Holy Spirit at all times. 
Abraham saw with the Holy Spirit that David would descend from him. As for Isaac, the 
angels on high took Isaac and brought him to the heavenly academy of Shem and Eber, 
where he studied for three years, and when he returned, he saw the world through the 
eyes ofjhe Holy Spirit. That is why his own sight grew dim. Jacob discovered the Holy 
Spirit when Keclreamed ofthe ladder reaching from earth to heaven, with angels ascend- 
ing and descending on it. 

With the aid of the Holy Spirit, Joseph was able to divine the future and interpret 
dreams. So too did the Holy Spirit inhabit King David as if he were a vessel for the Psalms 
that poured forth from him. And in his old age, just before his death, the Holy Spirit 
descended on King Solomon and he composed the books attributed to him: Proverbs, the 
S ong of Songs, and Ecclesi astes. 

~AlTof the Drophets spoke through the Holy Spirit. Ezekiel was fully possessed of the 
Holy Spirit when he saw the Divine Chariot, and Isaiah saw with the eyes of the Holy 
Spirit when he had a vision of God seated on a high and exalted throne. So too was the 
Scroll of Esther written with the Holy Spirit. 

Some say that from the day the Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, the power of 
prophecy was taken from the prophets and given to the sages. After the demise of the last 
prophets, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, the Holy Spirit departed from Israel, as it is 
said. And the lifebreath returns to God (Eccles. 12:7). After that, the people were informed of 
the unknown by means ot a heavenly voice 

And when the heavenly voice could no longer be heard, letters fell from heaven into 
the hands of those intended to receive them. But for a long time no such letters have 
fallen, and heaven has been silent. 

The Holy Spirit is the known as the Ruah ha-Kodesh. The key motif of the myth of 
the Holy Spirit is that it departed from Israel after the last prophets. Here ruah, which 
means both "spirit" and "breath," is understood to refer to the Holy Spirit. 

The heavenly voice is known as a bat kol, the daughter of a voice. There are a num- 
ber of rabbinic reports about hearing such a voice speak from on high. One of the 
most famous refers to the voice that is said to go forth in heaven 40 days before a child 
is bom. This heavenly voice is heard by the angels and by some extraordinary sages, 
such as the Ari. See "God makes Matches," p. 66. 



COD'S MYSTERY 19 


In Sefer Yetzirah, an early cosmological text, the three parts of the Holy Spirit are 
identified with the three upper sefirot, Keter (Crown), Hokhmah (Wisdom), and Binah 
(Understanding), and identifies them, respectively, as spirit, voice, and word. These 
elemental forces were said to have been used by God to create the letters of the alpha- 
bet, as well as air, water, and earth. Thus the Ruah ha-Kode$h serves in this sefirotic 
myth as a tool used by God in Creation. 

The loss of the Ruah ha-Kodesh was regarded as a rejection of the later Jewish gen- 
erations. This is indicated by the verse And the sprit returns to God (Eccles. 12:7). The 
means of direct communication with God by divine inspiration had been lost. All that 
remained was a message delivered by a heavenly voice, a bat kol A legend in the 
Talmud recounts that in the time of Hillel the Elder, the sages were discussing matters 
of the Law in an attic in Jericho when a heavenly voice spoke and said: "There is only 
one among you worthy of receiving divine inspiration, but your generation is not 
worthy of it." Everyone looked at Hillel. When he died, they said, "He was a worthy 
disciple of Ezra" (B. Sanhedrin 11a). 

^Prophetic inspiration is often said to come from the Holy Spirit. In its most powerful 
manifestation, prophetic inspiration made it possible for the greatest of all figures in 
Jewish history, such as Abraham and Moses, to communicate directly with God. But 
over time the potency of divine inspiration waned. Indeed, the primary pattern is one of 
a progressive loss of prophetic inspiration. This is the kind of direct knowledge of God 
demonstrated by Abraham and Moses, which is replaced by the prophecy of the proph - 
ets such as Ezekiel and Isaiah, whose knowledge of the divine come s from apparitions 
and vis ions. This kind of prophecy, in turn, is replaced by the prophecy of the sages. 
Here the sages derive their know ledge from a process of reasoning , yet it must be vali- 
dated by prophetic inspiration, which gives it the seal of truth. By this time prophetic 
inspiration has become a kin d of intuition of thp divin p in which the voice of God must ^ 
be heard inside oneself. WhSi Elijah stands on the mountain and the Lord passes by, 
Elijah does not find God in the wind, in an earthquake, and in a fire. Instead, he finds 
God i n a still , small voice (1 Kings 19:11-12). This seems like a good description of the 
kind oFintuition that has replaced prophecy since rabbinic times. 

The generational change portrayed in this myth of the Holy Spirit parallels that of 
the transition from patriarchs to priests to rabbis. Before the Temple was destroyed, 
its priests dominated Jewish ritual life. But when the Temple was destroyed, the re- 
sponsibility for sustaining the heritage fell to the rabbis, as did prophetic inspiration. 
One famous hasidic tale of Rabbi Israel of Rizhin (1797-1850) describes how each suc- 
ceeding generation knows less of a ritual performed in a forest by the Ba'al Shem Tov 
(1700-1760), until the latest generation knows only the story about it (Knesset Yisrael 
12a). See "Lighting a Fire" in Gabriel's Palace , pp. 209-210. 

Sefer Hasidim (par. 1473) speaks of a kind of prophetic wisdom in which it is pos- 
sible to look at a piece of meat and know whether the slaughterer had intercourse 
with his wife on the previous night. This reflects one vision of the Tzaddik, the excep- 
tionally righteous man, who, like the Ari, can look at a man's forehead and read the 
history of his soul (known as Metoposcopy), or point to a stone in the wall and tell 
whose soul is trapped in it. Rabbi Yitzhak Eizik Safrin of Komamo states that "There 
are letters written on every part of the human body which can be seen and read by a 
Tzaddik. These letters appear mainly on the forehead and reveal a person's character 
(Zohar Hai, Yitro 92-93). All of these are examples of prophetic inspiration, but none 
approach the kind of divine illumination experienced by the patriarchs — Abraham, who 
spoke with God on several occasions; Isaac, whose soul is said to have left his body and 
traveled to heaven during the Akedah (the binding of Isaac in Genesis 22); and Jacob, 
who not only had the dream of the ladder reaching to heaven, but also wrestled with 
a mysterious angel. There are all kinds of remarkable traditions about Moses, particu- 
larly about his heavenly ascent to receive the Torah directly from God. An extensive 
tradition also grew up around Enoch's ascent into Paradise and his transformation

into the angel Metatron. See "The Metamorphosis and Enthronement of Enoch/' p. 
166. The prophets, too, received messages from on high and reported God's words in 
their writings. After that, however, these prophecies came to an end.

26. THE BREATH OF GOD 

At the time of the creation of the world, God's Throne of Glory stood in space, hovering 
over the surface of the waters like a dove over its nest, suspended by means of the breath 
of the mouth of God, as it is said, and a wind from God sweeping over the water (Gen. 1:2). 
Four gatherings of angels sang praises before Him, and the waters rose up and touched 
His throne. And God himself sat at the center on his lofty and exalted throne, elevated 
and suspended in the air, and his gaze encompassed the entire world. 

The Hebrew term for "the spirit of God" is " Ruah Elohim" which also means "the 
breath of God." The image of God sitting on his lofty and exalted throne is borrowed 
from Isaiah 6:1 and is repeated in Daniel 7:9. See "Isaiah's Vision," p. 3.

27. THE MIND OF GOD 

In the beginning God's mind had everything in it, all that existed or would come to exist. 
It contained the darkness and the void, the light and the earth, as well as all yet to be 
called into being. It contained the colors of the rainbow, although no rainbow had yet 
shone. It contained the green color of the leaves and all the shades of the sunset, as well 
as the brightness of light that had not yet been brought into being. 

Here all of existence is said to have existed in God's mind before it was created. 

The concept has a strong echo of the Platonic archetype, but here the archetypes all 
find their origin in God's mind. 

This myth grows out of the belief that God's presence filled all of the universe 
before the Creation, and it follows logically the kind of personification of God so com- 
mon in rabbinic sources. Thus if God has eyes, a voice, hands, and feet, etc., God also 
has a mind and His own thoughts. This also follows the metaphor of God as the di- 
vine architect, who carefully planned out all of Creation long before the first day, 
when God said. Let there be light (Gen. 1:3).

28. THE EYES OF GOD 

From His throne in heaven, God's eyes observe all that takes place in the world. With one 
of His eyes. He sees from one end of the universe to the other. With His other eye. He sees 
behind Him that which has yet to happen. Nothing, not even the future, is hidden from 
God. Even before a person has crystallized a thought in his mind, God already knows it. 
God sees what is in the light and what is in the dark. There are no secret places for people 
to hide where God will not see them. Even those who transgress with utmost secrecy in 
the innermost chambers of their dwellings, in a place of darkness and in an area com- 
pletely hidden — even those will go down to Gehenna, for God sees them. 

God is vigilant both day and night. And on Rosh ha-Shanah all creatures are reviewed 
by the eyes of God at a single glance. 

The principle that God sees all deeds is one of the essential beliefs of Judaism. 
Virtually each of the assertions made here about God is based on a biblical verse in- 
cluding The eyes ofYahweh are everywhere (Prov. 15:3); "If a man enters a hiding place , Do 
I not see him?" (Jer. 23:24); For Yahweh searches all minds and discerns the design of every 
thought (1 Chron. 28:9); and He reveals deep and hidden things , knows what is in the dark- 
ness , and light dwells with Him (Dan. 2:22). 

Another reference to the eyes of God is found in "Abraham's Dying Vision," p. 347. 

For a modern story based on the concept of the eyes of God, see "The Aleph" by Jorge 
Luis Borges in his Collected Fictions , pp. 274-286

29. THE FACE OF GOD 

The face of the God of Israel is a lovely face, a majestic face, a face of beauty, a face of 
flame. When God sits on His Throne of Glory, His majesty surpasses the beauty of the 
bridegroom and bride in their bridal chambers. 

Whoever beholds the face of God will be tom to pieces at once, as it is said , " You cannot 
see My face, for man may not see Me and live " (Exod. 33:20). 

The tradition that a human may not behold God's face derives from Exodus. Moses 
asked God to behold His Presence, but God told him that " You cannot see my face, for 
man may not see Me and live" (Exod. 33:20). 

This myth presents an essential paradox about the nature of God's face. On the one 
hand it is said to be beautiful beyond measure or imagination. On the other hand, 
whoever beholds it will be instantly "torn to pieces." This might suggest that some 
heavenly guard, such as those found at each gate of the heavenly palaces, will attack 
if the one who has ascended glimpses God's face. However, the same passage in 
Hekhalot Rabbati offers another metaphor for the destruction that will take place: who- 
ever glimpses God's beauty will instantly pour himself out as a vessel. 

In Moses, Martin Buber speculates that since "man may not see Me and live," and 
since God is said to have led the people, that "YHVH goes ahead of the people in 
order to overthrow foes who meet them on the way." This may explain the meaning of 
Deuteronomy 4:37, where God is said to have led the people out of Egypt "with His 
face."

30. THE SIZE OF GOD 

We can begin to comprehend the greatness of God from the size of His fist, as it is said. 
Who measured the waters with the hollow of His hand (Isa. 40:12). 

His greatness can also be determined from his size of his finger, as it is said. And meted 
earth's dust with a measure (Isa. 40:12). 

We can also learn about God's greatness from his dwelling place. Although the heav- 
ens extend above the sea, as well as all the inhabited and uninhabited lands, they still do 
not contain God's throne. 

Many esoteric Jewish texts are devoted to describing God's gigantic size and char- 
acteristics. The best known of these texts is Shi’ur Komah. Less comprehensive de- 
scriptions of God s size are found throughout rabbinic literature, as here from Midrash 
Tanhuma-Yelammedenu, which describes the size of God's fist and his finger, as well as 
suggesting the enormity of God's throne. See "The Body of God," p. 24.

31. THE THREE KEYS 

Three keys are in the hand of God that have not been entrusted to anyone — not to an 
angel, nor to a seraph, nor even to a troop of seraphim. Rather, God keeps them in His 
own hand. They are the key of the rains, the key of the womb, and the key of the resurrec- 
tion of the dead. 

The key of the rains opens the Treasury of Rain in the sixth heaven. 

The key of birth is the key to the Guf, where the souls of those who have not yet been 
bom are kept. 

But no one knows where the key to the resurrection of the dead is hidden, not even the 
angels. Nor will God take it out until the time has come for the footsteps of the Messiah 
to be heard. 


This tradition of three keys is attributed to the talmudic sage. Rabbi Yohanan. These 
are understood to be the most important keys — to the rain, representing nature; to birth, 
i.e., life, and to the resurrection of the dead, which is rebirth after death. Each of these is 
a life-giving force. The extensive traditions about God delegating various heavenly re- 
sponsibilities to Metatron, in particular, as well as to other angels, are counteracted here 
with the assertion that God retains the core power of life-giving, and that is the essential 
power of God; nothing else really matters. This kind of struggle over the primacy of 
God's role is an integral part of the ongoing dialectic found in Jewish mythology. 



COD'S ATTRIBUTES 23 


Battei Midrashot lists many other keys that God holds: the key of sustenance, the 
key of femininity, the key to manna, the key of the renewal of the kingdom, the key of 
the eyes, the key of silence, the key of the lips, the key of the tongue, the key of prison- 
ers, the key of the land, the key of the Garden of Eden, and the key of Gehenna. Each 
of these assertions is accompanied by a prooftext that demonstrates that God does 
indeed hold that key, such as. He rained manna upon them for food (Ps. 78:24) to demon- 
strate that God holds the key to the manna. See "The Treasury of Souls," p. 166.

32. THE ARMS OF GOD 

God carries everything beneath His arms. With His right arm he carries the heavens, and 
with His left arm he carries the earth. How much do God's arms carry? The left carries 
the 18,000 worlds that surround this world. The right carries 120,000 worlds of the World 
to Come. 

The length of God's arms is like the length of this world from one end to another; the 
width, like the width of this world. And the radiance of God's arm is like the splendor of 
the sun in the season of Tammuz. 

This myth finds its biblical source in Deuteronomy 33:27: The eternal God is your 
refuge , and underneath are the everlasting arms. This can also be understood as under- 
neath the arms is the world. The mythic notion that the heavens, and all that is in 
them, hang beneath God's right arm, and the earth, and all that is in it, hangs beneath 
His left arm, portrays everything as completely dependent on a God who is larger 
than the universe. Other myths describe the world hung like an amulet from God's 
arm. See "A Universe of Water," p. 94. Still others describe God using His arms to 
destroy prior worlds. See "Prior Worlds," p. 71. Yet others assert that the Torah is 
inscribed on God's arm (Merkavah Rabbah). See "The Torah Written on the Arm of 
God," p. 252.

33. GOD'S HANDS 

The name of God's right hand is Just, and the name of the left is Holy. Sometimes God 
uses one hand to create something, and sometimes he uses both hands. God used only 
one hand to create a holy mountain, for it is written. He brought them to His holy realm, the 
mountain His right hand had acquired (Ps. 78:54). But both Adam and the Temple were 
created with both of God's hands. 

How do we know that God created Adam using both hands? Because it is written Your 
hands have made me and fashioned me (Ps. 119:73). And how do we know that the Temple 
was created with both hands of God? From the verse The sanctuary, O Yahweh, which Your 
hands established (Exod. 15:17). 



24 MYTHS OF &lt;&amp;OD 


That God used His hands to create Adam is strongly suggested by the biblical text: 
the Lord God formed man from the dust of the earth (Gen. 2:7). 

This midrash about God's hands suggests an underlying myth that God can create 
using a single hand or both hands. Biblical verses are brought in to prove that God 
created using both methods. A holy mountain, probably Sinai, was created with one 
hand, while biblical verses about Adam and the Temple describe them as having been 
created out of both hands. These latter two are among God's finest creations, and it is 
implied that they were even better because they were created with both of God's hands. 

It is interesting to contrast the myths about God's words with those about God's 
hands. Because Genesis begins with a creation myth in which God creates through 
His words, creation through speech became the dominant tradition. But there is also 
an extensive rabbinic tradition that God made use of His hands. This brief myth from 
Avot de-Rabbi Natan describes God using his hands to create a mountain, a man, and a 
Temple. Shloyshe Sheorim explains that God created the world using both of His hands. 

See Creation from a Mold," p. 134, for an alternate account of God creating Adam 
using his hands. For another example of God's use of His hands, see "The Work of 
Creation," p. 90, where God forms the world out of balls of fire and ice, that He crushes 
together. Other examples abound.

34. THE BODY OF GOD 

What is the appearance of God? God is fire and His throne is fire. Clouds and fog sur- 
round him. His face and His cheeks are in the image of the spirit, and therefore no man is 
able to recognize Him. With one eye God sees' from one end of the universe to the other. 
The sparks that go forth from that eye give light to everyone. With the other eye, God 
looks behind Himself to see the future. 

God's splendor fills the universe, luminous and awesome from within the darkness. 
Platoons of anger are to His right and to His left are splendid bolts of beauty and dark- 
ness and cloud, and before him lies a field of stars. His arms are folded. His cheeks are 
like a bed of spices, as it is said. His cheeks are like a bed of spices (S. of S. 5:13). 

When God moves, there move behind him cherubs of fire and hailstones to His right, 
and to His left, the wings of storm and the might of the whirlwind. 

What is the measure of God's body? His little finger fills the entire universe. His tongue 
stretches from the one end of the universe to the other. His mouth is fire consuming fire. 

It is said that whoever knows the measurement of his Creator and the glory of God is 
secure in this world and in the World to Come. He will live long in this world, and live 
long and well in the World to Come. 

Certain mystical texts, especially Shi'ur Komah, describe the body of God in great, 
sometimes ludicrous, detail. Even God's sexual organ is described and its size detailed. 

All of these measurements, given in parasangs, are gigantic. As noted here, "even His 
little finger fills the entire universe." These texts show a strange literalism in which God 
shares the anatomy of a man. The point is that God's size is so large that it cannot be 
imagined, although, in describing God's anatomy in great detail, these texts are in fact 
explicitly imagining it. Were these strange measurements meant to have been taken 
literally? Like all allegorical material in kabbalistic texts, especially in the Zohar, there is 
an ambivalence about this. On the one hand, Shi'ur Komah takes the issue of precise 
measurements very seriously, expanding the myth of God's gigantic body. On the other 
hand, there is a distinct awareness that these texts are also to be understood in allegori- 
cal terms. This represents the antimythological impulses within kabbalah. The central 
dialectic of kabbalah is focused on the debate between these two perspectives, the mythic 



THE NAMES OF COD 25 


and the antimythic. A full understanding of kabbalistic texts requires attention to both 
mythic and allegorical interpretation. Why is allegory anti-mythical? Because it nar- 
rows down the symbolic meaning of a myth to a single, one-dimensional interpretation, 
while myth increasingly expands its symbolic aura.

35. GOD'S BACK 

Moses said to the Lord, "Oh, let me behold Your presence!" And God answered, "I will 
make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim before you the name Lord, 
and the grace that I grant and the compassion that I show. But," He said, "you cannot see 
My face, for man may not see Me and live." And the Lord said, "See, there is a place near 
Me. Station yourself on the rock and, as My Presence passes by, I will put you in a cleft of 
the rock and shield you with My hand until I have passed by. Then I will take My hand 
away and you will see My back; but My face must not be seen." 

This passage from Exodus establishes the principle that "you cannot see My face, for 
man may not see Me and live" (Exod. 33:20). Nevertheless, there are many exceptions to 
this rule, most notably a famous midrash in which Moses ascends on high and speaks to 
God face to face as God is seated upon His throne. See " The Ascent of Moses," p. 261. 

Especially of note here is the notion of God's back. The suggestion that God has a 
face and a back goes far in establishing an anthropomorphic image of God. Of course, 
there is also a strong hint of allegory in this concept — being able to see only God's 
back suggests that much of God's nature must remain unknowable. 

This episode about Moses is largely repeated for Elijah in 1 Kings 19:5-12. See "A 
Still, Small Voice," p. 30.

36. THE GOD OF THE FATHERS 

Moses said to God, "When I come to the Israelites and say to them 'The God of your 
fathers has sent me to you/ and they ask me, 'What is His name?' what shall I say to 
them?" And God said to Moses, " Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh ." He continued, "Thus shall you say 
to the Israelites, 'Ehyeh sent me to you.'" And God said further to Moses, "Thus shall you 
speak to the Israelites: Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of 
Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you: this shall be My name forever, this My 
appellation for all eternity." 



26 MYTHS OF 60D 


In this important passage God reveals His name to Moses. Actually, God reveals 
two names in Exodus 3: "Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh," meaning "I Am That I Am" (or "I Will 
Be What I Will Be") and Yahweh (YHVH). This suggests that the priestly editors of 
Exodus intended to link Yahweh to the God of the patriarchs, although none of them 
knew God by this name, as directly stated in Exodus 6:2-3: God spoke to Moses and said 
to him, "I am the Lord . I appeared to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob as El Shaddai , but I did not 
make myself known to them by My name YHVH (Exod. 6:2-3). The Samaritan text Memar 
Markah 1:4 comments about God's name: "It is a glorious Name that fills the whole of 
creation. The world is bound together by it. All the covenants of the righteous are 
bound together." God is quoted here as saying: "I shall not forget this Covenant as 
long as the world exists. Since you belong to the Most High of the whole world, I have 
revealed My Great Name to you." 

God is identified by a series of names in the Bible. The two primary names are 
YHVH (Yahweh), known as the Tetragrammaton, and Elohim (which is plural, liter- 
ally meaning "Gods"). God reveals his true name, YHVH, to Moses in Exodus 6:2, 
while noting that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob knew Him as "El Shaddai/' God also iden- 
tifies himself to Moses, as noted here, as "I am who I am" (Exod. 3:14). The biblical text 
seems to suggest a connection between the Name YHVH and the phrase Ehyeh-Asher- 
Ehyeh, "I am who I am." The four-letter Name of God is also known as the Shem ha- 
Meforash, "The Ineffable Name." 

The multiplicity of God's names is itself a mystery. Why is a monotheistic God 
known by multiple names? Some of these names, such as "Almighty One," or "the 
Holy One, blessed be He" may simply function as attributes of God. But this does not 
explain the remarkable array of God's names. One possibility is that in the earliest 
stages of Judaism the names of some of the gods of the surrounding cultures were 
attributed to the God of Israel as part of the transformation from polytheism to mono- 
theism. This is an example of what might be termed mythic absorption. This may 
have established the belief that God had many names. In The Old Rabbinic Doctrine of 
God, A. Marmorstein lists ninety-one rabbinic synonyms for God (pp. 54-107). These 
include well-known names such as Elohim ("God" and "gods"), Ruah ha-Kodesh ("the 
Holy Spirit"), Shekhinah ("Divine Presence"), Yotzer Olamim ("Creator of the Worlds"), 
ha-Makom ("the Place"), Tzur Olamim ("Rock of the Worlds"), Shomer Olamim ("Guard- 
ian of the Worlds") and ha-Shem ("the Name"). 

It is YHVH that remains the preeminent name for God in rabbinic and kabbalistic 
lore. Moses was the first and last to hear the Name pronounced by God and the Name 
was said to be inscribed on the staff with which Moses divided the waters of the Red 
Sea. After that, the tradition holds, the true pronunciation of the Name is only known 
by one great sage in every generation. The Maharal (Rabbi Judah Loew of Prague, 
1525-1609), as well as the Ba'al Shem Tov, were said to know it. Having knowledge of 
this true pronunciation of the Name was regarded as bestowing secret, magic powers, 
including mastery of angels, spirits, and demons. Some sources identify the power of 
the Name as limitless. 

Note that masculine and feminine elements are perfectly balanced in the 
Tetragrammaton. The yod has a masculine meaning, the he a feminine one, and the vav 
a masculine character. Thus the name follows the progression of masculine-feminine- 
masculine-feminine.

THE NAMES OF COD 27 


37. THE TETRAGRAMMATON 

All of creation emanates from God's holy Name, YHVH. In the beginning God revealed 
His holy Name within the empty hollow that was created when God contracted Himself. 
Then He radiated the first emanation, which became the source of all subsequent creation. 

YHVH, the four-letter Name of God, is known as the Tetragrammaton. It is one of 
the two most important biblical names of God, along with Elohim. Rabbinic tradition 
considers the Tetragrammaton the essential Name of God. The true pronunciation of 
the Name is believed to have been lost. When the Temple in Jerusalem was still stand- 
ing, the High Priest would go into the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur and pronounce 
the Name. This was the only time it was pronounced. After the destruction of the Temple, 
knowledge of how to pronounce the Name was carefully guarded. One tradition holds 
that only one great sage in each generation knows the true pronunciation. This righ- 
teous man is known as the Tzaddik ha-Dor, the greatest sage of his generation. Among 
those who were said to have known how to pronounce the Name was the legendary 
Rabbi Adam, as well as Rabbi Judah Loew (the Maharal) and the Ba'al Shem Tov. 

In Jewish folklore the Name is sometimes used to bring the dead to life, as in Ma 'aseh 
Buck no. 171, where a dead man is brought to life by a rabbi in order to confess his 
crime. See "The Dead Man's Accusation" in Lilith's Cave , pp. 109-110. A similar use of 
the Name is found in Megillat Ahimaaz, where a young man who has died has the 
Tetragrammaton, written on a piece of parchment, sewn into his arm, making him a 
kind of living dead. See "A Young Man Without a Soul" in Gabriel's Palace , pp. 145-148. 

More often, the Tetragrammaton is pronounced in order to accomplish a miracle. For 
example, there is an oral tale collected in the Balkans about Rabbi Shimon ben Duran 
(1361-1444), who is said to have drawn a picture of a ship on a cell wall, and then 
brought the ship to life by pronouncing the Name. See "Rabbi Shimon's Escape" in 
Gabriel's Palace , pp. 126-127. See "The God of the Fathers," p. 25.

38. THE LORD OF HOSTS 

Once, when Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, the High Priest, went into the Holy of Holies of the 
Temple to offer incense, he looked up and saw Akatriel Yah, the Lord of Hosts, seated on a 
high and exalted throne. And the Lord spoke to him and said: "Ishmael, My son, bless me." 
And Rabbi Ishmael raised his hands in a blessing, and said: "May it be Your will that Your 
mercy overcomes Your justice, and may Your children be blessed with Your compassion." 
And when Rabbi Ishmael raised his eyes, the Lord inclined His head toward him. 

This tale is a talmudic reworking of a biblical incident, exemplifying the pattern of 
retellings that continues through postbiblical Jewish literature. Here the biblical ac- 
count of Moses speaking with God inside the Tent of Meeting is reworked into a tale 
of the High Priest having a vision of God in the Holy of Holies. This extends the link 
to the divine for another generation. In the biblical version, Moses does not see God, 
but speaks to him: When Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with him , he would 



28 MYTHS OF &lt;&amp;OD 


hear the Voice addressing him from above the cover that was on top of the Ark of the Covenant 
between the two cherubim ; thus He spoke to him (Num. 7:89). 

At the same time. Rabbi Ishmael's vision is strikingly parallel to that of Isaiah: I 
beheld Yahweh seated on a high and lofty throne; and the skirts of His robe filled the temple 
(Isa. 6:1). This indicates how talmudic myths and legends emerge from the cauldron 
of biblical archetypes. See "Isaiah's Vision," p. 3. 

This talmudic tale grows out of traditions linked to the Temple in Jerusalem. No 
one was permitted to enter the Holy of Holies in the Temple except for the High Priest, 
and then only on Yom Kippur. This talmudic legend recounts how Rabbi Ishmael, the 
High Priest, had a vision of God inside the Holy of Holies. The name he attributes to 
God, Akatriel Yah, the Lord of Hosts ( Yahweh Tzevaot) is a very strange one, leaving 
open the possibility that this might be the name of an angelic figure. However, the 
traditional readings of this tale have always identified Akatriel Yah as one of the many 
names of God. Most remarkable is God's request to Rabbi Ishmael — that Ishmael bless 
God, rather than the reverse. This makes it one of the primary examples of the rab- 
binic tradition by which God is portrayed as dependent, in some ways, on His cre- 
ation. See "The Rabbis Overrule God," p. 67. Rabbi Ishmael does bless Akatriel Yah, 
and in return the Lord of Hosts nods his approval. 

At the root of this myth is the belief, of primitive origin, that there is a kind of 
interdependence between man and God. This is best represented by the nature of 
sacrifices that were made to God. An offering was burned, the smoke of the sacrifice 
ascended on high, and if the offering was received, fire descended from heaven and con- 
sumed the burnt offering (2 Chron. 7:3). Other evidence of this tradition is found in the 
legend of the angel Sandalphon, who is said to weave the prayers of Israel into crowns 
of prayers for the Holy One to wear on His Throne of Glory (B. Hagigah 13b). Here, 
however, the tradition has been modified to the extent that God wears the crowns of 
prayer not because He needs to in order to be complete, but out of a great love that He 
holds for the prayers of Israel. 

There is considerable debate over the identity of Akatriel Yah, who is identified as 
"The Lord of Hosts," Yahweh Tzevaot. Ancient readers saw this as a name for God 
Himself. Later commentators identified Akatriel Yah as an angel like Michael or Gabriel. 
This suggests that there were different, or at least evolving, traditions about Akatriel. 
It is also said that Akatriel's name is inscribed on God's throne, suggesting that ac- 
cording to one tradition, it was this name rather than that of the Tetragrammaton that 
was God's primary secret name. 

In The Mystery of Sandalphon, Akatriel Yah is described as sitting at the entrance of 
Paradise, with 120 angels surrounding him. Here it is Akatriel rather than Metatron 
that Elisha ben Abuyah sees seated in Paradise. However, since Akatriel is described 
as being at the entrance of Paradise, this implies that his position is inferior to that of 
Metatron, who is found in the highest heavens in B . Hagigah 14b. See "A Vision of 
Metatron," p. 174. 

The blessing that Rabbi Ishmael gives to God is identical to what is described as 
God's prayer earlier in B. Berakhot 7a. See "God's Prayer," p. 35.

THE WARRIOR COD 29 


39. GOD'S ROBE OF GLORY 

Some say that God's robe of glory is engraved inside and outside, and entirely covered with 
God's holy Name, YHVH. No eyes are able to behold it, not eyes of flesh and blood, nor even 
the eyes of the angels. Whoever beholds it, whoever glimpses it, is consumed in fire. 

Others say that God's robe of glory is inscribed with all the words of the Torah, and 
that God wrapped himself in this magnificent garment at the time of the singing of the 
Song of the Sea. 

Here the prohibition against seeing God is extended to seeing God's garment. His 
robe of glory. Covered entirely with the Tetragrammaton, this robe is also described 
as having the characteristics of God: "a quality of holiness, a quality of power, a qual- 
ity of awe, a quality of terror." This description of God's garment comes from one of 
the hymns of Hekhalot Rabbati, known as "The Greater Hekhalot" 

In Razi Li , God is said to have wrapped Himself in a garment inscribed with all the 
words of the Torah at the time of the singing of the Song of the Sea (Exod. 15). This 
tradition is attributed to Rabbi Akiba. 

Another tradition holds that God's garment is made of light. See "God's Garment 
of Light," p. 82.

40. THE WARRIOR GOD 

Yahweh is a mighty warrior who defeated Pharaoh at the Red Sea. It is said that God 
smote them with His finger, as it is said. And the magicians said to Pharaoh , " This is the finger 
of God" (Exod. 8:15). 

Others say that God appeared to Pharaoh as a mighty warrior, carrying a fiery bow, 
with a sword of lightning, traveling through the heavens in a chariot. When Pharaoh 
shot arrows at Israel, God shot fiery arrows back. When Pharaoh's army cast rocks, God 
brought hail. And when Pharaoh shot fiery arrows from a catapult, God deluged them 
with burning coals. Finally Pharaoh exhausted his entire armory. Then God took a cherub 
from His Throne of Glory and rode upon it, waging war against Pharaoh and Egypt, as it 
is said. He mounted a cherub and flew (Ps. 18:11). Leaping from one wing to another, God 
taunted Pharaoh, "O evil one, do you have a cherub? Can you do this?" 

When the angels saw that God was waging war against the Egyptians on the sea, they 
came to His aid. Some came carrying swords and others carrying bows or lances. God 
said to them, "I do not need your aid, for when I go out to battle, I go alone." That is why 
it is said that Yahweh is a man of war (Exod. 15:3). 

The intensely mythic description of God riding upon a cherub is found in Psalms 
18:11, He rode upon a cherub and did fly. This image was embellished in later rabbinic 
texts. Confirming the image of God as a great warrior traveling through the heavens 
in a chariot. Exodus Rabbah 5:14 states that God's bow was fire. His arms flame. His 
spear a torch, the clouds His shield, and His sword, lightning. The parallels to Zeus 
and the warrior gods of the Near East are clear. Note that the fiery portrayal of God 
strongly resembles the sun, and may well be a remnant of sun worship that survives 



30 MYTHS OF COD 


in Judaism. A parallel kind of sun worship can also be seen in the myths surrounding 
Enoch's transformation into Metatron. One of the angels listed in Sefer ha-Razim is 
Helios, the Greek sun god. This also indicates a possible remnant of sun worship in 
Judaism. 

In addition to Exodus 15:3, Yahweh is a man of war , God is described as a warrior in 
Psalm 24: Who is the King of glory?— Yahweh, mighty and valiant , Yahweh, valiant in battle 
(Ps. 24:8). Frank Moore Cross finds in this passage a strong echo of the Canaanite 
pattern, in which both El and Ba'al are described as a warrior gods. The ideology of 
holy war is also found in Numbers 10:35: Advance, O Lord! May Your enemies be scat- 
tered, and may Your foes flee before you!

41. GOD'S SWORD 

When God opens the book that is half fire, half ice, avenging angels go forth to execute 
judgment on the wicked with God's sword, drawn from its sheath. Its splendor shines 
like lightning and pervades the world from one end to the other, with sparks and flashes 
the size of the stars going forth, as it is said. When I whet My flashing blade (Deut. 32:41). 

The book that is half fire, half ice echoes the myth the Books of Life and Death that 
God opens on Yom Kippur. See "The Book of Life and the Book of Death," p. 289. This 
myth offers God's sword as a metaphor for the execution of his judgments. The image 
here is of a harsh God, who sees to it that His judgments are immediately carried out.

42. A STILL, SMALL VOICE 

Elijah lay down and fell asleep under a broom bush. Suddenly an angel touched him and 
said to him, "Arise and eat." He looked about; and there, beside his head, was a cake 
baked on hot stones and a jar of water! He ate and drank, and lay down again. The angel 
of the Lord came a second time and touched him and said, "Arise and eat, or the journey 
will be too much for you." He arose and ate and drank; and with the strength from the 
meal he walked forty days and forty nights as far as the mountain of God at Horeb. There 
he went into a cave, and there he spent the night. 

Then the word of the Lord came to him. He said to him, "Why are you here, Elijah?" 
He replied, "I am moved by the zeal for the Lord, the God of Hosts, for the Israelites have 
forsaken Your covenant, tom down Your altars, and put Your prophets to the sword. I 
alone am left, and they are out to take my life." "Come out," He called, "and stand on the 
mountain before the Lord." 



COD'S VOKE AND WORD 31 


And lo, the Lord passed by. There was a great and mighty wind, splitting mountains 
and shattering rocks by the power of the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind. After 
the wind— an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake — 
fire; but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire — a still, small voice. When Elijah 
heard it, he wrapped his mantle about his face and went out and stood at the entrance of 
the cave. Then a voice addressed him. 

This is a famous and profound biblical passage in which Elijah does not find God 
in all the obvious places — not in the wind, and not in the earthquake, and not in the 
fire, but in a still, small voice. The implication seems to be that Elijah hears that voice 
within himself, and thus makes contact with God in this way. This might indicate a 
new stage in the understanding of God, in which God is sought and found within. 

There are many parallels between the stories of Moses and Elijah, suggesting that 
the author of the Elijah narrative consciously shaped it to echo that of Moses. This 
episode has striking parallels with that of Moses' supreme revelation of God in Exo- 
dus 33:17-23, where God passes by Moses as he is inside the cave, and Moses is able to 
glimpse God's back. Elijah, like Moses, goes into the desert for 40 days and nights and 
arrives at Mount Horeb, which is Sinai. Further, the text strongly implies, this is the 
very same cave where Moses had his revelation. In both accounts there is storm wind, 
quaking, and fire on Sinai and both Moses and Elijah have a major revelation of God. 

For the account of Moses's vision, see "God's Back," p. 25.

43. GOD'S VOICE 

God saved His full voice for a thousand generations. God did not create the heavens with 
this voice. Nor did He create the earth with this voice. When was God's full voice heard? 
When God gave the Torah at Mount Sinai. When God spoke the whole earth became 
silent. The birds ceased to sing, and all the fowl stopped flying, the beasts of the earth 
were quiet and the oxen did not low; the wheels of the Chariot of the Lord did not re- 
volve, and the angels were hushed, as was the sea. It was a silence such as had never 
been before and will never be again. 

Some say that then God's voice went forth and echoed throughout the world, as it is 
said. And the people perceived the voices (Exod. 20:15). And all the people who were in the 
camp trembled, and the earth shook, and the heavens fell down, and the mountains flowed. 
Israel first heard God's voice coming from the South, so they ran in that direction. Then 
they heard it coming from the North, so they ran that way. Soon after this they heard it 
coming from the East, and they turned in that direction. Then they heard it coming from 
the West, and they turned that way. All at once they heard the voice coming from the 
heavens, and they looked up. Then they heard it coming from the earth, and they looked 
down. In this way they learned that no one knows where God is hidden. 

Others say that not only did God's voice come to them from everywhere, but God 
revealed Himself to them from all four directions. 

It is said that each one heard God's voice according to his ability. The old men accord- 
ing to their ability, and the young men according to theirs, and the women according to 
theirs, and the children and the infants according to theirs, and even Moses according to 
his, so that each and every one would be able to endure it. 



32 MYTHS OF COD 


As soon as the words issued from the mouth of God they became fire and flew upon the 
wind, and appeared in the sight of all the people. Then the angels of the Lord descended 
and took the words of God and brought them to each of the children of Israel and told them 
of the sanctity of the divine utterance. So too did God's voice split into seven voices, and 
from these seven into seventy languages, and traveled to the ends of the earth, and entered 
into the heart of every man. When the voice came forth, each nation heard the voice of God, 
and its soul departed from it, but Israel was not harmed, as it is said. Has any people heard the 
voice of God speaking out of afire, as you have , and survived? (Deut. 4:33). 

The notion that God saved His voice for the giving of the Torah is problematic, in 
that God created the world by speaking the words, " Let there be light," in Genesis 1:3. 

So too does God communicate with Abraham by speaking to him on several occasions. 

The rabbis seem to be making a fine distinction between "speaking" and "a voice." In 
any case, God's voice is an overwhelmingly powerful presence at Mount Sinai. The 
description of God's voice coming from all directions is based on several biblical verses, 
especially From the heavens He let you hear His voice to discipline you; on earth He let you 
see His great fire; and from amidst that fire you heard His words (Deut. 4:36), and God 
thunders marvelously with His voice (Job 37:5). The idea that God's voice was heard and 
understood by each according to his ability derives from the verse Moses would speak , 
and God would answer him in a voice (Exod. 19:19). In this passage, "a voice" seems to 
indicate that each person would hear it in a different way. This becomes emblematic 
of the teachings of the Torah to be understood differently by different individuals, 
according to their knowledge and ability. 

Exodus Rabbah 34:1 comments on this: "God only comes to them according to their 
power. When God gave the Torah to Israel, if He had come to them in the fullness of 
His power they would not have been able to withstand it. But He only came to them 
according to their power." 

The tradition that the people of Israel heard God speak in many different voices 
raises the question of whether what they heard were the voices of many gods. Exodus 
Rabbah 29:1 replies to this concern: "God said to Israel: 'Do not think because you heard 
many voices that there are many gods. But know that I alone am the Lord your God.'" 

Likewise, God is said to have appeared to the people with many different faces. 

Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 21:6 considers this issue in a similar way to that of God's voice: 

"God appeared to them at Sinai with many faces: a defiant face, a joyous face, a laugh- 
ing face, a kind and friendly face.... If a heretic says, "There are two different gods,' 
answer him: 'It is not written the gods (Elohim) have spoken face after face, but the 
Lord (YHVH) spoke with you face to face (Deut. 5:4).'" 

There is a rabbinic tradition that God's voice is still speaking from Mount Sinai. In 
Leviticus Rabbah 16:4, Ben Azzai tells Rabbi Akiba that he is hearing the words of the 
Torah and that they "are joyful even as they were on the day they were given at Sinai." 

The Ba'al Shem Tov believed that if the people of Israel sanctify and purify themselves, 
they will always merit hearing the voice of God speaking to them as He did at Sinai 
(Keter Torah , Yitro). One story about the Ba'al Shem Tov recounts how when he taught 
schoolchildren, he caused them to experience the Giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai, 
with the thunder and lightning. Later, at the time of Shavuot, when he spoke to them 
about the Giving of the Torah, he asked them if they remembered that event. All of them 
said yes, except for one, who eventually left the path of Judaism ( Kovetz Eliyahu, edited 
by Hayim Eliyahu Sternberg). In Esh Kadosh, Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira (1889- 
1943) asserts, "Even now the voice of the Torah can be heard emerging everywhere, 
from within one's own body as well as from the entire outside world." Hizkuni claimed 
to have heard the voice of God pronouncing the Ten Commandments in a dream. 

In his biblical commentary. Rabbi Yehudah Leib Alter of Ger, known as the Sefat 
Emet, comments about the verse All the people saw the voices (Ex. 20:15) that each of the 
people of Israel saw the divine soul within themselves, which was the root of his or 
her own life-force. Thus they did not require a leap of faith to believe the command- 
ments, because they saw the voices. 



COD'S VOICE AND WORD 33 


In his Torah Discourses, Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Riminov expressed doubt 
that, "given the constrains of human understanding, whether it is possible to compre- 
hend the notion of speech with regard to God." He explained that "God's speech can 
only be understood as a revelation of His inner will." According to the Riminov Rebbe, 
only Moses experienced God's true speech, by "drawing directly from God's holiness 
to his own inner core." That is the meaning of the verse about Moses, The Lord would 
speak to Moses face to face (Exod. 33:11).

Torah," p. 260.

44. GOD'S IMAGE 

When God made His voice heard at Mount Sinai, all of Israel were listening and fearful. 
They said to Moses, "Draw near and listen, for we are afraid to do so." So Moses drew 
near to the holy deep darkness where the Divine One was, and he saw the wonders of the 
unseen, a sight no one else could see. God's image dwelt on him, the very face of God. 
How terrifying to anyone who beholds it, for no one is able to stand before it. With his 
hands Moses received the signature of God, and it was a treasure-house of all knowl- 
edge. His body mingled with the angels above and he dwelt with them, being worthy of 
doing so. His speech was like the speech of the Lord. His voice mingled with the voice of 
the Lord, and he was magnified above all the human race. 

This is a Samaritan myth about Moses approaching God on Mount Sinai and seeing 
God's image — the ultimate experience of seeing God face to face. As important as Moses 
is in Jewish tradition, he is elevated even higher in Samaritan tradition, to a near-divine 
status. Indeed, it was the rabbinic fear of Moses being regarded as a messianic figure 
that led the rabbis to minimize his role in the Exodus in the Passover Haggadah. The 
image of God that Moses sees is a reference to Genesis 1:27: In the image of God He created 
them. Humans were created in God's image, but here Moses is able to see not only 
God's reflection, but God's actual image; thus he is able to encounter God face to face.

45. THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL BEHOLD GOD 

Then God said to Moses, "Come up to the Lord, with Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and 70 
elders of Israel, and bow low from afar. Moses alone shall come near the Lord; but the 
others shall not come near, nor shall the people come up with him. . . Then Moses and 
Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy elders of Israel ascended, and they saw the God 
of Israel: under His feet there was the likeness of a pavement of sapphire, like the very 
sky for purity. Yet He did not raise His hand against the leaders of the Israelites; they 
beheld God, and they ate and drank. 

Although God warns Moses at one point that "Yow cannot see My face, for man may 
not see me and live" (Exod. 33:20), in Exodus 24 God invites Moses to bring Aaron, his 
sons, and 70 of the elders of Israel to Mount Sinai, and there God reveals Himself to 
them. Further, they are permitted to eat and drink in God's presence. This takes place 



34 MYTHS OF COD 


just before Moses ascends Mount Sinai to receive the Torah, and the purpose of as- 
cending with them is to convince the elders that God truly exists, and that the Torah 
God is about to reveal is a work of truth. 

Rashi comments that because they saw God, they deserved death, but God did not 
want to mar the rejoicing of the receiving of the Torah.

46. GOD STUDIES THE TORAH 

God is occupied in studying the Torah day and night, as it is said, A God of knowledge is the 
Lord (1 Sam. 2:3). This means that God studies the Written Torah by day and the Oral 
Torah at night. When He studies the Written Torah by day. His face is as radiant as snow, 
and when He studies the Oral Torah at night, his face is ruddy. 

According to this myth, God studies the very texts that are the primary focus of 
Jewish study. The description of God's face alludes to the verse My beloved is white and 
ruddy, from the Song of Songs 5:10. This is based on Rabbi Akiba's reading of the Song 
of Songs not as an erotic love poem or poems, but as an allegory of God's love for 
Israel, in which God is identified as the Bridegroom and Israel as the bride. 

Here God is said to study both the Written and the Oral Torah. The first five books 
of the Torah are known as the Written Torah. According to Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 46, 

God dictated the Torah to Moses during the day and at night He explained it to him. 

These nightly explanations are known as the Oral Torah, and in time it came to be 
identified with the Talmud, which was understood to contain within itself the Oral 
Torah. 

Nor does God limit his study to the Written and Oral Torah. He also studies the 
interpretations of the sages, as recounted in B. Hagigah 15b, where it is reported that 
Rabbah bar Shila once encountered Elijah and asked him, "What is the Holy One, 
blessed be He, doing?" Elijah replied, "He is saying the teachings of each of the sages." 

For other examples of God's observance of Jewish ritual, see "God Puts on Tallit 
and Tefillin," p. 34, and "God Keeps the Sabbath," p. 314.

47. GOD PUTS ON TALLIT AND TEFILLIN 

God dons tallit and tefillin. How is this known? That God dons a tallit is known from the 
verse. Who covers Yourself with light as with a garment (Ps. 104:2). That God puts on tefillin is 
known from the verse Yahweh has sworn by His right hand, and by the arm of his strength (Isa. 
62:8). Here, by His right hand refers to the Torah, and by the arm of His strength refers to the 
tefillin. 

Indeed, it was God who taught Moses how to tie the knot of the tefillin. 

What is written in God's tefillin ? Who is like Your people Israel, a unique nation on earth (1 
Chron. 17:21). 

Some say that the angel Michael binds tefillin to God's head each day, while others say 
that this is done by Metatron, and still others say that it is done by Sandalphon. 



COD STUDIES THE TORAH 35 


In a series of myths, God is portrayed taking part in the same prayer rituals as the 
men of Israel. God prays, puts on a tallit, a prayer shawl with fringed garments (tzitzit), 
and puts on tefillin, the phylacteries that men don for the morning prayer service. 
What is the point of God taking part in such rituals? This creates a parallel in the ritual 
practices of God and of His people, Israel, as well as a sense of mutuality, an indica- 
tion that God gives back the prayers that He receives. 

The knowledge that God teaches Moses how to knot tefillin is linked to the verse 
Then I will take My hand away and you will see My back (Exod. 33:23). This is certainly a 
mysterious verse, with two strongly personified elements of God, His hand and His 
back. But it seems a long way to link this to God teaching Moses how to tie the knot of 
the tefillin. 

The central text inside the tefillin is the Shema, from Deuteronomy 6:4-9. This is an 
unambiguous statement of devotion to God: Hear , O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is 
one. And the text described as being inside God's tefillin , Who is like Your people Israel, a 
unique nation on earth? (1 Chron. 17:21), is a clear statement of God's devotion to Israel. 
Together the two texts form a kind of ketubah — a wedding contract. They are a further 
example of the covenant between God and Israel. See "The Wedding of God and Is- 
rael," p. 305. For other examples of God performing Jewish ritual activity, see "God 
Studies the Torah," p. 34, and "God Keeps the Sabbath," p. 314.

48. GOD'S TABERNACLE 

From the very beginning God made a tabernacle for Himself in Jerusalem, as it is said, 
Shalem became His abode (Ps. 76:3). That is the place where God would confer with Himself 
in prayer. 

Ever since the tabernacle was destroyed, God prays for His children to do penitence, 
so that He may hasten the rebuilding of His house and His Temple, and spread the Tab- 
ernacle of peace over all His people Israel, and over Jerusalem. 

This myth not only reaffirms that God prays, but establishes Jerusalem (using the 
ancient name, Shalem) as the place where God made a tabernacle for Himself. The 
notion that God would create His own tabernacle and pray to Himself is strange. But 
who else would God pray to?

49. GOD'S PRAYER 

How do we know that God prays? From the verse I will bring them to My sacred mount , and 
let them rejoice in My house of prayer (Isa. 56:7). It does not state "their house of prayer," but 
"My house of prayer." Therefore it can be seen that God says prayers. 



36 MYTHS OF COD 


What is God's prayer? It is, "May it be My will that My mercy overcome My anger, 
and that My mercy dominate My attributes. May I act toward My children with the at- 
tribute of mercy, and go beyond the strict measure of the law." 

This is one in a series of myths about God participating in the same prayer rituals as 
His people, Israel. See also "God Studies the Torah," p. 34; "God Puts on Tallit and 
TefiUin," p. 34; and "God's Tabernacle," p. 35. Here God is portrayed as praying. Other 
myths describe God as singing praises of Israel, just as Israel sings praises of God. 

Note that the prayer that is described as God's prayer — to Himself presumably — is 
similar to the blessing that Rabbi Ishmael makes to God when he has a vision of Akatriel 
Yah — one of God's names — while in the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur, also found in 
the same talmudic source. See "The Lord of Hosts," p. 27.

50. GOD EXPOUNDS THE TORAH 

In the future God is destined to sit in the Garden of Eden and interpret the Torah. All the 
righteous in the world will sit before Him, with all the household of heaven sitting at 
their feet. At the right hand of God will be the sun, the moon, and the planets, and at His 
left hand will be all the stars. Then God will expound the new Torah, which God is des- 
tined to give them at the hands of the Messiah. 

In the messianic era, the Messiah will transmit a new Torah to Israel that he re- 
ceived from God. Then God Himself will expound the Torah in heaven, before all the 
righteous and the other inhabitants of heaven, including the angels. Thus God is here 
demonstrated to be the final authority on the Torah, since, after all, God created it. 

This myth is also a part of a larger myth cluster in which God's actions mirror those of 
observant Jews — God not only prays, puts on tallit and tefillin, and studies the Torah, 
but He even teaches the Torah, demonstrating that He is the Master of masters. The 
new Torah that God teaches is appropriate to the postmessianic world, which will be 
considerably transformed. See "A New Torah," p. 522.

51. THE SUFFERING GOD 

When a Jew is afflicted, God suffers much more than the person does, as it is said. In all 
their troubles He was troubled (Isa. 63:9). For God is not subject to any limitation, and there- 
fore His suffering is also boundless. It is impossible even to conceive such suffering. If 
the world ever heard God's weeping, and realized the extent of His grief, it would ex- 
plode. Even a spark of His suffering would be more than the world could bear. 

From the day the Temple was destroyed and Jerusalem made desolate, there has been 
no joy before God. Nor will there be any joy until God rebuilds Jerusalem and returns 
Israel into its midst. 

God weeps in the inner chambers of heaven. Three times a day a divine voice, like the 
cooing of a dove, goes forth, saying, "Woe to My children. Because of their sins I destroyed 
My house and burnt My temple and exiled them among the nations." And three times a 
night, during the three watches, God sits and roars like a lion, repeating the same words of 
grief, as it is said, Yahweh roars from on high , and thunders from His holy dwelling (Jer. 25:30). 



THE SUFFERING COD 37 


And whenever Jews go into the synagogues and pray, "May His Name be blessed," 
God shakes his head and says, "Happy is the king who is praised in this house. Woe to 
the father who had to banish his children, and to the children who had to be banished 
from their father's table." 


In tractate Berakhot of the Talmud, Rabbi Yose enters a min in Jerusalem to pray 
and hears God giving voice to His grief over the destruction of the Temple and the 
exile of Israel. Upon leaving the min, he meets Elijah, who tells him that God grieves 
thus three times a day— a clear reference to the daily prayers in the morning ( Shaharit ), 
the late afternoon (Minhah), and the evening (Ma'ariv). In effect, this is God's prayer. 
And Elijah reveals to Rabbi Yose that when Israel responds with the words, "May His 
Name be blessed" — a traditional response — God shakes his head in both joy and griev- 
ing: joy that His children haven't forgotten Him, and grief over His decision to de- 
stroy the Temple and send His children into exile. 

In a derashah (a discussion of a portion of the Torah, usually delivered on the Sab- 
bath), Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira emphasizes the impossibility of any person 
being able to conceive God's infinite suffering, much less to endure it. For God feels 
guilty not only about the disaster He brought upon Israel, but He also wants to atone 
for their sins. Rabbi Shapira attributes Rabbi Yose's ability to hear God's words to the 
fact that he was standing in a min in Jerusalem, which annihilated his sense of self, 
making it possible to hear God's voice. This echoes the still, small voice of God that 
Elijah hears in the entrance to a cave (1 Kings 19:12). See "A Still, Small Voice," p. 30. 
For other examples of God's expressions of grief, see "God's Tears," p. 37 and "God 
Weeps Over the Destruction of the Temple," p. 38.

52. GOD'S TEARS 

When God remembers His children, who dwell in misery among the nations. He lets fall 
two tears into the ocean, and the sound is heard from one end of the world to the other. 
So too when God remembers how the Shekhinah lies in the dust of the earth, does He shed 
tears hot as fire, that fall down into the Great Sea. 

Others say that in the hour that God cries, five rivers of tears issue from the five fin- 
gers of His right hand, and fall into the Great Sea and shake the world. 

Many human characteristics are attributed to God, even weeping. Here God weeps 
remembering the suffering of his children, Israel. Just as God's size is enormous (see 
"The Body of God," p. 24), so too are God's tears. Even more surreal is the image of 
God weeping rivers of tears from the fingers of His right hand. Implicit in this weep- 
ing is both God's helplessness and His need for comfort, which clearly seems to con- 
tradict God's omnipotent role as creator and ruler of the world. 



38 MYTHS OF COD 


Zohar 1:26b explains that God's tears roll down to the great sea because Moses 
brought the Torah down in two tablets, but Israel was not worthy of them and they 
broke and fell, causing the destruction of the first and second Temples. In the Pro- 
logue to the Zohar 56, Rahab, the Angel of the Sea, is said to be sustained by God's 
tears. 

The falling of God's tears into the ocean is also given as an explanation for earth- 
quakes. See "What Causes Earthquakes?", p. 102.

53. GOD WEEPS OVER THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TEMPLE 

When the Temple was destroyed and Israel banished, God wept bitterly day and night, 
saying, "Woe is Me! What have I done? I caused My Shekhinah to dwell on earth for the 
sake of Israel, but now that they have sinned, I have returned to My former habitation. 
As below, so above — in both there is weeping over what has come to pass. You weep in 
the night, but I weep day and night, for My presence knows no sleep." 

Then God hung sackcloth over the entrance of His house, rent his purple garment and 
went barefoot. So too did God extinguish the lamps, withdrawing the light of the sun 
and the moon and the stars. And God sat silently and lamented over the Temple. He 
alone knew of the precious spiritual treasures hidden there. 

At that time Metatron, the Prince of the Presence, came before the Lord, fell upon his 
face, and spoke before Him: "Master of the Universe! Do not weep. Let me weep instead 
of You." 

God replied, "If you do not let Me weep now, I will go to a place where you do not 
have permission to enter, and I will weep there." 

This is a myth of great divine distress, agony, and regret. At the same time, the 
myth demonstrates God's grief over the chain of events that led to the destruction of 
the Temple and the exile of the Jews. 

Although God permitted the destruction of the Temple to take place (and in some 
myths was the cause of this catastrophe), here he faces the consequences of His ac- 
tions and weeps. Metatron, who normally substitutes for God in many respects, is so 
disturbed at the sight of God weeping that he begs to weep for God instead. Metatron's 
response indicates the rabbinic discomfort at the notion of God weeping. Despite 
Metatron's offer, God is so distraught that He is ready to go off alone to weep. The 
place Metatron is not permitted to enter is the Pargod , the heavenly curtain, behind 
which only God and the Shekhinah can go. This is God's inner sanctum. God's insis- 
tence that he will continue to weep is explained by the verse For if you will not give 
heed, My inmost self must weep, because of your arrogance (Jer. 13:17). 

In Esh Kadosh Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira proposes that the reason the world 
was not destroyed by God's suffering over the afflictions of Israel and the destruction 
of the Temple is because God wept in secret, in his innermost chamber. For had his 
grief penetrated to this world, it would no longer exist. 

God's garment is described as purple, referring to the imperial purple garments 
worn by kings. Indeed, throughout God behaves in mourning as would a human king.

54. GOD'S LAMENT AT THE WESTERN WALL 

God's grief over the destruction of the Temple was boundless. Once Rabbi Tzadok en- 
tered the Temple area and saw the destroyed Temple. He said, "Heavenly Father, You 
destroyed Your city and burned Your Temple, but now You are tranquil and untroubled." 
Before long Rabbi Tzadok dozed off, and that is when he saw God standing there in the 
Temple, lamenting, with the ministering angels lamenting with him. 

On another occasion. Rabbi Nathan entered the Temple area and found the Temple de- 
stroyed, with only the Kotel, the Western Wall, still standing. He wondered what the sur- 
vival of that wall signified, and he heard a voice say, "Take your ring and press it against 
the wall." Rabbi Nathan did this, and he felt through the ring that the wall was trembling, 
trembling because of the presence of God. At that instant Rabbi Nathan saw God bow 
down at the wall and straighten up and weep, and He did this over and over, lamenting. 

This myth not only confirms God's great grief over the destruction of the Temple 
in Jerusalem, but it also conveys just how holy is the Kotel , the western retaining wall 
of the Temple Mount, which the myth seems to treat as a wall of the Temple itself. 

Most important is Rabbi Nathan's vision of God praying at the wall. This confirms the 
immense sanctity associated with the Kotel. Accounts of God praying at the Western 
Wall are very unusual, while there are many reports of sightings of the Shekhinah, the 
Divine Presence, who made her home in the Temple before it was destroyed. The 
Shekhinah is often envisioned as a mourning dove or as an old woman dressed in 
black, or sometimes as a spirit hovering above the wall. See "The Creation of the 
Temple," p. 420, and "A Vision at the Wailing Wall," p. 63.

55. GOD'S OATH 

Once, when Rabbah bar Bar Hannah was traveling in a caravan, he met an Arab mer- 
chant who offered to show him Mount Sinai. When they arrived there, Rabbah heard a 
heavenly voice crying, "Woe is Me. I have sworn to exile My children, and now that I 
have made the oath, who can absolve Me of it?" 

When Rabbah returned from his journey and told the other rabbis of his experience, 
they screamed at him, "You fool! You should have cried out, 'I absolve You of Your oath!'" 

The legendary travels of Rabbah bar Bar Hannah include this journey to Mount 
Sinai, where Rabbah hears God bemoaning the oath He took to send Israel into exile. 
According to Jewish law, an oath must be fulfilled and cannot be broken unless some- 
one absolves the one who made it. Here Rabbah had an opportunity to absolve God 
of His oath, but foolishly failed to do so. Had he absolved Him, the exile of Israel 
would have come to an end.

40 MYTHS OF &lt;&amp;OD 


56. GOD CONSIDERS ENDING ALL EXISTENCE 

When the Temple was destroyed and Israel exiled from the land, God departed to the 
higher realms and He did not look upon the destruction of the Temple, or upon His 
people, who had gone into exile. 

In that dark time, when the children of Israel wept by the rivers of Babylon, their cries 
reached the highest heavens, where God and all the angels heard them. Then God yearned 
to return all of existence to chaos and desolation. God said, "The world I created, I cre- 
ated with My two hands alone. Now I shall return it to chaos. I will bring heaven and 
earth together, smiting one against the other, and thus destroy the entire world, all of it; 
and not merely the earth, but the heavens as well, as it is said, "I, too , will strike hand 
against hand and will satisfy My fury upon you " (Ezek. 21:22). 

The angels understood that all of existence was on the verge of coming to an end, and 
that God was about to turn even the Throne of Glory upside down. Then all of the min- 
istering angels came before God and said, "Master of the Universe, is it not enough for 
You that You have already destroyed the Temple, Your dwelling place on earth? Will You 
also destroy Your dwelling place in heaven?" 

God replied, "Do I need comforting? If I kindle but one spark, I can make the world, 
which I created, perish. I existed before the world was created, and I existed when the 
world was created, and I will continue to exist, whatever the fate of the world. Verily, I 
know the beginning and I know the end. Leave My presence." 

This dark myth shows God contemplating ending all existence, not only on earth, 
but even in heaven. Since God had created the world only for the sake of Israel, Israel's 
cries of suffering during the Babylonian exile, not long after the destruction of the 
Temple and the defeat of Jerusalem, bring the purpose of the world's continuing ex- 
istence into question. This myth portrays a God who seems human in his deep emo- 
tional reaction, who comes very close to ending all existence in that bleak moment. 

That is when the angels, whose existence is also being threatened, intercede, but God's 
initial reaction to them is one of contempt and anger — "Do I need comforting?" God 
is not flesh and blood, and therefore needs no comforting. "Verily, I know the begin- 
ning and the end" suggests that God is not going to act on impulse, but that He alone 
knows His intended plan for existence, from the time of Creation to the End of Days. 

Even though this response to the angels is abrupt and contemptuous, it also seems to 
suggest that God has remembered His original plan for the world and has decided not 
to act on impulse and end all existence. 

God's reply to the angels, "I know the beginning and I know the end," is elaborated 
in Eliyahu Rabbah 1:3: "God knows both the beginning and the end and can tell from the 
beginning what the end of anything will be like, long, long before it comes to be." 

Rabbi Hayim of Volozhin is clear that all of existence depends on God: "The entire 
universe owes its continued existence to the will of God. If God were to rescind His will 
to maintain the world, it would instantly revert to nothingness" ( Nefesh ha-Hayim 3:1).

57. GOD WALKS IN THE GARDEN 

And they heard the voice of the Lord walking in the garden toward the cool of day. 

This is the most anthropomorphic depiction of God in the Book of Genesis, who is 
"walking in the garden toward the cool of the day." Not only is God portrayed as 



COD WALKS IN THE WORLD 41 


being on earth, and not in heaven, but God is said to be walking. This suggests that 
God has legs, which implies that God has some kind of human form. The added detail 
of "walking toward the cool of day" adds an additional humanizing element, as if 
God needed to cool off. After this, God ascends to heaven and remains there, except to 
descend to Mount Sinai to dictate the Torah to Moses.

58. GOD'S LANTERN 

When God took Israel out of Egypt, He took the lantern and went before them, as it is 
said, Yahweh went before them (Exod. 13:21). God escorted his descendants forty years in 
the wilderness. He was like a father holding a torch for his son, or like a master holding 
a torch for his servant. In this way God showed the nations of the world how dear the 
children were to Him, in that He Himself went before them so that the nations should 
treat them with respect. 


In Exodus God Himself leads the children of Israel: Yahweh went before them in a 
pillar of cloud by day , to guide them along the way , and in a pillar of fire by night , to give them 
light (Exod. 13:21). In this passage from Exodus Kabbah , however, God guides them by 
holding a lantern and going before them. Even though the biblical verse from Exodus 
is quite anthropomorphic, the image of God holding a lantern is far more so, in that 
God's presence can be hidden in a pillar of cloud or in a pillar of fire, but not when 
holding a lantern. Indeed, the suggested image is of a giant figure bearing a lantern 
who is leading the people. Rashi's comment on this verse confirms God's presence: 

"God Himself, in His glory, led the cloud before them." However, this verse also lends 
itself to a metaphorical interpretation, where the image of God guiding the people 
with a lantern can also be understood to mean that God illumined their path. But this 
allegorical reading cannot diminish the powerful anthropomorphic image of God car- 
rying a lantern and striding before the people through the wilderness.

59. GOD DESCENDS TO MOUNT SINAI 

On the third day, as morning dawned, there was thunder, and lightning, and a dense 
cloud upon the mountain, and a very loud blast of the horn; and all the people who were 
in the camp trembled. Moses led the people out of the camp toward God, and they took 
their places at the foot of the mountain. 

Now Mount Sinai was all in smoke, for the Lord had come down upon it in fire; the 
smoke rose like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain trembled violently. The 
blare of the horn grew louder and louder. As Moses spoke, God answered him in thun- 
der. The Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain, and the Lord 
called Moses to the top of the mountain and Moses went up. 

All the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the blare of the horn and the 
mountain smoking; and when the people saw it, they fell back and stood at a distance. 
"You speak to us," they said to Moses, "and we will obey; but let not God speak to us, lest 
we die." Moses answered the people, "Be not afraid; for God has come only in order to 



42 MYTHS OF COD 


test you, and in order that the fear of Him may be ever with you, so that you do not go 
astray." So the people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick cloud 
where God was. 

This is one of the most vivid manifestations of God found in the Bible, where God 
descends to the top of Mount Sinai. Further, all of Israel is present at this time as 
witnesses of God's existence. God's overwhelming presence also underscores the im- 
portance of the transmission of the Torah. All in all, it is a key moment of bonding 
between God and Israel, confirmed by God's explicit presence. 

How did God bridge the gap between heaven and earth? Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, 
ba-Hodesh 4:45-52, states that "God bent down the heavens and lowered them to the 
top of the mountain, and thus the Glory descended."

60. THE TENT OF MEETING 

Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it outside the camp, far off from the camp; 
and he called it the Tent of Meeting. And it came to pass, that every one who sought the 
Lord went out to the Tent of Meeting, which was without the camp. And it came to pass, 
when Moses went out to the tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, every man at his 
tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tent. 

And it came to pass, when Moses entered into the tent, the pillar of cloud descended, 
and stood at the door of the tent; and the Lord spoke with Moses. And when all the 
people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the tent, all the people rose up and 
worshipped, every man at his tent door. And the Lord spoke to Moses face to face, as a 
man speaks to his friend. . . 

Then it happened that the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of the Lord 
filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting, because 
the cloud abided within it, and God's glory filled the tabernacle. 

And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel 
went onward with their journeys. But if the cloud was not taken up, then they waited 
until the day came when it was. For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by 
day, and there was fire within it at night, in the sight of all of the House of Israel, through- 
out all their journeys. 

Here God descends to fill the Tent of Meeting and Moses is unable to enter it. This 
image establishes that God's presence takes up space. The key passage is: And Moses 
was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud abided within it, and God's 
glory filled the tabernacle. This passage, with its direct statement that God's presence 
had a physical manifestation, must be counted as one of the most vividly mythic epi- 
sodes in the Bible. 

The principle that God's presence takes space was drawn upon in the sixteenth cen- 
tury as the basis of Isaac Luria's kabbalistic theory of tzimtzum, which assumes that 
prior to Creation, God's presence filled the universe, and there was no room for any- 
thing else. So, in order to make space for the world to exist, Luria posited the contrac- 
tion of God prior to the creation of the world. See "The Contraction of God," p. 13. 

In Midrash Tanhuma, Shoftim 8 it is said that Moses would enter the Tent of Meeting 
and stand there, and the voice of God would descend from the heavens as a type of 
pillar of flame between the cherubim, and Moses heard the voice speaking to him as if 
it were within himself.

Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 1:1 comments on God's reducing His size as follows: "Thus 
did God surrender to His people Israel, for their sake shrinking His presence in order 
to dwell among them in the Tabernacle. Nevertheless, though God dwells in the Tab- 
ernacle, He does not confine His Presence to it. He is present everywhere, even in the 
lowliest thorn bush. He comes and goes as He pleases. His power is endless."

61. THE COTTAGE OF CANDLES 

There once was a Jew who went out into the world to seek justice. Somewhere, he was 
certain, true justice must exist, but he had never found it. So he set out on a quest that 
lasted for many years. He went from town to town and village to village, and every- 
where he went, he searched for justice, but never did he find it. 

In this way many years passed, until the man had explored all of the known world 
except for one last, great forest. He entered that dark forest without hesitation, for by 
now he was fearless, and he went everywhere in it. He went into the caves of thieves, but 
they mocked him and said, "Do you expect to find justice here?" And he went into the 
huts of witches, where they were stirring their brews, but they laughed at him and said, 
"Do you expect to find justice here?" 

The man went deeper and deeper into that forest, until at last he arrived at a little clay 
hut. Through the window he saw many flickering flames, and he was curious about 
them. So he went to the door and knocked. No answer. He knocked again. Nothing. At 
last he pushed the door open and stepped inside. 

Now, as soon as he stepped inside that cottage, the man realized that it was much 
larger on the inside than it had seemed to be from the outside. It was filled with hun- 
dreds of shelves, and on every shelf there were dozens of oil candles. Some of those 
candles were in precious holders of gold or silver or marble, and some were in cheap 
holders of clay or tin. And some of the holders were filled with oil and the flames burned 
brightly, while others had very little oil left. 

All at once an old man, with a long, white beard, wearing a white robe, appeared 
before him. " Shalom aleikhem , my son" the old man said. "How can I help you?" The man 
replied, " Aleikhem shalom. I have gone everywhere searching for justice, but never have I 
seen anything like this. Tell me, what are all these candles?" 

The old man said, "Each of these candles is the candle of a person's soul. As long as the 
candle continues to burn that person remains alive. But when the candle bums out that 
person's soul takes leave of this world." 

The man asked, "Can you show me the candle of my soul?" 

"Follow me," the old man said, and he led him through that long labyrinth of a cot- 
tage, which the man now saw must be endless. At last they reached a low shelf, and there 
the old man pointed to a candle in a holder of clay and said, "That is the candle of your 
soul." 

Now the man took one look at that flickering candle, and a great fear fell upon him, for 
the wick of that candle was very short, and there was very little oil left, and it looked as 
if at any moment the wick would slide into the oil and sputter out. He began to tremble. 
Could the end could be so near without his knowing it? Then he noticed the candle next 
to his own, also in a clay holder, but that one was full of oil, and its wick was long and 
straight and its flame burned brightly. "And whose candle is that?" the man asked. 

"I can only reveal each man's candle to himself alone," the old man said, and he turned 
and left. 



44 MYTHS OF COD 


The man stood there, quaking. All at once he heard a sputtering sound, and when he 
looked up, he saw smoke rising from another shelf, and he knew that somewhere, some- 
one was no longer among the living. He looked back at his own candle and saw that 
there were only a few drops of oil left. Then he looked again at the candle next to his own, 
so full of oil, and a terrible thought entered his mind. 

He stepped back and searched for the old man in every corner of the cottage, but he 
didn't see him anywhere. Then he picked up the candle next to his own and lifted it up 
above his own. At that instant the old man appeared out of nowhere and gripped his arm 
with a grip like iron. And the old man said: "Is this the kind of justice you are seeking?" 

The man closed his eyes because it hurt so much. And when he opened his eyes, he 
saw that the old man was gone, and the cottage and the candles had all disappeared. And 
he found himself standing alone in the forest and he heard the trees whispering his fate. 
And he wondered, had his candle burned out? Was he, too, no longer among the living? 

This story is a folk example of a divine test. The identity of the old man who tends 
the soul-candles and conducts the test remains a mystery, although his supernatural 
aspect is quite clear. As the Keeper of the Soul-Candles, he functions as an Elijah-type 
figure or perhaps as one of the Lamed-vav Tzaddikim, the Thirty-Six Hidden Saints, 
who are said to be the pillars of the world and are often described as living in the 
forest. See "The Thirty-Six Just Men," p. 397. It is also possible to view the old man as 
the Angel of Death, who has come to take the man's soul. Or the old man might even 
be identified as God, who has descended to this world to administer the test Himself. 

In any case, the test surely takes place at the behest of God, so it remains a divine one, 
similar to the divine tests found in Bible, such as those given to Adam and Eve con- 
cerning the forbidden fruit (Gen. 3), the Binding of Isaac (Gen. 22), and the trials of 
Job. Adam and Eve fail the divine test when they eat the forbidden fruit, but Abraham 
and Job pass the tests given them. Abraham demonstrates his willingness to sacrifice 
Isaac, and Job retains his faith in God despite a series of tragic events. 

The man in this story, who is never named, is clearly attempting to fulfill the bibli- 
cal injunction. Justice, justice, shall you pursue (Deut. 16:20). One way of reading the tale 
is to see that in arriving at this cottage, the man is on the verge of completing his 
lifelong quest to find justice, but he is first tested to see if he himself is truly just. It is 
interesting to note that his quest in this tale is in many ways parallel to that of the man 
from the country in Kafka s famous parable, "Before the Law," from The Trial, who 
comes seeking justice at the gates of the Law. See "Before the Law," p. 179. 

In this folktale the man who seeks justice sins when he attempts to steal oil from 
the soul-candle next to his own. But there are other Jewish tales in which the reverse is 
true. See, for example, "The Enchanted Inn" in Gabriel's Palace, where a boy finds a 
candle about to bum out and pours additional oil into it as a good deed, only to dis- 
cover later that it was the candle of his soul. Another variant, IFA 8335, tells of a cave 
in which there are bottles of oil, where a person lives until the oil is exhausted. Nor is 
the motif of soul-candles limited to Jewish folklore. Variants are found in Latin Ameri- 
can folklore, as well as in Spanish tales, among others. 

There is an implicit parallel between the soul-candles, which bum as long as a 
person lives, and the Jewish custom of lighting yahrzeit candles on the anniversary of 
a person's death. These memorial candles are intended to last for twenty-four hours, 
and remain lit until they bum out. The lighting of the yahrzeit candle is done to sym- 
bolize the verse. The soul of man is the lamp of God (Prov. 20:27), and this same verse is 
strongly echoed in this folktale. Note how the two verses from Deuteronomy and 
Proverbs serve as the foundation of this story. Justice, justice shall you pursue sets in 
motion the quest that propels the story, and The soul of man is the candle of God is the 
focus of the climactic episode about the cottage of candles. The quest is one of the 
most popular types of Jewish (and universal) folktales, especially fairy tales, but here 



EARLY INCARNATIONS OF THE SHEKHINAH 45 


the quest is not a conventional one for a lost princess, the sword of Moses, or a golden 
bird, but for an abstraction — justice. The fact that this story comes from Afghanistan 
seems entirely appropriate, for that is a harsh land where justice is very hard to find. 

One way of reading this tale is to see that in arriving at the cottage, the man is on 
the verge of completing his quest to find justice, but he is first tested to see if he him- 
self is just. Instead of proving worthy, he attempts to lengthen his life by depriving 
another of the years of life allotted to him. But he is caught and made to face the 
consequences of his action. In this sense he finds justice, for justice is exactly meted 
out. His error was to continually seek justice out in the world, but never to search for 
it within himself.

62 . THE CREATION OF WISDOM 

Wisdom was the first of God's creations. Older than the universe. Wisdom was created 
two thousand years before the creation of the world. She came forth in the beginning 
from the mouth of God, and will exis t for all eternity. Some say that God is the father of 
Wisdom, and she is God's ever- virgin daughter, whose true nature is intact and unde- 
filed. Others identify Wisdom as the daughter of God and the firstborn mother of all 
things. Still others say that God is the husband of Wisdom, who lives with God, for God 
loves her. 

Wisdom was present at the Creation of heaven and earth, as it is said, I was there when 
He set the heavens into place and when He fixed the foundations of the earth (Prov. 8:27-29). 
Some say that Wisdom was an observer in Creation, while others say that God created 
the world using Wisdom as the instrument of His workmanship, as it is said, Yahweh 
foun ded the ear th b^wisdomJProv. 3d9). 

^^Some^say that Wisdom's throne is in a pillar of cloud. Others say that Wisdom made 
the circuit of the vault of heaven alone, and walked in the depths of the abyss, but she 
could not find a place in which to dwell. Everywhere she went, in the waves of the sea, in 
the whole earth, she sought a resting place, a place to build her house. Some say that a 
place was foun d for her in the h eavens and she settled among the angel s, while others 
say that that God assigned a place for her tent in this world, and she made her dwelling 
in Jacob, and received her inheritance in Israel. So too did Wisdom send seven prophets 
to help mankind, from Moses to Ezra. 

Now Wisdom's house is a calm and serene haven, as it is said. Wisdom has built her 
Jwusej^ixiv^iy. No sooner do you call to Wisdom than she stands ready to serve you at 
your gates. No sooner do you chant words of Torah than she stands at your door. 

There is some debate over the identity of the mysterious figure of Wisdom ( Hokhmah 
in Hebrew, Sophia in Greek) described in Proverbs 8:22-3 1: 

The Lord created me at the beginning of His course, as the first of His works of old. In 
the distant past I was fashioned, at the beginning, at the origin of earth. There was still no 
deep when I was brought forth, no springs rich in water; before the foundation of the 
mountains were sunk, before the hills I was bom. He had not yet made earth and fields, 
or the world's first clumps of clay. I was there when He set the heavens into place; when 
He fixed the horizon upon the deep; when He made the heavens above firm, and the 
fountains of the deep gushed forth. When He assigned the sea its limits, so that its waters 
never transgress His command; when He fixed the foundations of the earth, I was with 
Him as a confidant, a source of delight every day, rejoicing before Him at all times, rejoic- 
ing in His inhabited world, finding delight with mankind. 



46 MYTHS OF COD 


Based on this description, the personification of Wisdom in Proverbs certainly seems 
to represent a mythic figure. Wisdom appears earlier in by wisdom 

founded the earth; by understanding He established the JzeaSeibrTeTermah 10:12 speaks of 
God having established the world with wisdom: He has made the earth by His power, has 
established the world by His wisdom, as doe^EsalmalQ424: How manifold are Your works, 
O Lord! With wisdom have You made them all. One kabbalistic interpretation of the first 
verse of Genesis ( bereshit bara elohim et ha-shamayim ve et ha-aretz) interprets the first 
words as "With the beginning" instead of "In the beginning," since bereshit can be 
understood both ways. Reshit, "the beginning," is then identified with Wisdom, since 
Proverbs 8:22 states that "God created me at the beginning." 

Drawing on his allegorical method, Philo identifies God as the "father" of all that was 
created, and Wisdom as the "mother," i.e., the knowledge with which God had inter- 
course, though not in the manner of humans, to engender all that was created (De Ebrietate 
30). This is a good example of how Philo's allegories straddle allegory and myth. 

Some view Wisdom as an early personification of God's feminine aspect, the 
Shekhinah. Wisdom also resembles the Gnostic concept of the Anima Mundi, the "world 
soul." Indeed, the most extensive development of Wisdom as a mythic figure is found 
in Gnostic literature. See, for example, Ptolemy's version of the Gnostic myth in Against 
Heresies by Irenaeus 1.1.1-1.8.5, which was the best-known account of Gnostic myth 
until the discovery of the Coptic manuscripts of Nag Hammadi. 

In some texts. Wisdom is given a more active role in Creation. In 3 Enoch 30:8, for 
example, on the sixth day of Creation God commanded Wisdom to create man out of 
the seven components: his flesh from earth, his blood from dew and from the sun, his 
eyes from the bottomless sea, his bones from stone, his reason from the speed of the 
angels, his veins and hair from the grass of the earth, his spirit from God's spirit and 
from the wind.

63. MOTHER ZION 

Mother Zion cries and laments over the children of Israel when they are in exile, and she 
waits for them to return to her bosom. 

When Jeremiah saw the smoke of the Temple in Jerusalem rising up, he broke down. 
And when he saw the stones that once were the walls of the Temple, he said: "What road 
have the exiles taken? I will go and perish with them." 

So Jeremiah accompanied them down the road covered with blood until they reached 
the river Euphrates. Then he thought to himself: "If I go on to Babylon, who will comfort 
those left in Jerusalem?" Therefore he took his leave of the exiles, and when they saw he 
was leaving, they wept, as it is said. By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat, sat and wept, as we 
thought of Zion (Ps. 137:1). 

As he was returning to Jerusalem, Jeremiah lifted his eyes and saw a woman seated at 
the top of a mountain, dressed in black, crying in distress, in great need of comfort. So too 



MYTHS OF THE BRIDE OF tiOD 47 


was Jeremiah in tears, wondering who would comfort him. He approached the woman, 
saying, "If you are a woman, speak, but if you are a spirit, depart at once!" She said: "Do 
you not recognize me? I am she who has borne seven sons, whose father went into exile 
in a distant city by the sea. Then a messenger brought the news that my husband, the 
father of my children, had been slain. And on the heels of that messenger came another 
with the news that my house had fallen in and slain my seven sons." 

Jeremiah said: "Do you deserve any more comfort than Mother Zion, who has been 
made into a pasture for the beasts?" And she replied: "I am Mother Zion, the mother of 
seven, as it is said. She who bore seven is forlorn , utterly disconsolate " (Jer. 15:9). 

This myth grows out of the verse She who bore seven is forlorn , utterly disconsolate 
(Jer. 15:9). It also is linked to Isaiah 66:8: For as soon as Zion travailed , she brought forth 
her children . The "she" is identified with the Land of Israel, giving birth to the figure of 
Mother Zion, a personification of Zion. Mother Zion cries and laments over the chil- 
dren of Israel when they are in exile, and she waits for them to return to her bosom. 

There is also an important passage in 2 Kings 19:21-28 concerning "Fair Maiden Zion," 
another feminine personification of Zion. This is also understood to be the feminine 
personification of Jerusalem: Fair Maiden Zion despises you , she mocks at you; Fair Jerusa- 
lem shakes her head at you. Other passages in Isaiah personify Jerusalem's grief in ways 
identical to that of Mother Zion: Her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate 
shall sit upon the ground (Isa. 3:26). 

At the same time. Mother Zion is an early incarnation of the Shekhinah, who is the 
mother of Israel, and whose home was the Temple in Jerusalem. Thus the link be- 
tween Mother Zion and the Shekhinah is a natural one, and Mother Zion may be viewed 
as one of the personas of the Shekhinah , as distinct as Her identity as the Bride of God. 

Still, the figure of Mother Zion must be seen as a strong remnant of goddess worship 
in Judaism, where Mother Zion is the goddess of Zion. The concept of Zion itself 
attributes a sacred quality to the Land of Israel, transforming it into the Holy Land, 
and making a personification such as Mother Zion possible. 

An earlier version of this vision of a mourning woman, much like that in Pesikta 
Rabbati, is found in IV Ezra 9:38-10:24, dating from around the first century. Thus a 
strong case can be made that there is a direct chain of tradition from Jeremiah 15:9 to 
IV Ezra to Pesikta Rabbati, an early medieval midrash. A subsequent version of this 
story, dating from the sixteenth century, concerns a vision of Rabbi Abraham Berukhim.

64. THE CREATION OF THE SHEKHINAH 

God's heavenly treasures were hidden in the innermost of many chambers. They could 
not be revealed to anyone, for they were too well hidden. 

So God decided to bring together His heavenly treasures in his daughter, the Shekhinah. 
That way he would make them available to the world, but only to those who knew where 
they could be found. 

So God saw to it that His daughter, the Shekhinah , contained within Herself all the 
paths of wisdom. Whoever knows those paths has access to God, and to all heavenly 



48 MYTHS OF COD 


wisdom. And whoever would like to fathom those paths must turn to Her for help, for 
only She knows where God has hidden His heavenly treasures. 

This myth is presented in the form of a parable in Sefer ha-Bahir, where God is 
identified as a king, as is standard in rabbinic parables about God. His daughter is the 
Shekhinah. Despite the allegorical format, the myth being conveyed is quite appar- 
ent— it is the myth of the divine pair, but here the male and female are both somehow 
contained within the same mythic figure. Thus God contains both the male and the 
female elements, even though they may appear to act independently of each other. 

Here monotheism reclaims the wholeness of God no matter how many aspects of God 
are portrayed. From this perspective, dualism itself becomes a form of monotheism. 

This paradox makes it possible to define a divinity capable of changing His mind, 
who could have masculine and feminine aspects and still be considered a single di- 
vine being. 

The concept that God has masculine and feminine aspects is explicitly stated in 
Zohar 3:290a: "As the Ancient One, whose name be blessed, took on a form. He shaped 
everything in male and female form. In another form things could not exist. Therefore 
the first beginning of development was at once male and female, with Hokhmah as 
father and Binah as mother." And the Zohar restates the Bahir's identification of the 
Shekhinah as mother, daughter, and sister: "She (Malkhut— the sefirah representing the 
Shekhinah) is sometimes called daughter and sometimes sister, and here She is called 
mother. And in fact She is all these" ( Zohar 2:100b). 

What are the heavenly treasures in the parable? They are the secrets of Creation 
and other heavenly mysteries. God is not going to reveal these to everyone, but only 
to the initiated. These secrets were all used to create God's daughter, representing 
God's feminine aspect, known as the Shekhinah. Thus all the mysteries of God are 
focused in this single figure. 

The parable in Sefer ha-Bahir also states that God hid His treasures not only in the 
Shekhinah , but in Her garments as well. These garments can be identified as the Oral 
Torah, or even as the Torah itself. This suggests that the Torah is the means by which 
God reveals His secrets of Creation.

65. GOD'S NAMES FOR THE SHEKHINAH 

Because of His love for the Shekhinah, God sometimes calls Her "My sister," since they are 
both from the same place. Sometimes He calls Her "My daughter," since She is truly His 
daughter. And sometimes He calls Her "My Mother." 

When Abraham said of Sarah, "She is my sister" (Gen. 20:2), he was speaking about the 
Shekhinah, who was constantly with Sarah. Indeed, when Abraham saw the Shekhinah in 
the abode of Sarah, he was emboldened to declare, "She is my sister." For in so speaking, 
Abraham was making a mystical allusion, for the Shekhinah is the daughter of Supernal 



MYTHS OF THE BRIDE OF &lt;aOD 49 


Wisdom, and in calling her his sister, Abraham was following the admonition. Say unto 
Wisdom , you are my sister (Prov. 7:4). 

The Shekhinah represents the feminine aspect of God. In this passage from the Sefer 
ha-Bahir, the point is made that all representations of the feminine are included. For 
just as humans have daughters, sisters, brides, and mothers, so the divine feminine 
figure has all of these characteristics as well. 

Abraham's identification of Sarah as his sister is interpreted in the Zohar as a refer- 
ence not to Sarah, but to the Shekhinah . The Zohar states that Abraham used the term in 
a mystic sense, as in the verse my sister , my love , my dove , my undefiled (S. of S. 5:2). The 
Zohar also identifies the Shekhinah with the figure of Wisdom, linking " She is my sister " 
with the verse. Say unto wisdom , You are my sister (Prov. 7:4).

66. THE TWO SHEKHINAHS 

God's daughter, the Shekhinah , exists in two realms at the same time. There is a Shekhinah 
above, just as there is a Shekhinah below. 

In Her divine manifestation. She stays in heaven, as it is said. All of the glory of the king's 
daughter is within Her (Ps. 45:14). There she guards the secrets of the Written Torah. 

But in her earthly manifestation she comes down to earth from a faraway land, from 
the side of light, and she reveals the secrets of the Oral Torah. For She is God's messenger, 
and the world is illuminated through Her deeds, for her deeds give light to the world. 

So that they can always communicate, God has built a window between them, and 
whenever She needs Her Father, or He needs Her, they join one another through the 
window. In this way God Himself enters the world in the form of His daughter. 

This parable in Sefer ha-Bahir presents the relationship between the feminine ele- 
ments of the sefirot in mythic terms. The two Shekhinahs, also known as the Two Moth- 
ers, refer to the third sefirah, Binah, the symbol of the mother, and the tenth sefirah, 
Malkhut , which represents the Shekhinah. Thus Binah stands for the upper feminine, 
the heavenly Shekhinah , and Malkhut stands for the earthly feminine, whose home is in 
the Temple in Jerusalem. The importance of this myth is to demonstrate that a divine 
feminine presence can be found above and below. The role of the heavenly Shekhinah 
derives from the position of the third sefirah , Binah , where the Shekhinah represents 
God's glory, and she is united with God in the innermost chamber of the king. At the 
same time, the earthly Shekhinah is linked to the tenth sefirah, Malkhut, where the 
Shekhinah is in a position to exert her influence on the lives of human beings. 

Another way of reading this myth is to see it as referring to the two Torahs, the 
Written Torah and the Oral Torah. Sefer ha-Bahir makes an explicit reference to this 
tradition in identifying the Shekhinah as a princess, coming from "a faraway land, 
from the side of light," which would seem to be a reference to heaven. In this kabbalistic 
myth, the heavenly manifestation of the Shekhinah is linked to the Written Torah, and 
Her earthly manifestation is linked to the Oral Torah. While the accepted rabbinic 
tradition is that God revealed both the Written and the Oral Torah at Mount Sinai, 

Sefer ha-Bahir seems to be suggesting that the Written Torah remains in heaven, while 
the Oral Torah has been revealed on earth. See "The Betrothal of the Torah," p. 256. 



50 MYTHS OF &lt;iOD 


Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav's famous first story, "The Lost Princess," from Sippurei 
Ma asiyot, also concerns a princess, and, as is almost always the case, the king repre- 
sents God, while the princess represents the Shekhinah, the feminine aspect of God. In 
"The Lost Princess," Rabbi Nachman describes this princess as having vanished mys- 
teriously, somehow lost to the Other Side. The quest to return the lost princess from 
Her exile turns out to be an arduous one, which remains unfinished at the end of 
Rabbi Nachman's story.

67. THE EARTHLY DWELLING OF THE SHEKHINAH 

From the beginning of the world's Creation, the Shekhinah dwelt in this lower world. Her 
original abode was in the Garden of Eden, residing on a cherub under the Tree of Life. 
Indeed, the primal root of the Shekhinah was planted there. Bands of angels descended 
from heaven to serve the will of the Shekhinah in all ways. When God went in and out of 
the Garden, everyone in the world gazed upon the splendor of the Shekhinah, which radi- 
ated from one end of the world to the other, far more brilliant than the sun. 

When Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden, they dwelt at the Gates of the Garden 
to gaze upon the radiant appearance of the Shekhinah. In the presence of the Shekhinah 
they experienced no illness nor suffered any pain. No demons could obtain power over 
them, nor could they injure them. 

Some say that the Shekhinah remained on earth until Adam sinned, and then was re- 
moved to the first heaven. Others say that as soon as Adam broke the commandment, the 
Shekhinah fled on Her own from the Garden of Eden. Still others say that the Shekhinah 
remained on earth until the rise of idolatry in the generation of Enosh. Using magic taught 
to them by the fallen angel Azazel, that wicked generation brought down the sun, the 
moon and the stars and stationed them before their idols, to serve them. 

Then the angels brought a complaint before God, and God immediately removed the 
Shekhinah from their midst. And as the Shekhinah ascended on high, the angels surrounded 
Her with psalms and songs and by the sound of the shofar and trumpets, as it is said, God 
went up with a fanfare of trumpets (Ps. 47:6). Indeed, some say that in this way the angels 
themselves succeeded in raising up the Shekhinah on high. The glory of the Shekhinah rose 
from the heavenly firmament to the chambers of the palace, from the chambers of the 
palace to the palace of majesty, from the palace of majesty to the fiery citadel, from the 
fiery citadel to the flaming castle, from the flaming castle to the ranks of the angels, from 
the ranks of the angels to the wheels of the chariot, from the wheels of the chariot to the 
Throne of Glory. 

Then the heavens rejoiced, clothed in joyful garments and wrapped in glory. The sun 
and the moon and all the stars danced before the Throne of Glory and before God. But 
while the heavens celebrated, the Prince of the World and all the orders of creation put on 
mourning and clothed themselves with grief and sighing, as it is said. Therefore the land 
will mourn (Hos. 4:3). 



MYTHS OF THE BRIDE OF COD 51 


Still others say that the Shekhinah departed from earth after the sin of Adam, but re- 
turned when the Ark of the Tabernacle was constructed, and made Her home there. Later, 
She took up residence in the Holy of Holies of the Temple in Jerusalem and remained 
there until the Temple was destroyed. Some say that the Shekhinah returned to heaven 
after that, while others say that She went into exile with her children, Israel, but she still 
returns from time to time to visit the Kotel, the last remaining wall of the Temple, that 
once was Her home. 

Then there are those who insist that the Shekhinah never dwelt in the lower world from 
the time of the Creation until the Tabernacle was erected. But from that time forward she 
did dwell there. 

The Shekhinah represents God's immanence in this world. In rabbinic literature the 
term Shekhinah is used primarily as a synonym for God, or for God's presence in the 
world. But in the kabbalistic texts the role of the Shekhinah takes on a mythic indepen- 
dence. For by the very act of presenting the Shekhinah as dwelling on earth while God 
dwells in heaven, some kind of mythic separation is suggested. 

This myth almost certainly derives from the verse They heard the sound of the Lord God 
moving about in the garden (Gen. 3:8). In Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 1:1, this verse is said to 
prove God's presence on earth at the beginning of time. This text also asserts, "At the 
beginning of time, the root of the Shekhinah was fixed in the regions of the earth below." 
Numbers Rabbah 13:6 states, "From the very first day on which God created the world, 

God was eager to dwell with His creatures in the terrestrial regions." Why did God 
want to dwell on earth rather than in heaven? The text goes on to explain that "because 
God was alone in His world, He yearned to dwell with his creatures in the terrestrial 
regions." Thus this myth of the earthly dwelling of the Shekhinah presumes a terrestrial, 
rather than a celestial, home for the Shekhinah , who is God's Bride. That is why the 
Shekhinah is known as the Divine Presence, thus the presence of God in this world. 

In some versions of this myth, the earthly home of the Shekhinah is said to have 
existed from the creation of the world, with the Shekhinah dwelling in the Garden of 
Eden; in other versions, the descent of the Shekhinah did not take place until the Taber- 
nacle was erected and God caused the Shekhinah to dwell within it, and later in the 
Holy of Holies in the Temple in Jerusalem. 

Other versions of this myth, such as that found in Avot de-Rabbi Natan 34:8 and 
alluded to in Zohar 1:75a, suggest that God descended to earth in ten descents: one 
into the Garden of Eden, one in the generation of the Tower of Babel, one in Sodom, 
one in Egypt, one at the sea, one at Mount Sinai, one in the pillar of cloud, one in the 
Temple, and one that is destined to take place at the time of the messianic era. Each of 
these descents is explained by an appropriate prooftext, such as. They heard the sound 
of the Lord God moving about in the Garden (Gen. 3:8) or, Yahweh came down to look at the 
city and tower (Gen. 11:5). Here, however, the use of the term Shekhinah seems to refer 
primarily to God's visits to this world. 

Between the time of dwelling in the Garden and that of the Tabernacle, however, 

God removed the Shekhinah from the world in seven stages, as a result of the sins of 
subsequent generations. Thus the Shekhinah withdrew to the first heaven when Adam 
sinned, and withdrew further from this world following the sin of Cain, the generation 
of Enosh, the generation of the Flood, that of the Dispersion, that of the Sodomites, and 
that of the Egyptians in the days of Abraham. These phases are known as "the Removal 
of the Shekhinah." Accounts of the removal of the Shekhinah are found in Numbers Rabbah , 

Avot de-Rabbi Natan, 3 Enoch, Midrash Aleph Bet, and Gevurot ha-Shem 66. 

In Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 1:1, a process of return is also described. Thus, when 
Abraham arose, the Shekhinah came back from the seventh heaven to the sixth; like- 
wise, the merits of Isaac, Jacob, Levi, Kehat, Amram, and Moses each brought the 
Shekhinah closer to earth. So the erection of the Tabernacle was the final stage in a 
process of return that had begun in the time of Abraham. 

Midrash Aleph Bet proposes that the songs and music made by the angels raised up 
the Shekhinah from the Garden of Eden to the upper worlds.

68. THE ROAMING OF THE SHEKHINAH 

The plan of Creation was to mirror the upper and lower worlds. Therefore, at the begin- 
ning of Creation, the Shekhinah dwelt in the lower world. At first, the worlds above and 
below drew on each other, and the links between them were perfect, drawing from above 
to below, and from below to above. 

But because the Shekhinah dwelt below, the heavens and the earth became fragmented. 
Then Adam sinned, ruining the channels linking the worlds, and Creation became un- 
raveled. The Shekhinah completely fled from this world. 

It was Abraham who drew the Shekhinah back from the world above. His body served 
as a seat for the Shekhinah, who would sit on his back, as it is said, God arose above Abraham 
(Gen. 17:22). So did Isaac and Jacob serve as the throne of God's Chariot. Still, the Shekhinah 
was without a home. During the day She would fly through the air, carried on the backs 
of the Forefathers, but She never found the peace She knew at the beginning of Creation. 

Then Moses and the children of Israel came and built the Tabernacle and its sacred 
vessels. They repaired the broken channels, until living water flowed again. Then the 
Shekhinah returned to dwell in the lower spheres. But now She dwelt in the Tent of Meet- 
hig, and not on the ground, as at the beginning of Creation. That is the meaning of the 
verse And let them make Me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them (Exod. 25:8). 

So it was that wherever Israel wandered, the Shekhinah dwelt among them, roaming 
from place to place. This distressed David, and he yearned to find a permanent place for 
the Shekhinah to dwell. God sent a message to David through Nathan the Prophet: Thus 
says the Lord: Are you the one to build a house for Me to dwell in? From the day I brought my 
people out of the land of Egypt to this day I have not dwelt in a house, but have moved about in tent 
and Tabernacle" (2 Sam. 7:5-6). 

So David designed the form of the Temple to create a throne and dwelling place for the 
Shekhinah. Solomon came after that and built the Temple, and the Shekhinah descended to 
Her eternal home and once more dwelt in the land. Once again the channels between 
heaven and earth were open, and in this way the Shekhinah drew abundant blessings 
down on Jerusalem and on all of the Holy Land. She will never move from this holy 
place, as it is said. This is My resting-place for all time (Ps. 132:14). 

This kabbalistic version of the earthly descent of the Shekhinah comes from Sha’arei 
Orah, a thirteenth century kabbalistic text by Yosef Gikatilla. Here can be found the 
fully developed kabbalistic reworking of the myth of the Shekhinah. At the same time, 
there are some unique aspects of Gikatilla's version of the myth that almost seem to 
anticipate Lurianic kabbalah in the sixteenth century. 

The primary quest of the myth is to find a home for the Shekhinah. At the beginning 
of Creation, the Shekhinah makes Her home on earth, to balance God's dwelling on 
high. The balance between above and below makes contact between them possible. 

This is described as an ideal condition, yet some kind of flaw in the plan of Creation 



MYTHS OF THE BRIDE OF COD 53 


begins to emerge, an imbalance between above and below. This initial fragmentation 
is followed by Adam's sin, after which the Shekhinah departed from the lower world 
and returned on high. Only Abraham and the other patriarchs succeeded in drawing 
the Shekhinah back to this world. But the quest to find the Shekhinah a home does not 
end until Moses builds the Tabernacle and Solomon builds the Temple, the Shekhinah's 
true home on earth. Gikatilla 's myth states this directly: "At the time of Adam there 
was no fixed place for the Shekhinah. When Solomon built the Temple, there was a 
permanent place for the Shekhinah in Israel" (chap. 8). 

In both Gikatilla's version of the myth and in the myth of the Ari, blame for the 
fallen state of existence is not placed on Adam. Instead, it is strongly suggested that 
there was a flaw in the plan of the divinity. In Gikatilla's myth, there is the statement 
that "because the Shekhinah dwelt below, the heavens and the earth became frag- 
mented." This suggests there was an inherent flaw in the original plan for Creation, 
which was to mirror the upper and lower worlds. Somehow it became unbalanced, 
and the links between the worlds above and below began to break apart. 

This is precisely equal to the effect of the shattered vessels in the myth of Isaac Luria. 
Both are examples of cosmic catastrophes. In the Ari's creation myth, God sends forth 
vessels filled with light, which shatter, scattering sparks of light throughout the uni- 
verse. This is known as the Shattering of the Vessels. This myth, like Gikatilla's, seems 
to insist that there is some kind of flaw in the divinity. For Gikatilla, who preceded the 
Ari, the flaw was the original separation of God and the Shekhinah , with one dwelling 
above and the other below. Somehow this threw things out of balance, leading to the 
fragmentation of the links between the upper and lower worlds. Thus both texts sug- 
gest that the primary blame for the cosmic catastrophe that resulted in a fallen world 
was not the fault of man, but was inherent in God's plan of Creation. This is a daring 
theological position, since it also implies that God could be imperfect, for how could a 
perfect God create an imperfect plan? Thus it would appear that Luria had some 
kabbalistic precedent for his seminal myth. 

This is also a Merkavah myth. Usually the Shekhinah and the Merkavah do not ap- 
pear in the same myths, but this is an exception. Here we find the radical notion that 
the patriarchs are said to serve as God's Chariot, the Merkavah , which is described as a 
Throne and Chariot at the same time, hurtling through space. The myth is also inter- 
esting in presenting the Shekhinah as the rider in the Chariot, whereas most Merkavah 
imagery portrays God seated on His Throne of Glory. 

The strangest aspect of this Merkavah myth is the role of the patriarchs. How could 
the patriarchs either singly (as in Sha'arei Orah 8) or together ( Sha'arei Or ah 1) serve as 
God's Chariot? The idea seems best understood metaphorically — the patriarchs were 
able to bring down the Shekhinah and they served as a kind of spiritual foundation for 
God in this world. The Merkavah , representing both Throne and Chariot, thus symbol- 
izes such a foundation. It is possible to trace the development of this idea to the state- 
ment in the Talmud ( B . Shabbat 152b) that the souls of the righteous are hidden under 
the Throne of Glory. But in Zohar 1:113a (Midrash ha-Ne'elam) and other sources in the 
Zohar , the metaphor begins to take on a mythic life of its own. The Shekhinah is de- 
scribed as riding on the backs of the patriarchs. This in itself is a strange image, until 
we understand that here the patriarchs are literally being visualized as serving as a 
flying Throne and Chariot. The statement "The Patriarachs are the Merkavah" recurs 
in Genesis Rabbah 47:6, 69:3 and 82:6. 

This theme of the patriarchs serving as God's Chariot is also found in a dream of 
Hayim Vital's in Sefer ha-Hezyonot: "I dreamed that there was a book open before me 
and it was written there that the souls of the Tzaddikim are hewn out of the divine 
throne. After their deaths, they return there and are made the Chariot for the Shekhinah ."

69. THE GARMENTS OF THE SHEKHINAH 

The Shekhinah has many garments, consisting of holy angels from above and Israel from 
below. From these garments God created the Throne of Glory, as well as heaven and 
earth and all the creatures therein. 

The robe of the Shekhinah is made of light. The light of the first day is reflected from 
that robe. The Shekhinah wears that robe whenever Israel gives forth light through good 
deeds. But when Israel does evil. She is garbed in the black garments of Lilith, and She is 
forced to wear them until Israel repents. 

The Shekhinah is often described as a bride wearing a garment of light. This myth 
describes the Shekhinah as wearing garments of light whenever God is pleased with 
the good deeds of Israel, and black garments when Israel sins. Tikkunei ha-Zohar ex- 
plains that the Shekhinah puts on these harsh garments to protect Israel. Alternately, 
the harsh garments are identified as black garments belonging to Lilith, thereby put- 
ting the Shekhinah , the positive feminine aspect of God, under the power of the evil 
Lilith, who represents the dark feminine. Indeed, in the Zohar and other kabbalistic 
texts, Lilith and the Shekhinah are portrayed as feminine polar opposites. 

The robe of the Shekhinah is linked to the light of the first day of Creation. See "The 
Light of the First Day," p. 83.

70. THE SACRED BEDCHAMBER 

On the very day King Solomon completed the building of the Temple in Jerusalem, God 
and His Bride were united, and Her face shone with perfect joy. Then there was joy for 
all, above and below. 

As long as the Temple stood, it served as the sacred bedchamber of God the King and 
His Bride, the Shekhinah. Every midnight She would enter through the place of the Holy 
of Holies, and She and God would celebrate their joyous union. The loving embrace of 
the King and His Queen assured the well-being not only of Israel, but also of the whole 
world. 

The King would come to the Queen and lie in Her arms, and all that She asked of Him 
he would fulfill. He placed his left arm under Her head. His right arm embraced Her, and 
He let Her enjoy His strength. Their pleasure in each other was indescribable. He made 
His home with Her and took His delight between Her breasts. They lay in a tight em- 
brace, Her image impressed on His body like a seal imprinted upon a page, as it is writ- 
ten, Set me as a seal upon Your heart (S. of S. 8:6). 

As long as the Temple stood, the King would come down from his heavenly abode 
every midnight, seek out his Bride, and enjoy her in their sacred bedchamber. But when the 
Temple was destroyed, the Shekhinah went into exile, and Bride and Groom were tom apart. 

This explicit myth portrays the interaction of God and His Bride as a highly eroti- 
cized coupling, a sacred copulation ( zivvug ha-kodesh ). This is a primal image of the 
sacred marriage (hieros gamos). In Zohar 1:120b, this is referred to as "the one total 
coupling, the full coupling, as is proper." Zohar 3:296a expands on this: "The Matronita 
(the Shekhinah) united herself with the king. From this, one body resulted." This illus- 
trates the strong sexual dimension of kabbalistic thought, especially in the Zohar. It 
also demonstrates the direct correlation between the unity and union of God and His 
Bride and the existence of the Temple in Jerusalem. The destruction of the Temple 



MYTHS OF THE BRIDE OF COD 55 


brings about the separation of God and the Shekhinah and sends the Shekhinah into 
exile. All of this comes about because of the sins of Israel. When Israel sins, these sins 
give power to the forces of evil, preventing the Shekhinah from uniting with Her hus- 
band, and forcing the divine couple to turn away from each other. When Israel re- 
pents, God and the Shekhinah turn back to each other. 

So important is the coupling of God and the Shekhinah that in Zohar 3:296a, Rabbi 
Shimon bar Yohai, the principal figure in the Zohar, describes it as the deepest of all 
mysteries. 

According to B. Ta'anit 16a and Song of Songs Kabbah 1:66, one of the names for the 
place where the Temple was built was "the bedchamber."

71. THE CASTING DOWN OF THE SHEKHINAH 

Before God destroyed His house and the holy land below. He first cast His Bride from on 
high, bringing Her down from where she took nourishment from the sacred heavens. 
Only then did He destroy the Temple in the world below. For these are the ways of God 
when He wishes to judge the world: First He passes judgment on the world above, and 
then He establishes His justice in the world below. 

This myth is a variant of the myth of the exile of the Shekhinah, creating a link 
between the destruction of the Temple and the departure of the Shekhinah from Her 
heavenly home. It is shocking in its violence — God casts His Bride out of heaven, an 
exile parallel to that of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. One purpose of the 
myth is to demonstrate that God also suffered great losses at the time the Temple was 
destroyed. Here, furthermore, it is asserted that God's losses preceded those of the 
Temple. For only after God had cast out His Bride from on high did He permit the 
destruction of the Temple. See "The Exile of the Shekhinah ," p. 57. 

Like the Shekhinah, Lucifer was cast out of heaven. But while Lucifer led a rebellion 
against God, there is no evidence that the Shekhinah did anything wrong. Instead, her 
removal from heaven symbolizes the high price paid above as well as below.

72. THE WANDERING OF THE SHEKHINAH 

The sins of the Israelites caused the Shekhinah to go into exile. As the sins grew, the Shekhinah 
wandered away from them. She wandered from the cover of the Ark to one of the cher- 
ubs, from the first cherub to the second, from the second cherub to the threshold of the 
Temple, from the threshold to the court of the priests, from the court to the altar, from the 
altar to the roof of the Temple, from the roof to the wall, from the wall to the city of 
Jerusalem, from the city to the Mount of Olives, from the mount to the desert. 

During this time the Shekhinah hid Herself in exile like the moon behind a cloud and 
could not be seen. Even though Israel yearned to look at the light, it was impossible to see 
Her, because She was in darkness. That was a darkness so deep it is known as "the dark- 
ened light." 

Some say that the Shekhinah lingered in the wilderness for six months, waiting for 
Israel to repent. But when they did not. She proclaimed, "Let them perish!" Others say 
that the Shekhinah dwelt for three and a half years on the Mount of Olives, crying out 



56 MYTHS OF COD 


three times a day, " Turn back , O rebellious children !" (Jer. 3:22). When this proved to be 
futile, she said, "I will return to my abode" (Hos. 5:15), and She departed the city through 
the Gate of Mercy and ascended to heaven to await their repentance. And it is said that 
when She comes back. She will return through that same gate. 

This myth recounts ten stages of the wandering of the Shekhinah from the Temple 
to the desert. At each station she becomes more remote from the people of Israel, 
driven away by their sins. The Gate of Mercy through which the Shekhinah departs 
Jerusalem was said to have been built by King Solomon with stones brought him by 
the Queen of Sheba. It is said that after the time of the destruction of the Temple, this 
gate sank into the earth. But its restoration is expected at the time of the coming of the 
Messiah, for the children of Israel will return through that gate. 

This myth is parallel to that of the Removal of the Shekhinah , in which each major 
sin of Israel resulted in the Shekhinah moving further away from this world. See the 
commentary to "The Earthly Dwelling of the Shekhinah" for a discussion of it.

73. THE LAMENT OF THE SHEKHINAH 

Since the destruction of the Temple, the Shekhinah descends night after night to the place 
of the Temple, enters the Holy of Holies, and sees that Her dwelling-house and Her couch 
are ruined and soiled. And She wanders up and down, wails and laments, and weeps 
bitterly. She looks at the place of the cherubs and lifts up Her voice and says, "My couch, 
My couch. My dwelling-place, where My husband would come to Me and lie in My arms, 
and all that I asked of Him, He would give Me. My couch. My couch, do you not remem- 
ber how I came to you in joy and contentment, and how those youths, the cherubim, 
came forth to meet Me, beating their wings in welcome? How has the Ark of the Cov- 
enant which stood here come to be forgotten? From here went forth nourishment for all 
the world and light and blessing to all. Now I seek My husband in every place, but he is 
not here. My husband. My husband, where have You gone? Do You not remember how 
You held Your left arm beneath my head and Your right arm embraced me, and You 
vowed that You would never cease loving Me? And now You have forgotten Me." 

This myth offers a moving account of the Shekhinah as a spurned lover. It follows 
the explicit husband-wife imagery of "The Sacred Bedchamber," p. 54, which derives 
from the same source, Zohar Hadash.

74. THE WAILING OF THE SHEKHINAH 

Each person of Israel is a member of the Shekhinah. If any one of Israel abandons his faith 
for another, he is cutting himself off from the Shekhinah. Then the Shekhinah wails and 
says: "As long as the member is connected, there is some hope that it will recover, but 
when the member is cut off, no repair is possible." 

This teaching is attributed to the Ba'al Shem Tov. The people of Israel are consid- 
ered to be the members of the Shekhinah — each person functions like an arm or a leg. 

But when they are converted — as happened in the time of the Ba'al Shem Tov to the 



MYTHS OF THE BRIDE OF COD 57 


Frankists, who converted to Christianity — they not only cut themselves off from their 
people, but also from the Shekhinah. And like an arm or leg that has been amputated, 
there is no longer any hope of repair.

75. THE EXILE OF THE SHEKHINAH 

When the Temple was still standing, Israel would perform their rites, and bring offerings 
and sacrifices. And the Shekhinah rested upon them in the Temple, like a mother hovering 
over her children, and all faces were resplendent with light, so that there was blessing 
both above and below. 

When the Temple was destroyed, the Shekhinah came and went up to all those places 
where She used to dwell, and She would weep for Her home and for Israel, who had 
gone into exile, and for all the righteous and the pious ones who had perished. 

At that time the Holy One, blessed be He, questioned the Shekhinah , and said to her, 
"What ails you?" And She replied, weeping, "My children are in exile, and the Sanctuary 
has been burnt, so why should I remain here?" Now the Temple is destroyed and the 
Shekhinah is with Israel in exile and there is no joy to be found, above or below. 

The myth about the separation of God and His Bride is a primary example of the 
emergence of the Shekhinah as an independent mythical figure. The story also resembles 
the conflict between an angry couple, where the wife leaves the husband and accom- 
panies the children, here the children of Israel. 

From the perspective of the Zohar, the fact that the Shekhinah accompanied Israel is 
evidence of God's attachment to Israel: "All the time Israel was in exile, the Shekhinah 
was in exile with them. And since the Shekhinah was with them, God remembered 
them, to do good to them and bring them out of exile" ( Zohar 1:120b). 

The exile of the Shekhinah is presented in the form of a parable about a king in Sefer 
ha-Bahir, in which the king had a beautiful wife and children, but when the children 
turned to evil ways, the king became angry with the children and their mother. The 
mother then went to the children and upbraided them for their behavior and its con- 
sequences until they changed their ways and did the will of their father. Then the king 
remembered them and loved them as much as he did in the beginning, and also re- 
membered their mother. The king, of course, is God, and the king's wife the Shekhinah , 
while the children are the children of Israel. According to Rabbi Shlomo Rabinowitz 
of Radomsk, "The Shekhinah protects Jews like a mother taking care of her children" 
(Tiferet Shlomo on Deuteronomy 29:27). The myth of the exile of the Shekhinah found in 
the Zohar follows this earlier parable closely, and the earlier parable may well be the 
inspiration for it. It is interesting to note that in the parable from Sefer ha-Bahir , the 
queen is responsible for the well-being of her children, and the fate of the queen de- 
pends on the fate of her children. When the children repent and God loves them once 
again. He also remembers His love for their mother, the queen. 

According to the Zohar, the exile of the Shekhinah that took place at the time of the 
destruction of the Temple was not Her first exile, but Her second. The first took place 
when Adam sinned, and the Shekhinah went into disgrace and was dismissed from the 
celestial palace, going into exile. Thus a distinct parallel is drawn between the conse- 
quences of the sin of the forbidden fruit and the destruction of the Temple. Both are 
regarded as cosmic catastrophes. 

The weeping of the Shekhinah in this myth has parallels with the weeping of Rachel 
in Jeremiah 31:15, and with the weeping of Mother Zion in Jeremiah 15:9, 4 Ezra 9:38- 
10:24 (where there is a Mother Zion-type of figure) and in Pesikta Rabbati 26:7. Indeed, 

- it is likely that Mother Zion was a precursor figure to the medieval kabbalistic evolu- 
tion of the concept of the Shekhinah into the Bride of God. See "Mother Zion," p. 46.

The weeping of the Shekhinah is also central to the sixteenth century tale, "A Vision at 
the Wailing Wall." See this story, p. 63. 

The kind of conflict between God and the Shekhinah reflected in this myth resembles 
the marital disputes between Zeus and Hera in Greek mythology. See the Introduc- 
tion, p. lxv, for a discussion of the parallels between Zeus and Hera and God and the 
Shekhinah. See Graves, The Greek Myths, 13c, 13.1.

76. MOURNING OVER THE SHEKHINAH 

After the Temple had been destroyed and the Shekhinah had gone into exile, all the angels 
went into mourning for Her, and they composed dirges and lamentations for her. So too 
did all the upper and lower realms weep for Her and go into mourning. 

Then God came down from heaven and looked upon His house that had been burned. 
He looked for His people, who had gone into exile. And He inquired about His Bride, 
who had left Him. And just as she had suffered a change, so too did Her husband — His 
light no longer shone, and He was changed from what He had been. Indeed, by some 
accounts God was bound in chains. 

God said to the ministering angels, "When a mortal king mourns, what does he do?" 
They said, "He extinguishes his torches." God said "I too shall do that. The sun and moon 
will become black, and the stars stop shining" (Joel 4:15). 

God said, "When a mortal king mourns, what does he do?" They said, "He sits in 
silence." God said, "I too shall do that. I will sit alone and keep silent." 

God said, "When a mortal king mourns, what does he do?" They said, "He sits and 
laments." God said, "I too shall do that." 

Here God and the angels are shown in mourning over the exile of the Shekhinah. 

Even the heavens and the earth are said to mourn, as in the verse, "7 clothe the skies in 
blackness and make their raiment sackcloth" (Isa. 50:3). So too is the mourning of the an- 
gels confirmed with a prooftext: The angels of peace wept bitterly (Isa. 33:7). 

The most daring part of the myth is the suggestion that, having lost the Shekhinah, 

God's glory has somehow been reduced — "His light no longer shone, and He was 
changed from what He was before." What has been lost is the feminine aspect of God, 
and without it God is incomplete. This myth seems to contradict the general view that 
God is unchanging and eternal, and makes God dependent on His Bride in the same 
way that a husband is dependent on his wife. Indeed, God is here referred to as a 
"husband." In Zohar 1:182a God's diminishment is explained as follows: "The secret 
of the matter is that blessings reside only where male and female are together." 

The explanation in Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 13:9 that God was bound in chains, de- 
rives from God's promise that "7 will be with him in distress" (Ps. 91:15), so that when 
Jeremiah was bound in chains, so too was God.

77. THE SUFFERING OF THE SHEKHINAH 

Wherever Israel is exiled, the Shekhinah is exiled with them and suffers with them. Those 
who are in this bitter exile should not be concerned with their personal distress, but 
should only lament the exile of the Shekhinah. For through Torah study and prayer, one is 
able to repair the limbs of the Shekhinah that were shattered in exile. 



MYTHS OF THE BRIDE OF COO 59 


Here the exile and suffering of the Shekhinah are seen as a communal expression of 
the exile and suffering of Israel. Therefore, individuals "should not be concerned with 
their personal distress, but should only lament the exile of the Shekhinah ." A similar 
view was expressed by Rabbi Nathan of Nemirov (1780-1845), the scribe of Rabbi 
Nachman of Bratslav, in writing about the meaning of Rabbi Nachman's story "The 
Lost Princess" in Sippurei Ma'asiyot : "Everyone in Israel is occupied with the search 
for the lost princess, to take her back to her father, for Israel as a whole has the charac- 
ter of the minister who searches for her." See "The Shekhinah Within," p. 63. For more 
on the limbs of the Shekhinah see "The Wailing of the Shekhinah ," p. 56. 

Above all, this myth insists that the quest to end the exile of the Shekhinah is a 
communal one for all the people of Israel. And until that takes place, the suffering of 
the Shekhinah must be shared by all of Israel. Rabbi Dov Ber offers a different perspec- 
tive on the concept that all Jewish souls are the limbs of the Shekhinah , identifying 
each Jewish soul as a tiny particle of the Shekhinah , like a drop in the ocean (Maggid 
Devarav le-Ya'akov 66.) 

Note the parallel here to the exile of the Shekhinah and the Ari's myth of the Shatter- 
ing of the Vessels. Indeed, from a mythic perspective they are one and the same. The 
search for the lost princess is identical to the effort that must be made to Gather the 
Sparks, and in both cases the ultimate aim is to bring about the messianic era. See 
"The Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks," p. 122.

78. LILITH BECOMES GOD'S BRIDE 

After God dismissed His Bride, the Shekhinah , from His presence, at the time of the de- 
struction of the Temple, God brought in a maidservant to take Her place. Who is this 
maidservant? She is none other than Lilith, who once made her home behind the mill, 
and now the servant is heir to her mistress, as it is said, A slave girl who supplants her 
mistress (Prov. 30:23). She rules over the Holy Land as the Shekhinah once ruled over it. 
Thus the slave-woman has become the ruler of the House, and the true Bride has been 
imprisoned in the house of the slave-woman, the evil Lilith. There the Bride is held in 
exile with her offspring, whose hands are tied behind their backs, wearing many chains 
and shackles. That is a bitter time for the exiled Bride, who sobs because Her husband, 
God, does not throw His light upon Her. Her joy has fled because She sees Her rival, 
Lilith, in Her house, deriding Her. And when God sees his true Bride lying in the dust 
and suffering. He, too, will become embittered and descend to save Her from the strang- 
ers who are violating Her. 

So it is that in the days to come news will come to God's consort, Lilith, that the time 
has come for her to go. Then she who plays the harlot will flee from the sanctuary, for if 
she were to come there when the woman of worth was present, she would perish. 

Then God will restore the Shekhinah to Her place as in the beginning, and God and His 
true Bride will again couple with each other in joy. As for the evil slave-woman, God will 
no longer dwell with her, and she will cease to exist. 

This startling myth describes the ascent of the demoness Lilith, in which she be- 
comes God's consort after His separation from his Bride. It is based on an interpreta- 
tion of the verse A slave girl who supplants her mistress (Prov. 30:23). The identification 
of Lilith as once living behind a mill is based on the verse about the slave girl who is 
behind the millstones (Exod. 11:5). In folk tradition, Lilith was especially likely to be 
found in places such as a ruin or behind a mill. Here a strong contrast is made be- 
tween her low beginnings and her ascent to become God's consort. 



60 MYTHS OF COD 


This myth represents the apex of Lilith's ambitions, but it is also understood that 
her position is only temporary— until God's true Bride, the Shekhinah, returns at the 
time of the coming of the Messiah. The ruling presence of the demonic Lilith over the 
Holy Land, as she takes the place of her predecessor, is offered to explain the long 
exile of the Jews that followed the destruction of the Temple and subsequent exile. 

Note that in this version of the separation of God and the Shekhinah , God is de- 
scribed as having dismissed Her rather than an alternate version, also found in the 
Zohar (l:202b-203a), in which the Shekhinah and God have a confrontation about the 
fate of the Temple and the children of Israel sent into exile, and she decides to leave on 
Her own. See "The Exile of the Shekhinah ," p. 57. 

It is impossible to read this myth without seeing a parallel to the story of Abraham 
and Hagar. Hagar was Sarah's maidservant, but when Sarah remained barren, Abraham 
conceived Ishmael, his first child, with Hagar, And when she saw that she had conceived , 
her mistress was lowered in her esteem (Gen. 16:4). The enmity between Sarah and her 
maidservant is thus parallel to that of God's Bride and the maidservant Lilith. 

The Zohar (3:97a) adds a fascinating explanation for the link between Lilith and the 
Shekhinah : "This recondite mystery is that of two sisters." In kabbalistic mythology, the 
Shekhinah represents the feminine aspect of the side of holiness, while Lilith represents 
the feminine aspect of the side of evil. Thus they are tied together, like two sisters. 

The myth ends by predicting the reunion of God and the Shekhinah and the end of 
Lilith's existence. It is unstated but understood that this will take place at the time of 
the coming of the Messiah.

79. ISRAEL AND THE SHEKHINAH IN EXILE 

Whenever Israel went into exile, the Shekhinah was with them. When they were exiled to 
Babylon, the Shekhinah was with them; when they were exiled to Elam, the Shekhinah was 
with them; and when they were exiled in Edom, the Shekhinah was with them. 

When Israel were journeying in the wilderness, the Shekhinah went in front of them, 
and they on their side followed Her guidance. The Shekhinah was accompanied by clouds 
of glory, and when She journeyed, the Israelites took up their march. 

When the Shekhinah ascended, the cloud also ascended on high, so that all men looked 
up and asked: Who is She that comes up from the desert like columns of smoke? (S. of S. 3:6). For 
the cloud of the Shekhinah looked like smoke because the fire that Abraham and his son 
Isaac kindled clung to it and never left it, and by reason of that fire it ascended both as 
cloud and smoke; but for all that it was perfumed, with the cloud of Abraham on the 
right and with the cloud of Isaac on the left. 

And when Israel returns from exile, the Shekhinah will return with them, as it is said, 
With me from Lebanon, O bride, with me you shall come from Lebanon (S. of S. 4:8). 

The presence of the Shekhinah is indicated here by a series of prooftexts. Thus the 
presence of the Shekhinah in Babylon is linked to the verse On your account I zvas sent to 
Babylon (Isa. 43:14). The verse And I will set My throne in Elam (Jer. 49:38) is linked to 
the presence of the Shekhinah there. Likewise, the presence of the Shekhinah in Edom is 
linked to the verse Who is this who coming from Edom? (Isa. 63:1). 

This myth demonstrates how the fate of the Shekhinah and the people of Israel is 
entirely entwined, and that the Shekhinah led the people in their desert wanderings.

MYTHS OF THE BRIDE OF COD 61 


80. GOD'S EXILE WITH ISRAEL 

When the Temple had been destroyed, and Israel was being banished from Jerusalem, 
God said, "Whom among the Fathers would you have lead you? Whether it be Abraham, 
Isaac, or Jacob, whether Moses or Aaron, I shall raise up any one of them from his grave, 
and he will lead you. Or if you would prefer David or Solomon, I shall raise either of 
them and he will lead you." 

The congregation of Israel replied, "Master of the Universe, we do not wish to choose 
any one of these. You are our only Father." 

God replied, "Since that is your wish, I will be your companion, for I Myself will 
accompany you to Babylon." 

Two verses serve as the primary prooftexts of this myth. As to why Israel turned 
down the patriarchs, the verse cited is For Abraham knows us not ... You , O Lord , are our 
Father , our Redeemer (Isa. 63:16). Isaiah 43:14 provides evidence that God accompanied 
the people to Babylon: On your account I was sent to Babylon (Isa. 43:14). 

This myth is unusual in that Israel's rejection of the patriarchs is very uncharacter- 
istic. Reading this midrash through a kabbalistic lens, we might find it unusual that it 
speaks of God, who in kabbalah is masculine, as accompanying the people, rather 
than the Shekhinah, who is usually mentioned in midrashim of this sort, and who the 
kabbalists saw as feminine.

81. THE FACE OF THE SHEKHINAH 

In the days of Moses even the ordinary Israelite had the privilege of being spoken to by 
the Shekhinah face to face. In later times, not even Ezekiel was accorded this privilege. 

It is said that whoever leaves a synagogue and enters the House of Study to engage in 
the study of the Torah will have the merit of seeing the face of the Shekhinah. So too when 
scholars discuss the Torah, they often behold the face of the Shekhinah and are surrounded 
with fire. 

Such was the case when Rabbi Hiyya came to visit Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai. As he passed 
the window, he saw a fiery curtain inside the house, with the Shekhinah on one side of the 
curtain and Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai on the other. They were studying Torah that way, and 
Rabbi Shimon's countenance was aflame with the intoxication of the Torah. 

Rabbi Hiyya was so electrified by this sight that he could not even knock on the door. 
All at once the door opened, and Rabbi Hiyya looked inside. As he did, he glimpsed the 
face of the Shekhinah . And he lowered his eyes and stood frozen in place. 

When Shimon bar Yohai saw that Rabbi Hiyya had been struck dumb, he said to his 
son. Rabbi Eleazar: "Go to Rabbi Hiyya and pass your hand over his mouth." Eleazar did 
this, and at last Rabbi Hiyya recovered his senses. 

Some say that to see the righteous and saintly sages of one's generation is to see the 
very face of the Shekhinah. Why are these called the face of the Shekhinah ? Because the 
Shekhinah is hidden in them, and they reveal Her. 

This much is certain: Before they died and gained entrance to the celestial palace, all 
the saints who had descended from Adam came face to face with the Shekhinah . Of them 
it is said, "A cord of the Divine wilf has been grasped here on earth." 



62 MYTHS OF COD 


The meaning of the phrase "the face of the Shekhinah" can also be understood as the 
presence or immanence of the Divine. In the Kabbalistic era, the figure of the Shekhinah 
shifted from being identified as God's presence in this world to the role of God's Bride. 
However, some scholars, such as Ephraim Urbach in The Sages and Max Kiddushin in 
The Rabbinic Mind, have argued that the term Shekhinah should be regarded as one more 
name of God, like Adonai (the Lord), ha-Shem (the Name), or ha-Makom (the Place), etc. 
Of course, the Name of Names is YHVH, the Tetragrammaton. 

Beginning with the Bible, a living person was forbidden to see God face to face, as 
stated in the verse. No man shall see my face and live (Exod. 33:20) Moses is the sole 
exception. Yet, somehow, it is far more common to see the face of the Shekhinah. This 
suggests that the term Shekhinah was not a simple synonym for God, but a term with 
special meanings, referring to the perception of the presence of God. 

The use of the term face does bring with it suggestions of personification, an im- 
portant fact in light of the later evolution of the term "Shekhinah" to refer to the Bride 
of God. For these descriptions of those who somehow experience the face of the 
Shekhinah have the quality of personal encounters. We note that the Divine appear- 
ance was far more common in the earliest biblical times than later, since even Ezekiel 
was denied the right of seeing the face of God. Yet it could also be argued that his 
detailed account of his vision in the first chapter of the Book of Ezekiel, known as a 
vision of the Merkavah, God's Divine Chariot, is actually another kind of vision of the 
face of the Shekhinah, since both involve visions of God. 

But the best explanation is that the term Shekhinah had one meaning in the rabbinic 
era and another in the kabbalistic and Hasidic ones. Yet even in the rabbinic period 
the precise meaning of Shekhinah" is far from certain, and varies considerably among 
its many sources. See The Immanence of God by J. Abelson for a thorough overview of 
these sources. 

The tale of Rabbi Hiyya's striking glimpse of the face of the Shekhinah is found in the 
Zohar, one of a cycle of tales about Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai and his disciples. In all of these 
tales. Bar Yohai is portrayed as a consummate mystical master, guiding his disciples to 
experience the divine mysteries. Mystical union is the most essential aspect of any mysti- 
cal tradition. Yet it is rarely portrayed as openly as it is here, where Rabbi Hiyya sees the 
face of the Shekhinah inside Shimon bar Yohai's house. He perceives that Shimon bar 
Yohai is studying the Torah with a divine being, with a curtain of fire separating them. 
Note that what Rabbi Hiyya sees is not presented as a vision, but it affects him as a vision- 
ary experience. Indeed, he is so caught up in the moment of mystical union that Rabbi 
Shimon sends his son Eleazar to cover Rabbi Hiyya's mouth, which brings him back to 
this world. One of the fascinating mysteries of this tale is why Bar Yohai chooses to have 
Rabbi Hiyya's mouth covered, and not his eyes, which had witnessed the vision. One 
possible answer is that he does not want to cut off the vision, but rather to prevent Rabbi 
Hiyya's soul from leaving his body during the instant of mystical union. Another possi- 
bility is that since Rabbi Hiyya has been struck dumb, the gesture of the hand restores his 
speech. The curtain of fire that separates Bar Yohai from the Shekhinah suggests both the 
Pargod, the heavenly curtain that separates God from the rest of Paradise, and the curtain 
in the Holy of Holies in the Temple beyond which only the High Priest was permitted to 
go. The fact that a curtain remains separating Rabbi Hiyya and the heavenly being sug- 
gests that even in the grip of powerful mystical experiences, there was not a complete loss 
of self-identity for Jewish mystics, as is so often associated with mystical union in other 
religions. There is also the suggestion that just as God remains apart from the angels, so 
humans must remain separated from divine beings.

VISIONS OF THE BRIDE OF COD 63 


82. THE SHEKHINAH WITHIN 

The Shekhinah dwells inside of each and every Jew, as it is said, I shall dwell in them (Exod. 
25:8). Therefore everyone of Israel must raise up the Shekhinah from Her exile, must raise 
Her up from the dust, and liberate Her from the Sitra Ahra, the Other Side, among whom 
She has been caught. 

Here the concept of the Shekhinah is identified as an interior presence, much like 
the extra soul (neshamah yeterah) that every Jew is said to receive on the Sabbath. In- 
deed, the arrival of the Sabbath Queen, which is one of the names of the Shekhinah , 
and the arrival of the extra soul on the Sabbath is simultaneous. So too is their depar- 
ture simultaneous at the end of Havdalah, the Sabbath closing ceremony. See "The 
Second Soul," p. 310. 

The internal nature of the Shekhinah seems to be particularly associated with Rabbi 
Nachman of Bratslav and his scribe. Rabbi Nathan of Nemirov. Rabbi Nachman's story 
"The Lost Princess" is an allegory about the search for the exiled Shekhinah , about 
which Rabbi Nathan commented: "Everyone of Israel must raise up the Shekhinah 
from her exile," making it a personal as well as a collective task. 

The notion of the internal Shekhinah seems to parallel Carl Jung's later concept of 
the anima, the feminine aspect of a man, who likewise dwells within.

83. THE SHEKHINAH AT THE WALL 

The Shekhinah is said to hover over the Wailing Wall, and She doesn't move from there. 
The northern comer of the Wall is where the Shekhinah reveals herself. Whoever desires 
to see the face of the Shekhinah must devote his life to the study of Torah. Very few have 
been found worthy to see the Shekhinah hovering over the Wall. 

The presence of the Shekhinah is strongly linked to the Western Wall, the retaining 
wall that is all that is said to remain of the Temple in Jerusalem. There are many ac- 
counts in rabbinic texts and Jewish folklore about visions or encounters with the 
Shekhinah at the Wall. But only those who have truly studied the Torah are considered 
worthy of seeing the Shekhinah. See "A Vision at the Wailing Wall," following.

84. A VISION AT THE WAILING WALL 

In those days Rabbi Abraham Berukhim was known for performing the Midnight Vigil. He 
rose every night at midnight and walked through the streets of Safed, crying out, "Arise, 
for the Shekhinah is in exile, and our holy house is devoured by fire, and Israel faces great 
danger." He longed, more than anything else, to bring the Shekhinah out of exile. 

Now Rabbi Abraham was a follower of Rabbi Isaac Luria, known as the Ari. The Ari 
had great mystical powers. By looking at a man's forehead he could read the history of 
his soul. He could overhear the angels and he knew the language of the birds. He could 
point out a stone in a wall and reveal whose soul was trapped in it. So too was he able to

divine the future, and he always knew from the first day of Rosh ha-Shanah who among 
his disciples was destined to live or die. This knowledge he rarely disclosed, but once, 
when he learned there was a way to avert the decree, he made an exception. Summoning 
Rabbi Abraham Berukhim, he said: “Know, Rabbi Abraham, that a heavenly voice has 
gone forth to announce that this will be your last year among us — unless you do what is 
necessary to change the decree." 

"What must I do?" asked Rabbi Abraham. 

"Know, then," said the Ari, "that your only hope is to go to the Wailing Wall in Jerusa- 
lem and pray there with all your heart before God. And if you are deemed worthy you 
will have a vision of the Shekhinah. That will mean that the decree has been averted and 
your name will be inscribed in the Book of Life after all." 

Rabbi Abraham thanked the Ari with all his heart and left to prepare for the journey. 
First he shut himself in his house for three days and nights, wearing sackcloth and ashes, 
and fasted the whole time. Then, although he could have gone by donkey or by wagon, 
he chose to walk to Jerusalem. And with every step he took, he prayed to God to reveal 
such a vision of the Shekhinah to him. By the time Rabbi Abraham reached Jerusalem, he 
felt as if he were floating, as if his soul had ascended from his body. And when he reached 
the Wailing Wall, Rabbi Abraham had a vision there. Out of the wall came an old woman, 
dressed in black, deep in mourning. And when he looked into her eyes, he became pos- 
sessed of a grief as deep as the ocean, far greater than he had ever known. It was the grief 
of a mother who has lost a child; the grief of Hannah, after losing her seven sons; the grief 
of the Shekhinah over the suffering of Her children, the children of Israel, scattered to 
every comer of the earth. 

At that moment Rabbi Abraham fell to the ground in a faint, and he had another vision. 
In this vision, he saw the Shekhinah once more, but this time he saw Her dressed in Her robe 
woven out of light, more magnificent than the setting sun, and Her joyful countenance was 
revealed. Waves of light arose from her face, an aura that seemed to reach out and sur- 
round him, as if he were cradled in the arms of the Sabbath Queen. "Do not grieve so. My 
son Abraham, She said. Know that My exile will come to an end, and My inheritance will 
not go to waste. Your children shall return to their country and there is hope for your future" (Jer. 
31:17). Just then Rabbi Abraham's soul returned to him from its journey on high. He awoke 
refreshed, as if he had shed years of grief, and he was fille d with hope. 

When Rabbi Abraham returned to Safed he was a new man, and when the Ari saw 
him, he said at once: "I can see from the aura shining from your face that you have been 
found worthy to see the Shekhinah, and you can rest assured that you will live for another 
twenty-two years." And he did. 

This mythic story, "A Vision at the Wailing Wall," derives from the city of Safed in 
the sixteenth century. This story comes from the last of three letters written from Safed 
by Shlomel Dresnitz of Moravia in 1607 to his friend in Cracow. It is one of a cycle of 
tales about the great Jewish mystic Rabbi Isaac Luria. These stories about the Ari were 
collected in several volumes, including Shivhei ha-Ari, Sefer Toledot ha-Ari, and Iggerot 
Eretz Yisrael. 

This famous tale has a number of biblical and rabbinic precedents. The final words 
that the Shekhinah speaks to Rabbi Abraham come directly from Jeremiah 31:17. They 
are the words God speaks to console Rachel, weeping for her children (Jer. 31:14-16). 

There is also a strong echo of Jeremiah's vision of Mother Zion in Jeremiah 15:9, which 
is developed in Pesikta Rabbati 26:7. Mother Zion is likely an early incarnation of the 
Shekhinah. See "Mother Zion," p. 46. The assumption that the Shekhinah could still be 
found at the Western Wall, despite the destruction of the Temple, is found in rabbinic 
sources such as Midrash Tehillim on Psalms 11:3 and Exodus Rabbah 2:2, and in Rabbi 
Moshe Alshekh on Lamentations 1:1-2. 



VISIONS OF THE BRIDE OF COD 65 


While this story demonstrates the prophetic wisdom of the Ari, the real focus of 
the story is on one of his disciples. Rabbi Abraham ben Eliezer ha-Levi Berukhim. 
Rabbi Abraham was born in Morocco in 1519 and came to Safed some 50 years later, 
where he was first a follower of Rabbi Moshe Cordovero (1522-1570) and later became 
a disciple of the Ari. Rabbi Abraham was an important figure among the mystics of 
Safed, and Hayim Vital, the primary disciple of the Ari, described him in his autobi- 
ography, Sefer ha-Hezyonot, as someone who could move others to repentance (p. 130). 
Vital, who firmly believed in gilgul, the transmigration of souls, also appears to have 
viewed Rabbi Abraham as the reincarnation of Elijah the Prophet. 

In most versions of this story, there is no mention of Rabbi Abraham performing 
the Midnight Vigil of crying out in the streets because of the exile of the Shekhinah. But 
some variants of this famous tale, such as that in Kav ha-Yashar, add this important 
detail at the beginning of the story, giving new meaning to the Ari's directive for Rabbi 
Abraham Berukhim to seek out the Shekhinah at the Kotel. Devotion to the Midnight 
Ritual indicates that Rabbi Abraham was seeking the Shekhinah before the Ari sent 
him on his quest. In this view, the Ari, well aware of Rabbi Abraham's longing for the 
Shekhinah , simply directed him to seek out the Shekhinah in the right place — at the 
Kotel, the last retaining wall of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. 

This tale lends itself to multiple interpretations. From the traditional perspective, the 
Ari has remarkable powers that enable him to peer into the heavenly ledgers to deter- 
mine the fates of his followers. These fates have been written in either the Book of Life 
or the Book of Death. (See "The Book of Life and the Book of Death," p. 289.) While this 
ability to read in the heavenly ledgers is rare, it is not unheard of. In B. Berakhot 18b, 
there is reference to a pious man who remained in the cemetery on Rosh ha-Shanah and 
there learned the decrees to be issued in heaven during the coming year. 

Or, the Ari may simply have recognized Rabbi Abraham's profound need to en- 
counter the Shekhinah after years of performing the Midnight Vigil and therefore sent 
him to find her. 

Or, from a modern psychological perspective, the Ari has perceived that Rabbi 
Abraham faces a midlife transition. If he continues on his present path, he is shortly 
going to meet his death. That is to say. Rabbi Abraham's life has reached a dangerous 
transition, and in order to survive it, he must undertake an extraordinary task. There- 
fore the Ari sends him on a quest to find the Shekhinah in the logical place where she 
could be found — the Wailing Wall, the remnant of her former home in the Temple in 
Jerusalem. In giving Rabbi Abraham this quest, the Ari functions virtually as a thera- 
pist, sending Rabbi Abraham on a journey to wholeness, to plead for mercy from the 
Shekhinah , who is identified in the kabbalah as the Bride of God. Once he reaches the 
Wall, Rabbi Abraham has dual visions of the Shekhinah , encountering her both as a griev- 
ing old woman and as a radiant bride, and afterward he is a new man, who through this 
visionary experience rediscovers his lost anima and reintegrates his feminine side. 

Rabbi Abraham's visions of the Shekhinah can be recognized as both mythic and ar- 
chetypal, very close to the purest vision of Jung's concept of the anima, the symbolic 
feminine aspect of every man. That is why he is able to live for another 22 years, one 
year for each letter of the Hebrew alphabet, representing a whole new cycle of his life. 

The version in Kav ha-Yashar also makes changes in Rabbi Abraham's vision of the 
Shekhinah. Here, when he raised his eyes, he saw the shape of a woman on top of the 
Wall, instead of emerging from the Wall. Upon seeing Her, Rabbi Abraham fell upon 
on his face, cried and wept, "Mother! Mother! Mother Zion! Woe to me that I see You 
thus." (It is presumed that She is wearing mourning garments.) Further, when Rabbi 
Abraham faints, the feminine figure puts Her hand on his face and wipes away his 
tears. This identification of the Shekhinah with Mother Zion directly links this story 
with that of Mother Zion in Pesikta Rabbati 26:7. See "Mother Zion," p. 46. 

Central to understanding this tale is the concept of the Shekhinah . See the Introduc- 
tion, pp. xlvii-xlix, for a discussion of the evolution of this term. The two appearances of 
Shekhinah that Rabbi Abraham envisions at the Wall, that of the old woman in mourning 



66 MYTHS OF tiOD 


and of the bride in white, are the two primary aspects associated with Her: She appears 
as a bride or queen or lost princess in some texts and tales and as an old woman mourn- 
ing over the destruction of the Temple in others. In "A Vision at the Wailing Wall," She 
appears in both forms. Thus he sees both aspects of the Shekhinah, Her aspect of mourn- 
ing and Her joyful aspect, making his vision of the Shekhinah complete. 

There is much to learn from this tale about how to read rabbinic tales to discover 
the psychic truths at the core of them. First, however, it is necessary to learn how to 
interpret their symbolic language. Identifying the Shekhinah with the anima is the first 
step toward translating this language into an archetypal framework. 

A similar vision of the Shekhinah is recounted by Rabbi Levi Yitzhak of Berditchev. 
See "A Vision of the Bride" in Gabriel's Palace, pp. 245-246.

85. GOD MAKES MATCHES 

God created the world in six days, but what has He been doing ever since? He sits and 
makes matches, assigning this man to that woman and this woman to that man. Indeed, 
God makes these matches even before a child is conceived. Forty days before the forma- 
tion of a child, a voice goes forth out of heaven to announce that this one will be wed to 
that one, and every match is as difficult for God to make as it was to part the waters of the 
Red Sea. And the angels watch over these matches, and when they go well, they sing out, 
"God the Creator of the world and the Matchmaker, blessed be He now and forever." 

This myth answers the question of what God has been doing since He completed 
the creation of the world — He has been making matches, and each one is a difficult 
task, as difficult to make as parting the waters of the Red Sea (if any task can be con- 
sidered difficult for God). This makes God a shadkhan— a matchmaker. This myth also 
explains the Jewish concept of bashert, in which it is believed that each person has a 
bashert or destined one, and that the match was made in heaven. Such a belief made it 
easier to accept the matches that in practice were made by parents, usually with con- 
siderations of status and wealth rather than of any romantic factors. 

According to the Zohar, all souls are initially male and female. But when they are 
bom into this world, the male and female parts of the soul go their separate ways, the 
male soul in a male body and the female soul in a female body. If they are worthy, they 
will unite in marriage, restoring their original unity. That is why a person's loved one 
is called a soulmate, for together they form a single unit in every way, body and soul.

COD DEFERS TO THE EARTHLY COURT 67 


86. THE RABBIS OVERRULE GOD 

Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus was among the sages who were debating a point of the Law. 
All of the sages, except Rabbi Eliezer, ruled one way, and Rabbi Eliezer continued to 
insist that they were wrong. He used every possible argument to support it, but the oth- 
ers did not agree. Then he said: "Let this carob tree prove that the Law is as I state it is." 
The carob tree then uprooted itself and moved a distance of one hundred ells. But the 
other sages said: "That doesn't prove anything." 

Then Rabbi Eliezer said: "Let the waters of the spring prove that I am right." Then the 
waters began to flow backward. But again the sages insisted that this, too, proved nothing. 

Then Rabbi Eliezer spoke again and said: "Let the walls of the house of study prove I 
am right." And the walls were about to collapse when Rabbi Yehoshua said to them: "If 
scholars are discussing a point of the Law, why should you walls interfere?" Thus they 
did not fall, in deference to Rabbi Yehoshua, but neither did they straighten out, out of 
respect for Rabbi Eliezer, and they are inclined to this day. 

Rabbi Eliezer then said: "If the Law is as I say, let heaven prove it." Thereupon a bat kol, 
a heavenly voice, came forth and said: "Why do you quarrel with Rabbi Eliezer, whose 
opinion should prevail everywhere?" 

Then Rabbi Yehoshua stood up and said: "It [the Torah] is not in heaven " (Deut. 30:12). 
"What does this mean?" asked Rabbi Yirmiyahu. "It means that since the Torah was 
given to us on Mount Sinai, we no longer require a heavenly voice to reach a decision, 
since it is written in the Torah: Follow after the majority " (Exod. 23:2). 

Later Rabbi Nathan encountered Elijah and asked him how the ruling was accepted 
on high. And Elijah said: "At this the Holy One, blessed be He, laughed and said, 'My 
children have overruled me!'" 

The subject of the disagreement between Rabbi Eliezer and the other rabbis was 
the ritual purity of a ceramic oven. Rabbi Eliezer insisted it was ritually pure, while all 
of the other sages said it was impure. It seems ironic that a series of miracles, with 
crucial implications about the relationship of God to the rabbis, took place because of 
a such a minor matter. 

This startling legend vividly demonstrates the rabbinic belief that once the Torah 
had been given on Mount Sinai, it became the possession of the Jews, and the respon- 
sibility for interpreting it fell to the rabbis. So extreme is this tale that it suggests that 
the rabbis were not willing to let any authority — even that of God — overrule them. 

And as the coda to the tale reveals, God seems to accept their determination to decide 
the Law as they see fit. 

Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, one of the great talmudic sages, disagrees with his 
fellow sages, and insists on his interpretation to the extent that he provokes miracles — 
the moving of the carob tree, the reversal of the waters of the spring, and the immi- 
nent collapse of the walls of the House of Study. 

Finally, he calls upon heaven to confirm the correctness of his interpretation — and 
heaven replies in his favor. None of this, however, deters the other rabbis from their 
interpretation. Instead, Rabbi Yehoshua virtually tells God to keep out of this matter, 
since, as he says, " The Law is not in Heaven " (Deut. 30: 12). And, indeed, the full context 
of this passage does in fact seem to shift the burden of responsibility for the interpre- 
tation of the Law from God to man: " Surely ; this Instruction which I enjoin upon you this 
day is not too baffling for you , nor is it beyond reach. It is not in the heavens , that you should 
say ; ' Who among us can go up to the heavens and get it for us and impart it to us , that we may 
observe it?' Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say , 'Who among us can cross to the 
other side of the sea and get it for us and impart it to us, that we may observe it?' No, the thing 
is very close to you, in your mouth and in your heart, to observe it" (Deut. 30:11-14). 



68 MYTHS OF COD 


On the other hand, the biblical passage that serves as the basis of the assertion that 
the rabbis, and not God, must decide the Law, Follow after the majority , from Exodus 
23:2, has had its meaning reversed from its original context: You shall not follow a mul- 
titude to do evil This interpretation of the biblical verse is itself a radical example of the 
rabbinic reinterpretation of the text. It demonstrates the extent of the rabbinic deter- 
mination to assume all responsibility for the interpretation of the Law. See B. Sanhedrin 
2a for a discussion of the verse from Exodus.

87. GOD DEFERS TO THE EARTHLY COURT 

All the ministering angels had gathered before God. "Master of the Universe," they asked, 
"what day is New Year's Day?" 

God replied: "Why are you asking Me? Let us, you and I, ask the earthly court. When 
the earthly court decrees that Today is Rosh ha-Shanah, the New Year/ then raise up the 
podium. Summon the advocates. Summon the clerks. For My children have decreed that 
today is New Year's Day, and what is a decree for Israel is an ordinance of the God of 
Jacob." 


The preceding entry, "The Rabbis Overrule God," offers a startling example of rab- 
binic independence from God in matters of interpreting the Torah. Here God defers to 
the rabbis, to the great court of the Sanhedrin, out of respect. God demonstrates that 
in certain matters the opinions of the rabbis take precedence even of God. This is a 
much more conciliatory approach than that taken by Rabbi Yehoshua in "The Rabbis 
Overrule God." Behind this myth is the rabbinic understanding that the Sabbath laws 
are fixed by God, but other holidays, based on the monthly calendar and sighting of 
the new moon, are up to the human courts. 

God's agreement in this matter is deduced from Psalms 81:4-5: Blow the horn on the 
new moon , on the full moon for our feast day. For it is a law for Israel a ruling of the God of 
Jacob. The latter verse about the law and ruling can be understood two ways: the stat- 
ute and ordinance can be seen as a simple repetition, or a statement that God defers to 
Israel to such a great extent that God accepts all of Israel's laws as rulings binding on 
Himself. It is this latter interpretation that is at the root of this myth. 

Two versions of this myth are found in Midrash Tehillim. One version takes place as 
a dialogue between God and the angels, as found here, and the other takes the form of 
an announcement on the part of God. The latter adds a coda from God: If the wit- 
nesses of the new moon are delayed, everything required for the heavenly court will 
have to be stored away, and the New Year will be delayed until the next day. Here 
God is even ready to defer to human frailty, and to delay the starting of the New Year 
if necessary.

BEFORE THE WORLD WAS CREATED 


88. THE FIRST TO EXIST 

As the first to exist, God brought Himself into being. 

Here God is understood to be the First Mover, who brought Himself into being. 
Somehow God crossed the boundary between nonexistence and existence. This is the 
original transition from Ein Sof, meaning "Endless," the unknowable part of God, to 
Keter, meaning "Crown," the first of the ten sefirot. These sefirot describe the process 
of emanation by which the rest of existence came into being.

89. BEFORE THE WORLD WAS CREATED 

In the beginning, before the world was created, God rode upon the wings of the wind and 
upon the flames of storms. Fiery lights of crimson fire blazed around Him. Four great 
storm-winds swirled around Him. A tempest was His chariot, the storm-wind His seat. 

At that time the world was filled with water on water, wave on wave, gale on gale, 
tempest within tempest, storm-wind within storm-wind, making a great clamor until the 
word of God silenced them all. 

Then the sound of praise rose up from the waters, and God said to himself, "If these 
that have neither mouth nor speech praise me, how much more will I be praised when 
man is created." So God gave his consent for the world to be created, as it is said. For He 
spoke and it came to be (Ps. 33:9). 

This mythic portrait of God riding the storm-winds grows out of the passages: For 
behold Yahweh will come in fire, and like the storm-wind (Isa. 66:15), and. Fire goes before 
Him (Ps. 97:3). At the same time, the uncreated world is filled with water, based on the 
verse The voice of Yahweh was upon the waters (Ps. 29:3). Like a god out of Greek mythol- 
ogy, "God rides upon the skies" (Midrash Tehillim 68:3). God first calms the upheavals 
of the waters, and the creation of the world is said to come about after God receives 
the praise of the waters. The association of God with the storm- winds links the Jewish 
God with Marduk, also known as Bel, a god of thunderstorms, originally a Sumerian 
god taken over by the Babylonians, who rose from being a local god to become head 
of the Babylonian pantheon. 

According to Exodus Rabbah (15:22), there were three pre-existent elements: "Three 
things preceded the creation of the world — water, wind and fire." These are the three 
elements found in this mythic description of God.

90. PRIOR WORLDS 

Before the world was created, God alone existed, one and eternal, beyond any boundary, 
without change or movement, concealed within Himself. When the thought arose in Him 
to bring the world into being. His glory became visible. He began to trace the founda- 
tions of a world before Himself, and in this way God brought a heaven and earth into

being. But when God looked at them, they were not pleasing in His sight, so He changed 
them back into emptiness and void. He split and rent and tore them apart with his two 
arms, and ruined whole worlds in one moment. One after another, God created a thou- 
sand worlds, which preceded this one. And all of them were swept away in the wink of 
an eye. 

God went on creating worlds and destroying worlds until He created this one and 
declared, "This one pleases me, those did not." That is how God created the heaven and 
the earth as we know it, as it is said, "For, behold! I am creating a new heaven and a new earth" 
(Isa. 65:17). 


The verse These are the generations of the heaven and the earth when they were created 
(Gen. 2:4) suggested to the rabbis the creation of prior worlds, while the verse You 
carry them away as with a flood (Ps. 90:5) was also interpreted to refer to the destruction 
of these prior worlds. The Zohar (1:262b) suggests that God did not actually build 
these prior worlds, but only thought about building them. 

That this world was not the first that God created was believed to be indicated by 
Isaiah 65:17: For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be 
remembered nor come to mind." Zohar Hadash identifies the prior worlds as totaling 1,000, 
as does Or ha-Hayim 1:12, which states that before God created this world. He created 
a thousand hidden worlds. These hidden worlds were created through the first letter, 
aleph. That is why the Torah, in the report of the Creation of this world, commences 
with the second letter, bet. The existence of the 1,000 worlds is linked to the verse You 
may have the thousand, O Solomon (S. of S. 8:12). 

Other sources, such as Midrash Tehillim 90:13, give the number as 974 worlds, which 
were said to have been created and destroyed over 2,000 years. Sefer ha-Zikhronot 1:1 
suggests that when it entered God's mind to create the world. He drew the plan of the 
world, but it would not stand until God created repentance. Thus repentance is the 
key element that made our world possible. 

Rabbi Yitzhak Eizik Haver (1789-1853) found evidence of prior creations in the fact 
that the Torah starts with the letter bet, the second letter, rather than with an aleph, the 
first letter. "The verse begins with the letter bet to hint that Creation was divided into 
two realms — that God created two beginnings." 

Although a great many prior worlds are said to have been created and destroyed. 
Rabbi Levi Yitzhak of Berditchev insisted that "Everything God created exists forever, 
and never ceases to be." And in Esh Kadosh, Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira identi- 
fies the creation and destruction of the prior worlds with the Shattering of the Vessels. 
Furthermore, he states that God made the present universe out of those broken ves- 
sels. See "The Shattering of the Vessels and Gathering the Sparks," p. 122. 

The belief that God destroyed the prior worlds implies that God's creations of these 
worlds was somehow in error. Some Christian apocryphal sources, such as The Gospel 
of Philip 99a, describe even the present world as an error: "The world came into being 
through a mistake. For He who created it wished to create it imperishable and immor- 
tal. He did not attain his hope."

BEFORE THE WORLD WAS CREATED 73 


91. THE PRIMORDIAL ELEMENTS 

God drew upon six elements in creating the world: light, darkness, chaos, void, wind (or 
spirit), and water. But when were these elements created? Some say these elements pre- 
existed, and that God drew upon them in the Creation. Others say they were created in 
an earlier creation. Still others say that they too were created on the first day, along with 
heaven and earth. 

The very existence of pre-existing elements, such as light, darkness, chaos, void, water, 
wind, and the deep, raise doubts about the singularity of God's accomplishment. Yet 
there is no explicit mention of the creation of these elements in the account of Creation. 

To demonstrate that God did indeed create these elements. Rabbi Gamaliel in Gen- 
esis Rabbah provides prooftexts to show that all seven were created, such as in Isaiah 
45:7, where God says, "I form light and create darkness." However, this proof raises as 
many questions as it resolves. The use of the verb "form" (yotzer) for the creation of 
light and "create" ( borei ) for the creation of darkness is significant. Something that is 
formed already exists, while something that is created is brought into being. This seems 
to hint that light pre-existed.

92. GOD CREATED EVERYTHING WITH ITS KNOWLEDGE 

God looked over the entire creation before it existed and prepared everything during the 
six days of Creation. During those six days the foundations and roots of everything that 
would be brought into being were created. 

So too did God create everything with its knowledge. God asked each thing if it wanted to 
be created. When each thing agreed to be created, it was with specific conditions, and with its 
own particular mode of service to God. The ocean agreed to open up to permit the children of 
Israel to pass through the Red Sea. The heavens promised to be silent while Moses climbed 
Mount Sinai. The sun and moon promised to stand still when Joshua stood before the walls 
of Jericho. The ravens promised to feed Elijah, the lions promised not to devour Daniel, the 
heavens promised to open up before Ezekiel, and the whale to cast out Jonah. 

In this way God made an agreement with each of the elements, and each and every 
one agreed to do as God asked, out of gratitude for having been created. 

There are some Jewish creation myths in which God created the world from a blue- 
print. That idea is echoed here, but instead of a plan it seems to suggest that God 
visualized, in some way, all that He would create. Philo states that "when God de- 
cided to create this world. He first formed the invisible world to use as a pattern for 
the corporeal world." That idea is echoed here, suggesting that "the roots of every- 
thing" which God prepared was an invisible, archetypal world, or that God visual- 
ized, in some way, all that He would create. Other myths describe God using the 
Torah as a blueprint for all of Creation. See "The Creation of the Torah," p. 249. 

In addition, we find the concept that God consulted with all of his creations, asking 
them if they wanted to be created. The implication is that all things subsequently 
created expressed their desire to exist. This explains the powerful impulse to survive 
in all living beings. God's questioning of the creatures prior to their creation implies a 
covenant between God and His creations, and implies a mutuality to the process of 
creation.

93. THE BEGINNING OF TIME 

Time did not exist before the world was created, but came into being at the same time. 

Here Philo considers the question of the beginning of time. He concludes that time 
did not exist until God created the world, but "came into being at the same time." 
Thus time does not exist for God, but only for God's creations.

94. SEVEN THINGS CREATED BEFORE THE 
CREATION OF THE WORLD 


Seven things were created before the creation of the world. They are: the Torah, Repen- 
tance, Paradise, Gehenna, the Throne of Glory, the heavenly Temple, and the name of the 
Messiah. The Messiah's name was engraved on a precious stone on the altar of the heav- 
enly Temple, as it is said. His name existed before the sun CPs^72:17). Nor will King Messiah 
ever know death. All seven preceded the creation of the world by two thousand years, 
and all were borne up by the power of God. 


The celestial Torah was written in black fire on white fire, and lay in the lap of God, 
who sat on the Throne of Glory, which was set in the highest heaven, above the heads of 
the angels and seraphs and other heavenly beasts still to be created. Paradise was on the 
right side of God and Gehenna on the left. The heavenly sanctuary was directly in front 
of Him, and the name of the Messiah was engraved on a precious stone set upon the altar. 
As for Repentance, it is great indeed, for it preceded the creation of the world. 

Only after God created these seven things, along with the heavenly beasts, did God 
establish the firmament, with all seven things created before the Creation resting upon 
the horns of these beasts, as it is said. And over the heads of the heavenly beasts there was the 
~ likenes s ofa firmament ( Ezek. 1 :22). That firmament consists of precious stones and pearls. 
It lights up the heaven as the sun lights up the world at noon, as it is said. And light dwells 
with Him (Dan. 2:22). 


God is said to have created these seven things 2,000 years before the creation of the 
world (Midrash Tehillim 90:12). These seven things are regarded as the indispensable 
essentials for the world to exist. Each of these seven things is explained by a verse that 
suggests they were created before the rest of the creation of the world. The Torah's 
pre-existence is supported by the verse Ths_ Lord possess ed me in the beginning of His 
, way, before His worksof old (Prov. 8:2 2). The Throne of Glory is found in the verse Your 
throne is establishedfrom of old (Ps. 93:2). Paradise ( Gan Eden, the Garden of Eden, which 
represents both the heavenly and the earthly Paradise) can be presumed to have pre- 
existed by the verse The Lord God planted a garden in Eden (Gen. 2:8). A case for Gehenna 
(hell) can be found in the verse The Topheth has long been ready for him (Isa. 30:33). A 
place called Topheth was the site of a cult that involved the sacrifice of children to 
Moloch (see 2 Kings 23:10). It is in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, south of Jerusalem, 
which came to be known as Gehinnom and came to represent the place where the 
wicked were tormented after death. The Greek form, "Gehenna," became the popu- 
larly known name for this place of punishment, which is the Jewish equivalent of a 
combined purgatory and hell. The Temple, with its Throne of Glory, can be found in 
the verse O Throne of Glory exalted from of old, our sacred shrine! (Jer. 17:12). For the 
Messiah, we may look to the verse May his name be eternal; while the sun lasts, may his 
name endure (Ps. 72:17). The pre-existence of repentance can be found in the verse 



THE CREATION OF THE WORLD 75 


Before the mountains came into being , before You brought forth the earth and the world ... You 
return man to dust ; you decreed, " Return you mortals /" (Ps. 90:2-3). (In Hebrew the word 
for "returning/' teshuvah, also means "repentance.") Most of the details about the seven 
things created before the creation of the world are found in Midrash Tehillim 90:12. 
This text also links the seven sacred things to the vision of Ezekiel, asserting that each 
of the seven things exists upon the horns of the hayyot, the living creatures envisioned 
in Ezekiel 1:13-14. 

According to Nachmanides, God's original Torah in heaven was written with black 
fire on white fire, and the letters were written without spaces between the words. 
Rabbi Meir ibn Gabbai said that the Torah was literally 

How long before the world was created were the seven things brought into being? 
Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said that they were created 2,000 years before the creation 
of the world. 

Taken as a whole, the seven things portray the parameters of existence: the Torah is 
the supreme source of instruction. Paradise and Gehenna represent reward and punish- 
ment, the Throne of Glory represents God's role in existence, the heavenly Temple im- 
plies the creation of the earthly Temple in the days to come, and the name of the Messiah 
signifies the End of Days. Finally, Repentance adds the human need for forgiveness.

95. THE SEVEN DAYS OF CREATION 

In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Now the earth was unformed and 
void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God hovered over the 
face of the waters. God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light. God saw that the light 
was good, and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the 
darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, a first day. 

God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water, that it may separate water 
from water." God made the expanse, and it separated the water that was below the ex- 
panse from the water that was above the expanse. And it was so. God called the expanse 
Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day. 

God said, "Let the water below the sky be gathered into one area, that the dry land 
may appear." And it was so. God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering of waters 
He called Seas. And God saw that this was good. And God said, "Let the earth sprout 
vegetation: seed-bearing plants, fruit trees of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the 
seed in it." And it was so. The earth brought forth vegetation: seed-bearing plants of 
every kind, and trees of every kind bearing fruit with the seed in it. And God saw that 
this was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a third day. 

God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate day from night; they 
shall serve as signs for the set times — the days and the years; and they shall serve as 
lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth." And it was so. God made the 
two great lights, the greater light to dominate the day and the lesser light to dominate the 
night, and the stars. And God set them in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth, 
to dominate the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw 
that this was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day. 

God said, "Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and birds that fly 
above the earth across the expanse of the sky." God created the great sea monsters, and 
all the living creatures of every kind that creep, which the waters brought forth in swarms, 
and all the winged birds of every kind. And God saw that this was good. God blessed 
them, saying, "Be fertile and increase, fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds increase 
on the earth." And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day. 



76 MYTHS OF CREATION 


God said, "Let the earth bring forth every kind of living creature: cattle, creeping things, 
and wild beasts of every kind." And it was so. God made wild beasts of every kind and 
cattle of every kind, and all kinds of creeping things of the earth. And God saw that this 
was good. And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. They shall 
rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the cattle, the whole earth, and all the creeping 
things that creep on earth." And God created man in His image, in the image of God He 
created him; male and female He created them. God blessed them and God said to them, 
"Be fertile and increase, fill the earth and master it; and rule the fish of the sea, the birds 
of the sky, and all the living things that creep on earth." 

God said, "See, I give you every seed-bearing plant that is upon all the earth, and every 
tree that has seed-bearing fruit; they shall be yours for food. And to all the animals on land, to 
all the birds of the sky, and to everything that creeps on earth, in which there is the breath of 
life, I give all the green plants for food." And it was so. And God saw all that He had made, 
and found it very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day. 

The heaven and the earth were finished, and all their array. On the seventh day God 
finished the work that He had been doing, and He ceased on the seventh day from all the 
work that He had done. And God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy, because 
on it God ceased from all the work of Creation that He had done. Such is the story of 
heaven and earth when they were created. 

This is the most famous of all Jewish creation myths. It appears at the very begin- 
ning of Genesis and is known, at least in rough outline, even by those who have little 
knowledge of the Bible. The only biblical account that is equally famous is that of the 
disobedience of Adam and Eve. This Creation narrative emphasizes God's use of the 
power of the word in order to create the world. On each day of Creation, additional 
elements are brought into being when God commands that they appear. On the sur- 
face this seems to be creation ex nihilo, out of nothing, but a close reading of the bibli- 
cal text shows a certain amount of ambiguity about whether God drew on pre-existing 
elements or created everything Himself. Every subsequent Jewish creation myth re- 
fers directly or indirectly to this one. It either verifies the principles established here, 
or contradicts them, implying, for example, that some elements, such as light, already 
existed when God said, "Let there be light" (Gen. 1:3). See "Light from the Temple," p. 

411, where this theory is elaborated. Following the seven days of Creation is a second 
creation myth. Genesis 2:4-25, which offers a different perspective on the events of 
Creation, emphasizing the creation of man and woman. Scholars have proposed that 
these were two separate creation myths that were combined by the priestly editors of 
Genesis, despite some apparent contradictions. See "The Creation of Man," p. 133, 
and "The Creation of Woman," p. 142. 

This seminal creation myth also had a great influence on the way God was con- 
ceived. It can be argued that the personification of God begins in Genesis 1:2: God said , 

" Let there be light " Since humans also speak, using language just as God is said to do, 
it was natural to assume that God had other human characteristics. As a result of this 
myth, it has been assumed that all God's creations came into existence through the 
words uttered by God, as made explicit in this passage from Psalms: By the word of 
Yahweh the heavens were made , by the breath of His mouth , all their hosts (Ps. 33:6). 

There are many parallels between the Genesis Creation myth and the creation myths 
of other peoples of the ancient Near East. One of the closest is the Mesopotamian 
creation myth found in Enuma Elish, where the divine assembly of Mesopotamia is 
created through the merging of Apsu, divine patron of fresh water, and Tiamat, divine 
patron of salt water. An Egyptian creation myth is preserved in the Hymn to Ra, the 
creator and ruler identified with the sun, where Ra describes creation: "There were no 
heavens and no earth. There was no dry land and there were no reptiles in the land. 

Then I spoke and living creatures appeared." A seven-day incubation ritual is de- 
scribed in the Ugaritic stories of Aqhat. A hymn to the creator of the heavens and the 



THE CREATION OF THE WORLD 77 


earth was found among the tablets unearthed at Ebla in Syria: "You are the creator of 
the heavens and the earth. There was no earth until you created it. There was no light 
until you created it. There was no sun until you created it. You alone rule over all 
creation." For more on the parallels among creation myths, see "The Rebellion of the 
Waters," p. 105, and "The Rebellion of Rahab," p. 106.

96. TEN THINGS CREATED ON THE 
EVE OF THE FIRST SABBATH 

Ten things were created at twilight on the sixth day of Creation, before the first Sabbath: 
the mouth of the earth, the mouth of the well, the mouth of the she-ass, the rainbow, the 
manna, the staff of Moses and the Shamir, as well as the letters and writing and the 
Tablets of stone. 

Some add the following things: the evil spirits and the sepulcher of Moses, the cave in 
which Moses and Elijah stood, as well as the ram of our father Abraham. Some also add 
the first tongs that were ever made. 

The Mishnah lists these items that later took on an important role in Jewish lore. 

The mouth of the earth is the place where the earth opened and swallowed Korah and 
his followers (Num. 16:32). The well is one that God gave to the people in the wilder- 
ness (Num. 21:16-18). The ass is that of Balaam, which spoke (Num. 22:28). The rain- 
bow is that of Noah (Gen. 9:23). The manna is that given to the Israelites in the 
wilderness (Exod. 16:15). The staff (or rod) of Moses is found in Exodus 4:17. The 
tablets are the first tablets given to Moses (Exod. 32:15). See "The First Tablets," p. 266. 

The Shamir is a small creature, the size of a barleycorn, which can cut through the 
hardest stone. King Solomon is said to have used it to cut the stones for the Temple. 

There is a famous folktale in the Talmud in which King Solomon captures Ashmedai, 
the king of demons, in order to find out where he can capture the Shamir, so that he 
can use it to carve the stone altar for the Temple (B. Gittin 68b). 

Of the additional items said to have been created at twilight on the sixth day, the 
spirits refer to the souls that were left without bodies. There was not enough time for 
a body to be created for every soul. This is said to be the origin of the demons. For the 
sepulcher of Moses, see Deuteronomy 34.6. The ram is the one that Abraham sacri- 
ficed at Mount Moriah in place of Isaac (Gen. 22:13). Finally, the heavenly origin of the 
first tongs solves the problem of how the first tongs might have been held while they 
were being made.

97. FIVE HEAVENLY THINGS SLEEPING IN THE UNIVERSE 

There are five heavenly things in the universe, each of them of immense power, that are 
sleeping. They are the might of God, the rainbow of God, the sword of God, the arm of 
God, and the jealousy of God. 



78 MYTHS OF CREATION 


These five heavenly things are each a giant force in repose. Each of them belongs to 
God, from objects linked to God, such as the rainbow and the sword, to God's arm, 
which is part of God, and powers and characteristics of God, such as His might and 
His jealousy. This brief, largely undeveloped myth serves as a reminder of God's un- 
limited powers, which can be asserted at any time, with unforeseen consequences. It 
also suggests multiple aspects of God, that God consists of a mixture of elemental 
forces. This would explain God's sometimes contradictory behavior, ranging from 
mercy to harsh justice.

Midrash Tehillim 80:3. 


98. GOD THE CREATOR 

In the beginning, God covered Himself with light as with a garment. He stretched out the 
heavens like a curtain, laying the roof of His upper chambers with the waters. He made 
the clouds His chariot, walking upon the wings of the winds, making winds His messen- 
gers, and the flaming fire His ministers. So too did He establish the earth upon its foun- 
dations that it should never be moved, and He covered it with the deep. But when the 
waters rose up above the mountains, God rebuked them and they fled at the voice of His 
thunder. The mountains rose, the valleys sank down to the place where God had founded 
them. And He set a boundary for the waters that could not be crossed, that they might 
not return to cover the earth. 

This is an especially important passage from Psalms, which demonstrates clear 
evidence of ancient creation myths beyond those found in Genesis. This version of the 
Creation gives God a more active, mythic role. God stretches out the heavens, lays the 
roof of His upper chambers, establishes the earth on its foundations, and covers it 
with the deep. Even the creation of light is described in very active terms, with God 
covering Himself with light as with a garment. In contrast, in the Genesis creation 
myth God's actions are limited to speech — God speaks and everything comes into 
existence. Thus the portrayal of God in this myth from Psalms is far closer to that of 
polytheism, as found in Babylonian, Canaanite, and Greek myth. For additional myths 
about the creation of light, see "The Light of the First Day," p. 83.

Psalms 104:1-9. 


99. THE RAINBOW 

Some say that the rainbow was created by God at the time of Noah, when God set it in the 
clouds. It came into being when God strengthened the power of the sun after the Flood, 
so that its rays would produce a rainbow. Others say that the rainbow was one of the ten 
things created on the eve of the first Sabbath, but until the time of Noah it was hidden in 
the clouds, and only God could see it. God revealed the rainbow to Noah as the sign of 
the covenant between them. The rainbow had been designated for this purpose from the 
time of its creation. 

God said, "I have set My bow in the clouds" (Gen. 9:13), meaning that the beauty of the 
bow was comparable to that of God. Still, as beautiful as the rainbow was, it was but a 
faint reflection of God's glory. It is forbidden to stare at the rainbow because the Shekhinah 
appears in it, adorned in garments yellow, red, and white. That is why the eyes of anyone 
who stares at the rainbow will become dim. 



THE CREATION OF THE WORLD 79 


Sometimes the rainbow does not appear at all during a generation. This indicates there 
is a Tzaddik in that generation, and therefore the world does not need a sign that God will 
not destroy it. Such a righteous one prays for compassion for the world and is worthy of 
protecting it. 

From time to time the rainbow appears in the sky to reassure us that despite our sins, 
God will not annihilate us. 

There is a debate among biblical commentators about whether or not the rainbow 
existed before God revealed it to Noah as a sign of their covenant as stated in the verse 
"I have set My how in the clouds" (Gen. 9:13). The past tense of "I have set" was taken as 
evidence that the rainbow existed before Noah. Among the commentators, Saadiah 
Gaon asserted that the rainbow was previously in existence, while Ibn Ezra inter- 
preted this verse to mean, "I have now set a bow in the clouds." 

According to Rabbi Moshe Alshekh (sixteenth century), each of the seven colors of 
the rainbow represents one day in the seven days of Creation. 

Rabbi Joshua ben Levi wanted anyone who saw a rainbow to prostrate himself, to 
acknowledge the wisdom of God in all that He has created. But other rabbis scoffed at 
this idea, since it would appear that the one prostrating himself was worshipping the 
rainbow. 

In B. Ketubot 77b, it is said that the rainbow did not appear in the sky during the 
generation of Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai as a sign of his righteousness, since the merit of 
one Tzaddik alone is enough to save the world, and therefore the rainbow, itself a sign 
of God's mercy, is not needed, since the presence of a great Tzaddik is in itself sufficient 
to invoke God's mercy. This tradition is repeated in Zohar 3:15a, where Rabbi Shimon 
bar Yohai is the hero and reputed author of the book. 

The association of the rainbow and the Shekhinah grows out of Ezekiel 1:28: As the 
appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain , so was the appearance of the 
brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory ofYahweh. 

In the Zohar , Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai associates the colors of the garment of the 
Shekhinah — yellow, red and white — with the three patriarchs, Abraham with white, 

Isaac with red, and Jacob with yellow. See "The Garments of the Shekhinah" p. 54.

100. THE TIME OF CREATION 

When was the world created? It is one of the foundations of Judaism that God created the 
world at the precise instant that He desired to do so. 

What existed before that? Whoever speculates about four things, it is better if he had not 
been bom: What is above? What is below? What came before? And what will come after? 

There is little speculation in Jewish lore about what God did before He created the 
world, or what, if anything, existed before then. The one major exception are the myths 
about prior worlds. See "Prior Worlds," p. 71. So too is little said about God's decision 
to create the world when He did. But Me' am Lo'ez emphasizes God's own free will in 
deciding when to undertake Creation, "at the precise instant that He desired to do 
so." According to Jewish philosophy, while human free will may be encumbered by a 
person's fate, God's free will is limitless, and His decision to create the universe and 
make a covenant with Israel was entirely God's own choice. The only exception seems 



80 MYTHS OF CREATION 


to be some strata of Lurianic Kabbalah where the process of creation /emanation seems 
to be a necessity within God, although His free will initiates the whole process. 

This famous quotation from Mishnah Hagigah 2:1 lists four things it is forbidden to 
speculate about. It represents that dimension of rabbinic thought that was alarmed at 
even the study of mystical contemplation, and warned against its dangers. Indeed, the 
tale of the four sages who entered Paradise, from B. Hagigah 14b, is itself a warning tale 
about the dangers of mystical explorations. See "The Four Who Entered Paradise," p. 173.

101. EVERYTHING WAS CREATED AT ONCE 

The entire universe was created at once. Everything was created in one moment, in the same 
hour, on the same day, as it is said. Such is the story of heaven and earth on the day that they were 
created (Gen. 2:4). Not only were heaven and earth created on that day, but they were not 
deficient in any way. They contained their descendants within them, existing in potential. 

This myth of the simultaneous creation of the universe strongly echoes the modem 
Big Bang theory of creation. It finds its basis in the phrase on the day that they were 
created , which seems to imply that heaven and earth were created on the same day 
While this myth would appear to contradict the sequential creation described in Gen- 
esis 1:1-31, it avoids this by stating that the potential for subsequent creation already 
existed.

Midrash ha-Ne'elam, Zohar Hadash 2d, 13d. 


102. HOW GOD BEGOT BEING 

God was the father of all that was begotten, and the mother was God's knowledge. God 
had intercourse with knowledge — not in human fashion — and begat being. Knowledge 
received the divine seed and gave birth, with many birth-throes, bearing the only be- 
loved son, this world. 

This is a strange philosophical creation myth of Philo, in which God, the father, has 
intercourse with knowledge (gnosis in Greek), the mother, and as a result the world, 
their only son, was begotten. Philo's use of the metaphor of human intercourse for 
divine forces implies a kind of mythic personification of them, and demonstrates the 
mythic dimension lying close to the surface in Philo's writing, despite his efforts to 
use allegory as a way of denying the mythic realm.

103. WHAT DOES THE EARTH STAND ON? 

Once, when Aaron the Priest, brother of Moses, was offering sacrifices on Yom Kippur, 
the bull sprang up from beneath his hands and covered a cow. When that calf was bom, 
it was stronger than any other. Before a year was out, the calf had grown bigger than the 
whole world. 



THE CREATION OF THE WORLD 81 


God then took the world and stuck it on one horn of that bull. And the bull holds up the 
world on his horn, for that is God's wish. But when people sin, their sins make the world 
heavier, and the burden of the bull grows that much greater. Then the bull grows tired of its 
burden, and tosses the world from one horn to the other. That is when earthquakes take 
place, and everything is uncertain until the world stands secure on a single horn. 

So it is that the bull tosses the world from time to time from one horn to the other, 
causing earthquakes and other catastrophes. And if people only knew of the danger, they 
would recognize how much they are dependent on God's mercy. For if they would only 
observe the commandments and sanctify God's name, the bull would stand still and the 
world remain quietly on its horns. 

This Moroccan myth about God putting the world on one hom of a giant bull dem- 
onstrates that myths, as well as folktales, can be found among the abundant tales 
collected orally in Israel by the Israel Folktale Archives. While many of these myths 
are found in earlier texts, sometimes, as here, a myth is passed down orally and is not 
to be found in the written tradition. This myth reminds us of myths from other cul- 
tures about what the world stands on, such as the widespread belief in South Asia and 
among North American Indians that the earth rests on the back of a turtle. Not only 
does this myth explain what the world stands on (since it appears to be standing still), 
but also provides an explanation for earthquakes and other disasters. Note the gen- 
esis of the bull that grows to be bigger than the world — it is bom from the unplanned 
copulation of a bull about to be sacrificed on Yom Kippur. What the myth does not 
address is the obvious contradiction that the world already existed at the time of Aaron, 
brother of Moses, the first High Priest.

104. CREATION EXNIHILO 

When God created the world. He created it out of nothing and brought it into being. Who 
can understand what the Creator had in mind when He willed the universe to come into 
existence? 

Some say that it was only the body of heaven that was created from nothing, while its 
form was created from the light above. 

God is the Cause of all creation. It is God who sustains the existence of all that exists, 
for nothing can exist unless it emanates from God. 

Creation Ex Nihilo means creation out of nothing. This is the ultimate form of cre- 
ation, in that it demonstrates that the power of the Creator is total. This myth, in its 
variants, emphasizes that God did indeed create the world out of nothing, and there- 
fore emphasizes God's complete and utter mastery of all elements related to creation 
and existence.

105. THE ORDER OF CREATION 

The universe was created from the top down. The upper worlds were created first, and 
each and every subsequent world was created from the world above it. Thus it was not 



82 MYTHS OF CREATION 


possible to hasten or to delay the creation of the world, but each development took place 
in turn. In this way all the worlds were brought into being, each one later than the other, 
until it came to be time for this world to be created. 

This myth answers the question of whether God started Creation with the upper 
or lower worlds. This is a prominent question in the midrash. This is also a version of 
the myth of prior worlds. See "Prior Worlds," p. 71. This world is the last to be created 
in a succession of worlds. The difference in this kabbalistic myth and the earlier, rab- 
binic one is that the prior worlds are destroyed in the earlier version, while here they 
became the foundation of the building blocks of the universe. The other important 
point of this myth is not simply that lower worlds were created after upper ones, but 
that lower worlds were created from upper ones.

106. GOD'S GARMENT OF LIGHT 

How did God create the heavens? Some say that God wrapped Himself in a prayer shawl, 
a tallit of light, and the light cast from that prayer shawl suffused the world. That gar- 
ment of light was covered with the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, inscribed in black fire 
on white fire. 

Others say that God draped the six days of Creation around Himself like a gown and 
dazzled the universe with His glory from one end to the other. 

Then there are those who say that God took the light and stretched it like a garment, 
and the heavens continued to expand until God said, "Enough!" 

God said , " Let there be light." And there was light (Gen. 1:3). This enigmatic verse 
raises as many questions as it answers. Did God create this light out of nothing, or did 
this light pre-exist? This question receives a number of answers in rabbinic sources, 
all of them based on interpretations of Psalms 104:2: Who cover Yourself with light as 
with a garment , who stretches out the heavens like a curtain. One such interpretation grows 
out of a dialogue between Rabbi Simeon ben Jehozadak and Rabbi Samuel bar 
Nachman in Genesis Rabbah 3:4. Rabbi Simeon asked the other, "How did God create 
light?" Rabbi Samuel replied in a whisper that God wrapped himself in a white gar- 
ment, and when Rabbi Simeon noted that this explanation is found in Psalms 104:2 
(and is therefore not esoteric, requiring a whisper). Rabbi Samuel explained: "I re- 
ceived this tradition in a whisper, so I passed it on in a whisper." Why would this 
teaching have been conveyed in a whisper? Because it hints that the light somehow 
pre-existed. This would imply that while God was the Creator, He created using exist- 
ing building blocks, which might be viewed as diminishing God's accomplishment. 

In addition, there is a Gnostic interpretation in which the light of God's garment is 
identified with the First Created Being. See "The First Created Being," p. 118. This 
interpretation would certainly justify the use of a whisper. 

The view that light itself was a kind of primordial element, along with darkness, 
chaos, and void ( tohu and vohu ), is found in "Light from the Temple," p. 411. Such an 
interpretation is also found in Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 6, which interprets the verse from 
Psalms 104:2 to mean that God took of an existing light and stretched it out to create 
the world: "How were the heavens created? From the light of the garment with which 
God was robed. He took this light and stretched it like a garment and the heavens 
began to extend until He said, 'Enough!'" 

Another verse used to explain God's wearing of a garment at the time of the Cre- 
ation is Psalms 104:1: You are clothed with glory and majesty. This is said to be the first of 
ten occasions in which God clothed himself in a garment (Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 22:5). 



THE PRIMORDIAL LIOHT 83 


Rabbi Moshe Alshekh suggests in his commentary on Psalm 104 that the light that 
God draped around Himself was that of the six days of Creation. Only after God 
draped the six days in this fashion did Creation proceed. Alshekh also suggests that 
"clothing Himself in light" refers to the creation of God's Throne of Glory; and that 
the purpose of the Throne of Glory was to protect the world from the damaging ef- 
fects of God's emanations. Thus the light serves as a kind of protective intermediary 
between God and the rest of creation, for God's original light proved too brilliant for 
the material universe to endure. 

The tradition that God wore a fringed prayer shawl (tallit) is found in other sources. 
For example, God is said to have demonstrated the nature of such a prayer shawl to 
Moses by appearing to him in a garment with fringed comers. This is said to be one of 
the things that Moses could comprehend only after God demonstrated it to him.

107. THE LIGHT OF THE FIRST DAY 

Before the world was created, the thought arose in God's mind to create a light to illumi- 
nate it. So on the first day of Creation, God wrapped Himself in a garment of light, and the 
radiance of His majesty illuminated the world. That was the light of the first day, a primor- 
dial light, distinct from the light of the fourth day, when God created the sun, the moon, 
and the stars. That light was the first thing that God created and it completely suffused all 
of existence without beginning or end. Everything was filled with that light, which trav- 
eled throughout the cosmos without stopping, until all the world began to sing. Thus it is 
written. He sends it forth under the whole heaven , , and His light to the ends of the earth (Job 37:3). 

The light created on the first day accompanied all the days of Creation, and thus all the 
days are contained in the first day, for the world was created through that sacred light. It 
is the light of the eye. In that light Adam saw from one end of the universe to the other, 
and he was also able to view the world from the beginning of Creation until the end. For 
it was not only possible to see tangible things in this light, but even ethereal things, which 
are otherwise invisible. 

Where did the light come from? Some say it was the light of Paradise, which God 
brought into the world at the time of Creation. For the first three days and nights, the 
primordial light shone undiminished. Seven times brighter than the sun, it was so in- 
tense that no created thing could gaze upon it. 

Others say that the light existed even before the Creation. When God said, "Let there be 
light , " light came forth from the place in the universe where the Temple in Jerusalem would 
one day be built. Surrounded by that light, God completed the creation of the world. 

How, then, did God bring the light into the world? Some say that God wrapped himself 
in a prayer shawl of light, and the light cast from that prayer shawl suffused the world. 
Others say that God draped the six days of Creation around Himself like a gown and 
dazzled the universe with His glory from one end to the other. Then there are those who 
say that God took the light and stretched it like a garment, and the heavens continued to 
expand until God said, "Enough!" Still others say that the light was cast from the very 
countenance of God. 



84 MYTHS OF CREATION 


How long did the light shine? Some say that the light of the first day accompanied all 
seven days of Creation, and all the days that followed contain the essence of the first. 
Therefore the light of the first day is still with us, dimmed though it may be. 

Others say that this light shone undiminished for the first three days and nights of 
Creation. Seven times brighter than the sun, the primordial light was so intense that no 
created thing could gaze upon it. Still others say that the light created on the first day 
served thirty-six hours, twelve on the Sabbath eve, twelve on the Sabbath day, and twelve 
on the night of the Sabbath. 

That sacred light pervaded the world until the very moment that Adam and Eve tasted 
the forbidden fruit. Then the first thing they lost was that precious light, for God, seeing 
the wicked deeds of the coming generations, hid the primordial light at once. Without it, 
the world grew dark around them, for the sun shone like a candle in comparison. Never 
again did they see the world in the splendor of that light, and that was the most painful 
punishment of all. 

As for the fate of the primordial light, some say that God brought it back into Paradise, 
where it awaits the righteous in the World to Come. On the other hand, that light will be 
denied to the wicked, as it is said. The light of the wicked is withheld (Job 38:15). Others say 
that God gave that light as a gift to His Bride, the Shekhinah. Still others say that God hid 
that light in the Torah, in the mysteries concealed there, waiting to be discovered. And 
wherever the Torah is studied, a thread of this light is drawn down upon those who 
study it, as it is said. Light is sown for the righteous (Psalms 97:11). And when it is, the 
hidden light of the Torah is revealed to them in all its splendor. 

Still others say that the light has continued to exist since the days of Adam, but that 
God has hidden it, so that the wicked will be unable to misuse it. For had it been com- 
pletely removed, the world would not continue to exist for even one moment. Instead, it 
is concealed and the world is sustained. Not a day passes without some of this light 
being emitted to the world so that it can continue to exist. This is how God nourishes the 
world, for God has saved this light for the righteous at the End of Days, when the foot- 
steps of the Messiah will be heard. Had the primordial light been completely concealed, 
the world would not continue to exist for even one moment. 

So too is it said that God hid a small bit of that light inside a glowing stone, and gave 
it to Adam and Eve when they were expelled from the Garden, as a reminder of all that 
they had lost. 

At the End of Days, when the footsteps of the Messiah will be heard in the world, that 
sacred light will be restored. Then everyone will see the true glory of God's creation.

THE PRIMORDIAL LI6HT 85 


108. THE FIRST CLOAK 

Light was the very first creation on the first day; thus light was the first cloak in which God 
concealed His spiritual essence, as it is said. Cloaked in light as with a garment (Ps. 104:2). 

Some say that God created the angels out of that primal light. For angels are a pure 
spiritual force radiating light, and the angels surround God the way a cloak envelops 
whoever wears it. 

The extensive rabbinic tradition about the or ha-ganuz, the primordial light that has 
since been concealed, is frequently linked to Creation, in that the light is regarded as 
the first manifestation of the God's essence. Here the creation of light is directly linked 
to the creation of the angels, and the angels are viewed as being a spiritual essence 
consisting entirely of light. Psalm 104 contains fragments of ancient Jewish creation 
myths. See Psalm 104:1-9. Also, see "The Light of the First Day," p. 83, and "The Cre- 
ation of Angels," p. 115.

109. THE TZOHAR 

When the world was first created, God filled the world with a sacred light, known as the 
primordial light. This was the light that came into being when God said , " Let there be light" 
(Gen. 1:3). It was not the light of the sun, for that did not come into being until the fourth 
day, when God created the sun and the moon and the stars. It was a miraculous light by 
which it was possible for Adam to see from one end of the world to the other. 

When Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, the first thing they lost was that precious 
light. Without it, the world seemed dark to them, for the sun shone like a candle in com- 
parison. But God preserved one small part of that precious light inside a glowing stone, 
and the angel Raziel delivered this stone to Adam after they had been expelled from the 
Garden of Eden, as a token of the world they had left behind. This jewel, known as the 
Tzohar, sometimes glowed brightly and sometimes was dim. 

As he lay on his deathbed, Adam gave the jewel to his son Seth, who passed it down to the 
righteous Enoch. Enoch grew in wisdom until he was taken into Paradise in a chariot, and 
transformed into the angel Metatron, the heavenly scribe and Prince of the treasuries of heaven. 

Before departing this world, Enoch gave the Tzohar to his son, Methuselah. Methuselah 
slept in its glowing light, and some say that is why he lived longer than anyone else. 
Methuselah passed on the jewel to his son Lamech, who gave it to his son, Noah, who 
brought it with him on the ark. Indeed, God instructed Noah to do so when he said, " Put 
the Tzohar in the ark" (Gen. 6:16). Noah hung it on the deck, and for forty days and nights 
it illumined the ark. Noah determined whether it was day or night by gauging the bril- 
liance of the stone. It was dim during the day, but it shone brightly at night. 

When the ark landed on Mount Ararat, the first thing Noah did was to plant grapes, 
and when they grew ripe, he made wine and became drunk, and at that moment the 
Tzohar fell from where it had been hung in the ark, rolled into the water, and sank to the 
bottom of the sea. There it was carried by the currents until it came to rest in an under- 
water cave. 

Years later, after the waters had subsided, the child Abraham was bom in that cave. 
His mother had gone there to give birth, to escape King Nimrod's decree that all new- 
born boys be put to death. For Nimrod had seen a sign that a child bom at that time 
would overthrow him. After giving birth, Abraham's mother grew afraid for the safety of 



86 MYTHS OF CREATION 


her family, and at last she abandoned the infant in the cave and returned home. Then the 
angel Gabriel descended to the cave and fed the infant with his thumb, through which 
milk and honey flowed, and because he was fed in that miraculous way, the boy began to 
grow at the rate of a year every day. And on the third day, while exploring the cave, he 
found a stone glowing in one of the crevices of the cave. Then the angel, who knew how 
precious it was, put it on a chain, and hung it around Abraham's neck. 

Thirteen days later Abraham's mother returned to the cave, for she could not put the 
fate of the infant out of her mind. She expected to find that the child was no longer living, 
but instead she found a grown boy, who said that he was her child. She refused to believe 
it at first, but when he showed her the glowing stone and the sacred light it cast, she cam e 
to believe that a miracle had taken place. 

Abraham wore that glowing jewel all the days of his life. Whoever was ill and looked 
into that stone soon healed, and it also served as an astrolabe to study the stars. Before his 
death, Abraham gave that glowing jewel to Isaac, and Isaac gave it to Jacob at the time he 
gave him the stolen blessing. For Isaac had intended to give the glowing stone to Esau, 
but Rebecca, who was a seer, knew well that it was destined to belong to Jacob. 

Jacob was wearing the Tzohar when he dreamed of the ladder reaching to heaven, with 
angels ascending and descending on it. And he, in turn, gave the stone to his beloved 
son, Joseph, when he gave him the coat of many colors. 

Jacob made Joseph promise to wear the stone at all times, but he did not reveal its 
power, which he knew well. And because Joseph's brothers did not know that the amulet 
was precious, they did not take it from him when they stripped him of the coat of many 
colors and cast him naked into the dark pit. 

Now snakes and scorpions lived at the bottom of that pit. And when Joseph heard 
them slithering and creeping in the dry leaves, he shivered in the darkness at the bottom 
of the pit. All at once a light began to glow, and Joseph saw that it was coming from the 
amulet he wore around his neck. And as long as Joseph remained in that pit, the jewel 
continued to glow, so that he was never afraid. At last Joseph heard Midianite traders 
calling out to him from the top of that pit. They pulled him out of the pit and brought him 
to Egypt, where they sold him into slavery and to the destiny that fate held for him, 
which was to become Prince of Egypt. 

When Joseph was imprisoned in the dungeon, he discovered that if he placed the 
Tzohar inside his cup and peered into it, he could read the future and interpret dreams. 
That is how he interpreted the dreams of the butler and baker, and later the dreams of 
Pharaoh that prophesied the seven years of famine. It was that same cup that Joseph hid 
in the saddlebags of Benjamin, about which his servant said, "It is the very one from which 
my master drinks and which he uses for divination" (Gen. 44:5). 

That cup, with the precious jewel in it, was placed inside Joseph's coffin at the time of 
his death, and it remained there until Moses recovered Joseph's coffin and was told in a 
dream to take out the glowing stone and hang it in the Tabernacle, where it became known 
as the Ner Tamid, the Eternal Light. And that is why, even to this day, an Eternal Light 
bums above every Ark of the Torah in every synagogue. 


This tale is a classic example of a chain midrash — a series of midrashim that are 
linked to each other by a common object or character. The object here is the glowing 
stone known as the Tzohar. This myth builds on that of the primordial light that God 
brought into being on the first day of Creation. See "The Light of the First Day," p. 83. 

The word "Tzohar" only appears once in the Torah, when God instructs Noah on 
how to build the ark and tells him "Put the Tzohar in the ark" (Gen. 6:16). For this 
reason there is uncertainty about its meaning. Rashi's comments on Genesis 6:16 ob- 
serve that some say the Tzohar was a window (or an opening, a skylight, or a dome — 



THE PRIMORDIAL LKkHT 87 


implying that it should admit light into the ark) and others say that it was a precious 
stone. Virtually all other midrashim adopt the view that it was some kind of precious 
stone. Targum Yonathan paraphrases Genesis 6:16 to read, "Go to the river Pishon and 
take a brilliant stone from there and place it into the ark, to illuminate it for you." 
Midrash Aggadah states that God commanded Noah to bring a diamond with him on 
the ark, to give them light, for the world will have grown dark. "Tzohar" is probably 
linked to tzoharayim, the Hebrew word for "noon." The sound of the word is sugges- 
tive of z ohar, which means "splendor" or "illumination," and is the title of the central 
text of Jewish mysticism. What seems clear is that it indicated some kind of light, 
whether shining through a window or reflected from a glowing jewel. The need for a 
jewel arises because of the likelihood that dark clouds covered the world during the 
days and nights of the Flood, and therefore no light would shine through a window. 
This follows the tradition that during the time of die Flood, day and night were indis- 
tinguishable ( Genesis Kabbah 25:2, 34:11; Rashi on Genesis 8:22). Not only did darkness 
cover the earth during the 40 days and nights of the Flood, but the planets ceased to 
function. How is this known? Because at the time of the covenant of the rainbow, God 
promised Noah, "So long as earth exists ... day and night shall not cease" (Gen. 8:22). 
From this it can be deduced that day and night were indistinguishable for the dura- 
tion of the Flood, and that the heavenly bodies ceased to function. 

The legend of the glowing gem that Noah hung in the ark is found in Genesis Rabbah 
31:11: "During the whole 12 months that Noah was in the ark he did not require the 
light of the sun by day or the light of the moon by night, but he had a polished gem 
which he hung up: when it was dim he knew that it was day, and when it shone he 
knew that it was night." Noah used this information to know when to feed the ani- 
mals at their customary times. This jewel is linked to the myth that God gave a jewel 
to Adam and Eve at the time they were cast out of the Garden of Eden, to remind them 
of all they had lost. The midrash then links this jewel to the genealogy between Adam 
and Noah, as well as that beginning with Abraham and the subsequent generations, 
until the time of the Temple. 

The story of the precious stone of Abraham is found in B. Bava Batra 16b. This 
account offers an alternate fate for the precious stone, saying, "When Abraham passed 
away from the world, the Holy One, blessed be He, hung it on the wheel of the sun." 
The legend about Joseph in the pit is found in Midrash Aseret Harugei Malkhut. The 
story of Joseph's cup being carried off by his brothers is found in Genesis 44:5. The 
Ner Tamid or Eternal Light is first mentioned in Exodus 27:20: You shall further instruct 
the Israelites to bring you clear oil of beaten olives for lighting, for kindling lamps regularly. 
Every Jewish synagogue contains such a light which is kept lit at all times. 

This myth evolves out of an attempt to resolve two problems in the biblical text: 
the nature of the light of the first day of Creation, before the creation of the sun and 
moon and stars, and the meaning of Tzohar in the passage about building the ark. The 
midrash explains that the light of the first day was a sacred light, which, according to 
some accounts, was cast from God's garment of light, and, according to others, was 
reflected from the robe of the Shekhinah . See "The Light of the First Day," p. 83. The 
vehicle of the chain midrash makes it possible for it to be transmitted from Adam to 
Noah, and then from Noah to Abraham and the other patriarchs. 

In Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer, 10, a Tzohar ~\ike pearl is described as having been sus- 
pended in the belly of the whale, where it was said to have shone as brightly as the 
sun at noon. It showed Jonah all that was in the sea and in the depths. 

According to the Zohar, Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai also had possession of the Tzohar : 
"Our companion. Bar Yohai, has a jewel, a precious stone, and I have looked upon the 
light emitted by it, and it is like die light of the sun, illuminating the whole world. 
This light extends from the heavens to the earth, and will continue to illumine the 
world until the Ancient of Days comes, and sits upon His throne" ( Zohar l:lla-llb). 
The Tzohar also appears in various Jewish folk and Hasidic tales, usually in the form 



88 MYTHS OF CREATION 


of a glowing jewel found in some accidental way. See "The Soul of the Avi," about an egg- 
shaped glowing jewel, in Gabriel’s Palace, p. 258. It is possible that J. R. R. Tolkien made use 
of some of the legends about the Tzohar in The Silmarillion, in which the central motif 
concerns jewels containing the last of a primordial light.

110. HOW LIGHT AND DARKNESS WERE CREATED 

Before any visible beings came into existence, there were only invisible beings. Then God 
decided to create a visible creation. So God said, "Let one of the invisible things descend 
and become visible." And Adoil, one of the invisible things, descended. He was extremely 
large, and in his belly he had a great light. God said to Adoil, "Disintegrate yourself, 
Adoil, and let what is bom from you become visible." And Adoil disintegrated himself, 
and out came a very great light. And God was in the midst of the light, and a light came 
forth out of that light and revealed all the creation that God had thought to create. And 
God saw that it was good. And God placed a throne for himself, and sat down on it. And 
then God spoke to the light and said, "You rise up and become the foundation for the 
highest things. For there is nothing higher than light, except for nothingness itself." 

And God summoned the very lowest beings for a second time, and said, "Let one of 
the invisible beings descend and become visible." And Arkhas came out, solid and heavy 
and very red. And God said to Arkhas, open yourself up, Arkhas, and let what is bom 
from you become visible." And Arkhas disintegrated himself, and a great darkness 
emerged from him, very large, bearing the creation of all lower things. And God saw 
how good it was. And God said to the darkness, "Descend and become the foundation of 
all lower things. For there is nothing lower than the darkness, except nothing itself." 

Then God took some light and some darkness and mixed them together, and commanded 
them to thicken, and when they did. He wrapped them with light, and spread it out, and it 
became water. And God spread it out above the darkness and below the light, dividing the 
world above from the world below. And God made a foundation of light around the wa- 
ters, with seven circles inside it, with the appearance of crystal. And he pointed out the 
route of each one of the seven stars to its own heaven. And God made a division between 
the light and the darkness, and said to the light that it should be day, and to darkness that 
it should be night. And there was evening and there was morning, a first day (Gen. 1:5). 

This astonishing creation myth from 2 Enoch dates from around the second century 
bce to the first century ce. It portrays a version of the creation of light and darkness 
that is radically different from that found in Genesis. Here the earliest manifestation 
of existence occurs when God commands two invisible beings, Adoil and Arkhas, to 
give birth to light and darkness, which come to serve as the upper and lower founda- 
tions of the world. Adoil and Arkhas are primordial beings — not angels or gods, but 
invisible forces entirely under God's command. And it is God who commands that 
they descend and become visible. Of particular interest is God's command to Adoil 
and Arkhas that they disintegrate themselves, suggesting that their disintegration 
makes possible the subsequent births that take place. When they do, a great light 
comes forth from Adoil, while Arkhas gives birth to darkness. This myth is an inter- 
esting parallel to that of the Ari about the Shattering of the Vessels. In both cases a 
kind of breaking apart is required before anything can be created. See "The Shattering 
of the Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks/' p. 122. 



THE PRIMORDIAL LICHT 89 


This myth about Adoil and Arkhas also has distinctly Gnostic overtones, for it 
suggests that God did not create light and darkness by Himself. Instead, God com- 
manded that certain invisible beings give birth to these forces, and that is what took 
place. There is no explanation given for the existence of the invisible beings, no state- 
ment that God created them. Further, it is stated that God coexisted with them and 
moved around with them. But God's command over them is demonstrated when He 
orders them to manifest themselves and then to disintegrate themselves, so that light 
and darkness can be created. Thus this myth suggests that, for God, the primary work 
of Creation was in making the invisible visible. 

The very strangeness of this myth seems to hint at an even more ancient Jewish 
mythology where elemental forces were personified as primitive beings rather than 
as spiritual beings such as angels. Or it might be that this myth was influenced by 
Egyptian and Iranian mythologies. 

The end of this myth dovetails into Genesis 1:5: And there was evening and there was 
morning , a first day. Thus this myth explicitly offers itself as an alternative to the cre- 
ation myth found in Genesis 1:1-4, where light is created and darkness already seems 
to exist. It is a much more complex— and mythical— kind of creation than God simply 
saying " Let there be light/' and there was light (Gen. 1:3).

111. CREATION BY LIGHT 

In His wondrous hidden way, God contracted His light again and again until physical 
bodies were created. Thus God's kingdom has dominion over all, for all the world is but 
an emanation of His light. 

Here Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira reinterprets the kabbalistic concept of 
tzimtzum so that it refers not to God's contraction of Himself, but to God's contraction 
of light, and through this process the physical word is made manifest. This is also a 
sefirotic myth, in which each subsequent contraction of God leads to the next sefirah. 

Thus two primary kabbalistic concepts stand behind this brief yet original myth cre- 
ated by Rabbi Shapira, a twentieth century rabbi who perished in the Warsaw Ghetto. 

The existence of this myth is evidence of the continued myth-making process in Juda- 
ism into our own time.

112. THE LIGHT OF PROPHECY 

The light and holiness that are present in every Jew find their source in the heights of the 
supernal world. It is like wine poured into a flask with a funnel. Only the narrow end of the 
funnel enters the flask. In this way the light from above diminishes and contracts until it 
takes the form of the spirit that inspired the prophets. It is then diminished further until all 
that remains in the present generation is a small spark of prophecy. 

A rabbinic principle holds that the spirit of prophecy available to the patriarchs was 
greatly reduced in the time of the prophets, and subsequently was reduced still fur- 
ther, until it is said that a dream is one sixtieth of prophecy. This follows the general 



90 MYTHS OF CREATION 


belief that the true giants of humanity existed in the distant past, and our generation is 
removed from the true sources of prophetic inspiration. See "The Holy Spirit," p. 18.

113. GOD'S SHOUT 

On the first day God brought fire and water, mixed them together, and made the heavens 
from them. But the heavens remained in a fluid state and did not solidify until the second 
day, when God shouted, " Let there be a firmament!" (Gen. 1:6). Then the pillars of heaven 
trembled; they were awe-struck by His divine shout (Job 26:11), and after that they re- 
mained fixed in one place. 

This midrash attempts to explain why God created the heavens on the first day 
(Gen. 1:1), but He did not create the firmament until the second day (Gen. 1:7). Al- 
though the only description in Genesis about God's voice states that "God said," (Gen. 

1:3), this myth goes beyond the text of Genesis by insisting that God's voice was a 
shout, and the power of this shout was so great that the pillars of heaven solidified 
and ever since have remained firmly in place. The use of "shout," even more than 
"said," suggests a powerful personification of God. It also suggests a strong parallel 
with Greek and Canaanite gods, who also display similar human characteristics.

114. THE WORK OF CREATION 

How did God create the heavens? He took fire and water and beat them together, and 
from them the heavens were made. 

How did God create the earth? Some say He took two balls, one of fire, the other of 
snow, kneaded them together, and worked them into one. Others say there were four 
balls, one for each of the four comers of the world. Still others insist there were six balls, 
one for each of the four comers and one for above and one for below. 

It is also said that God took two elements, chaos and void, and combined them to- 
gether. For they were the elements out of which darkness and water were created, and 
from darkness and water the world was brought into being. 

Still others say that when God decided to create the world. He brought a single spark 
out of the primal darkness, and blew upon it, until it was kindled. And He brought out of 
the recesses of the deep a single drop, and He joined them together, and with them He 
created the world. 

Creation by elements is a common theme in rabbinic sources. Sometimes these 
elements are said to have preceded Creation, as in this case, where they are identified 
as tohu and vohu, chaos and void. Other legends suggest that the world was created 
out of water, wind, and fire: "Three creations preceded the creation of this world: 
water, wind, and fire. Water conceived and gave birth to thick darkness. Fire con- 
ceived and gave birth to light. Wind conceived and gave birth to wisdom. Thus is the 
world maintained by these six creations: by wind and darkness, by fire and light, by 
water and wisdom" ( Exodus Rabbah 15:22). However, Genesis Rabbah 1:9 reminds us 
that these primeval elements were created by God, and were not eternal: "A certain 
philosopher said to Rabbi Gamaliel: 'Your God was indeed a great artist, but He found 
good materials which assisted Him.' 'What are they?' Rabbi Gamaliel asked. 'Tohu, 



THE WORK OF CREATION 91 


vohu, darkness, water, wind and the deep/ At this Rabbi Gamaliel exclaimed: 'Woe to 
that man!"' Note that all six elements are mentioned in Psalm 104. 

There are similar Greek creation myths found in Hesiod's Theogony 211-32, in which 
there is a union between darkness and chaos. What is missing in these myths is God's 
role in combining these elements to create the world.

115. HOW THE HEAVENS WERE CREATED 

How were the heavens created? With the brilliance of God's covering, which God took 
up and spread like a garment, as it is said. He spread them out as a tent for dwelling therein. 
Then the heavens went on expanding until God told them to stop. So too did God bless 
each of the four corners of the heavens. From the east the light of the world goes forth, 
and from the south the dew of blessings descends upon the land. From the west come the 
stores of snow and hail, heat and cold, while the rain that falls for the benefit of the land 
comes from the north. 

Tractate Hagigah of the Talmud describes the world expanding like a roll of thread 
or rope at the beginning of Creation, until God rebuked it and brought it to a stand- 
still. This interpretation is based on the verse The pillars of heaven were trembling , but 
they became astonished at His rebuke (Job 26:11). There is a similar myth about God re- 
buking the sea when it was created and causing it to dry up. This derives from the 
verse He rebukes the sea and dries it up (Nah. 1:4). See "The Rebellion of the Waters," p. 

105. See also "God's Shout," p. 90, where God delivers a similar rebuke, which causes 
the pillars of heaven to harden, holding up the firmament.

116. THE EARTH'S FOUNDATIONS 

Then Yahweh replied to Job out of the tempest and said, "Where were you when I laid the 
earth's foundations? Speak if you have understanding. Do you know who fixed its dimen- 
sions or who measured it with a line? Onto what were its bases sunk? Who set its corner- 
stone when the morning stars sang together and all the divine beings shouted for joy?" 

God's reply to Job challenges Job's right to question any of God's ways by pointing out 
that, as the Creator of the world. He does not owe Job any answers. Here God describes 
creating the world the way people build a house, laying the foundation, marking off its 
dimensions, and laying the cornerstone. While God's intention may be rhetorical, the 
effect is a vivid mythic description of God laying the foundations of the earth.

Job 38:1, 38:4-7. 


117. CREATION BY GOD'S NAME 

It is a wonderful and strange and great secret that the Name by which heaven and earth 
were created was God's Name. For that Name was the instrument through which the 



92 MYTHS OF CREATION 


world was brought into being, as it is said, By the word ofYahweh were the heavens made (Ps. 
33:6). All the categories of creation were swallowed up and bound together and sus- 
pended and sealed, and God saw that this was good (Gen. 1:12). 

Some say that the generations of heaven and earth were created by the letter heh , which 
appears twice in God's Name. Others say that God used the first two letters of his Name, 
yod and he, to create the world. But most say that God used all four letters of His Name 
when He began to create heaven and earth. 

The powers attributed to the four-letter Name of God are limitless. The Maharal was 
said to have pronounced the Name in order to bring the Golem of Prague, a man made 
out of clay, to life. Rabbi Judah the Pious used the Name to bring a dead man to life, in 
order to testify as to who had killed him. This myth asserts that God's Name — YHVH — 
was the instrument by which the world was created. Further, the role of the individual 
letters of the Name is debated, and whether or not all four of them took part in Creation. 

See "The God of Our Fathers," p. 25 and "The Tetragrammaton," p. 27 for a further 
discussion of the Tetragrammaton.

118. CREATION BY GOD'S BEAUTY 

The world was created by God's beauty: the deeps were set ablaze by His beauty, the 
firmaments were kindled by His radiance. The angels burst out of His stature, the mighty 
exploded from His crown, and the precious erupted from His garment. And all of the 
trees and grasses came forth exulting from His joy. 

This myth is found in a hymn from Hekhalot Rabbati , also known as the "Greater 
Hekhalot/' one of the primary Hekhalot texts describing heavenly journeys. In this un- 
usual myth, creation is described as having been kindled by God's beauty. Other myths 
portray God in an active manner, either speaking, as in Genesis, or shouting, or smash- 
ing elements together with His hands. But here it is God's attribute of beauty that is 
identified as the creative element that gives birth to the creation of the world. 

Later in this hymn God is described as a cosmic tree, "who covered the heavens 
with His glorious bough, and appeared from the heights in His majesty."

119. THE PALACE OF HEAVEN 

God built the upper rooms of the palace first, for having spread a roof He built the top 
story, which He suspended on nothingness above the world's atmosphere. After that He 
made the clouds into His chariots and colonnades out of the whirlwind. He built the 
upper chambers with balconies of water, and He built the top stories not with stone or 
hewn blocks, but with walls of compressed water. God then created windows in the 
firmament, in the east and in the west. Some of these windows were created to serve the 
sun and some for the moon. There are also eleven windows that the moon does not enter. 

Here God's palace is portrayed as not only being in the heavens, but being the very 
heavens themselves. Thus in creating the heavens, God created His own palace. This 
passage is based on Psalm 104:3: He sets the rafters of His lofts in the waters , makes the 
clouds His chariot , moves on the wings of the wind. The image also echoes Isaiah 40:22, It 
is He who is enthroned above the vault of the earth. 



THE COSMIC SEED 93 


Midrash Tanhuma-Yelammedenu, Bereshit 4 contrasts man's method of building a 
palace with that of God: "A man first constructs the foundations of a palace and then 
erects the upper story upon it, but God fashioned the upper spheres first and then 
created the earthly spheres: In the beginning God created the heavens , and afterward: and 
the earth (Gen. 1:1). The 11 windows that the moon does not enter refer to the 11 days 
by which the solar year exceeds the lunar year. Genesis Rabbah 1:15 recounts a rabbinic 
discussion about which was created first, heaven or earth. See p. 247.

120. CREATION ACCORDING TO PHILO 

God is eternally creating the world. Indeed, there never was a time when God was not 
creating it. Ever since the beginning, God's thoughts of Creation were with Him. For God 
is always thinking and always creating. Without a counselor— for who else was there?— 
and making use of His own powers, God's will created this visible world. God used His 
Logos as an instrument with which to divide the formless expanse to create the world. 

Even if the world is now immortal through the providence of God, there was a time when 
it was not. But God, of course, is eternally existent, always has existed, and always will. 

Here Philo presents his theory that God did not stop after creating the world, but 
has continued to create it ever since. This engages the theological question of what 
God's actions have been since He completed the creation of the world. In Philo's view 
the work of Creation is an ongoing process. See "Re-creating the World," p. 292. 
"Logos," as Philo uses the term, is an intermediary between God and the world.

121. THE COSMIC SEED 

In the beginning a holy spark emerged from within the hidden depths of God, concealed 
within the mystery of the Infinite. As the spark began to glow, radiant colors were re- 
vealed. That spark was a cosmic seed, planted in the innermost recesses of the divine 
womb. There it was hidden away within a palace of its own creation, the way a silkworm 
hides itself in a palace of its own. It was there, in that palace, that the holy seed was sown, 
from which all of existence came forth. Before that spark nothing is known. That is why 
it is called the Beginning. 

This is the key kabbalistic creation myth in the Zohar, found near the beginning of the 
book. It is both a mystical commentary on Genesis 1:1 and a creation myth of its own, as 
well as the primary myth describing the process of emanation of the ten sefirot. As a 
creation myth, it draws on the cosmic egg type of myth, in this case creation from a cosmic 
seed that takes root in the primordial womb. Unstated, but suggested, is the mythic im- 
age of a divine womb, and the hint of a goddess figure who gives birth to the world. 

At the same time, this myth functions in the Zohar as an alternate creation myth, 
that of creation by emanation, as performed through the ten sefirot. It proposes that 



94 MYTHS OF CREATION 


the world emanated from the highest, unknowable part of God known as Ein Sof, the 
Endless, in a series of emanations, each identified with one of the ten sefirot. The 
language of the Zohar in presenting this myth is extremely allusive, symbolic, and 
cloaked in mystery. 

It is possible to see this myth as a key influence in the famous myth of the Ari of 
" The Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks," which draws on the 
central image of the spark. Indeed, the Ari's myth can be viewed as an imaginative 
retelling of the myth of the cosmic seed. 

In "Kabbalah and Myth," Gershom Scholem comments about this myth: "It is the 
world seed . . . which is sown in the primordial womb of the "supernal' mother. . . . 
Fertilized in this womb, the world seed through her emanates the other seven poten- 
cies, which the kabbalists interpret as the archetypes of all Creation, but also as the 
seven 'first days' of the first chapter of Genesis, or in other words as the original 
stages of intradivine development."

122. A UNIVERSE OF WATER 

At first there was only a universe of water. God then took snow from beneath His Throne 
of Glory and cast it upon the waters, and the waters froze and became the dust of the 
earth, and God blessed it, so that it became fruitful and multiplied. Thus the earth stands 
upon the waters. The waters stand upon pillars of mountains. The pillars of mountains 
stand upon the wind. The wind stands upon the whirlwind, and God made the whirl- 
wind like an amulet hung from His arm. 

This myth explains how land was created when the whole earth was covered with 
water. An alternate explanation in Pesikta Rabbati 48:2 states that "Primeval waters 
covered the whole world. What did God do? Some say He emptied them into that 
which was already full. Others say He pressed down upon them, so to speak, and 
made them gather into one great sea." This, then, is a divine miracle, in which God 
pours water into water that was already full, and it does not overflow. 

A later text in Midrash Konen greatly elaborates on the chain of images in this text: 

"The earth is stretched out upon the waters, and the waters on pillars of hashmal, and 
the pillars of hashmal on the Mountain of Hailstones, and the Mountain of Hailstones 
on the Storehouses of Snow, and the Storehouses of Snow on the Storehouses of Water 
and Fire, and the Storehouses of Water on the sea, and the sea on the deep ( tehom ), and 
the deep on chaos ( tohu ), and chaos on the void (vohu), and the void stands upon the 
sea, and the sea stands on the sweet waters, and the sweet waters stand on the moun- 
tains, and the mountains stand on the wind, and the wind on the wings of storm, and 
the storm is tied to the heavens, and the heavens are suspended from the arm of the 
Holy One, blessed be He." 

In Merkavah Rabbah, it is not just the whirlwind that hangs like an amulet from 
God's arm, but the universe itself, based on the verse. And beneath His arm — the uni- 
verse (Deut. 33:27). 

The transformation of snow into water is linked with Job 37:6, For He says to the 
snow, " Become earth," while the ending echoes the biblical phrase. The arm of Yahweh 
has been revealed (Isa. 53:1).

THE &lt;OSMI&lt; SEED 95 


123. THE THREE CRAFTSMEN 

When God first created the world, everything consisted of water, and from water God 
developed the world. He made three craftsmen to do His work — heaven, earth, and wa- 
ter. With these. He created everything in this world. He directed each of the three crafts- 
men to produce the creations necessary for the world. He bid water produce earth, 
commanding the waters to gather in one place. The waters did as they were commanded 
and that is when dry land appeared, as it is said, " Let the water below the sky be gathered into 
one area, that the dry land may appear'" (Gen. 1:9). 

Then God called upon the earth to produce its creations — animals and other living 
creatures. And the earth did as it was commanded, as it is said, " Let the earth bring forth 
every kind of living creature" (Gen. 1:24). So too did God call upon the earth to produce 
vegetation and plants. And the earth did so, as it is said, " Let the earth sprout vegetation: 
seed-bearing plants, fruit trees of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in it" (Gen. 
1:11). And God called upon the waters to produce swarms of fish and birds, as it is said, 
" Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and birds that fly above the earth across the 
expanse of the sky" (Gen. 1:20). 

God then called upon the heavens to make a separation between the upper waters and 
the lower waters, as it is said, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it 
divide the waters from the waters" (Gen. 1:6), and it was done. Then God called upon the 
heavens to illuminate the earth, as it is said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the 
heavens" (Gen. 1:14), and this, too, was accomplished. 

But when it was time to create man, God said, "None of you is able to produce this 
creature alone. All of you must unite, and I too will join you. Together we shall make 
man." So God joined with the three craftsmen in creating man, and God gave him a soul. 

This myth embellishes the Genesis creation myth, personifying heaven, earth, and 
water, and attributing the creations of the earth to them, acting at God's command. 

Thus God delegates His powers to these personified forces, and the actual work of 
Creation comes from them, instead of from the word of God. This indicates a 
remythologizing process, moving away from the abstraction of creation by the word 
toward creation by primordial forces. 

One of the primary rabbinic debates about Creation centers on whether or not God 
had any assistance. Just as the angels are said to have assisted God in some roles of 
Creation, the elements are personified as celestial entities, virtually as lesser gods, 
who were created to carry out God's orders. But in doing so they play an active role in 
the work of Creation. This detracts from the stunning totality of God's accomplish- 
ment. In other myths, God does not depend on assistance from other celestial beings 
or on the existence of some kind of pre-existent elements, such as darkness and light, 
water, earth, and heaven. In De Somniis 1:76, Philo identifies both kinds of elements: 
"When God gave birth to all things. He not only brought them into sight, but also 
brought into being things that had not existed before. Thus He was not merely an 
artificer, but also a Creator." 

Further, God joins in with the three other elements to create man— God contributes 
the soul. Even though this is the most important part, it is still only one part out of four. 

Thus from a theological point of view, it appears that this myth from Midrash ha-Ne'elam 
takes the point of view that God did have assistance in creating the world, but that God 
Himself first created those assistants, the elements, to serve that very purpose. This 
mitigates the pagan aspect of this myth.

96 MYTHS OF CREATION 


124. THE PILLARS OF THE WORLD 

The world stands upon pillars. Some say it stands on twelve pillars, according to the 
number of the tribes of Israel. Others say that it rests on seven pillars, which stand on the 
water. This water is on top of the mountains, which rest on wind and storm. Still others 
say that the world stands on three pillars. Once every three hundred years they move 
slightly, causing earthquakes. But Rabbi Eleazar ben Shammua says that it rests on one 
pillar, whose name is "Righteous." 

One of the ancient creation myths found in many cultures describes the earth as 
standing on one or more pillars. In this Jewish version of the myth, several theories 
are found — that the earth stands on twelve, seven, or three pillars — or on one. Rabbi 
Eleazar ben Shammua gives that one pillar the name of Tzaddik, "Righteous," under- 
scoring an allegorical reading of this myth, whereby God is the pillar that supports 
the world. This, of course, is the central premise of monotheism. Alternatively, his 
comment may be understood to refer to the Tzaddik, the righteous man whose exist- 
ence is required for the world to continue to exist. Or it might refer to the principle of 
righteousness, and how the world could not exist without it.

125. THE FOUNDATION STONE 

The world has a foundation stone. This stone serves as the starting point for all that was 
created, and serves as a true foundation. 

How did it come to exist? In the beginning, when God desired to create the world. He 
took snow from beneath the Throne of Glory and cast it into the waters, where it con- 
gealed into a stone in the midst of the Deep. This is the center of the universe, and from 
it the earth expanded in all directions. God began the creation of His world at that foun- 
dation stone, and built the world upon it. 

Others say that God took a stone compounded of fire, water, and air, and cast it into 
the abyss so that it held fast there, holding back the waters of the deep, and the world 
was planted in that place. Then there are those who say that God took the Foundation 
Stone and hurled it to the place designated for the Temple, and raised His right foot and 
drove the stone down into the very bottom of the deep and made it the pillar of the earth 
and founded the world upon it. 

Still others say that God took an emerald stone engraved with mysteries of the alpha- 
bet, and threw it into the waters. It drifted from place to place until it came to the Holy 
Land, and there it sank, and the whole world was firmly established on it. And that is 
why it is called Even ha-Shetiyyah, the Foundation Stone. 

When King David decided to build the Temple in Jerusalem, he commanded that shafts 
be dug to a depth of fifteen hundred cubits. And lo, they struck a stone in one of those 
shafts. As soon as he learned of it. King David went there with Ahitophel, his counselor, 
and with other members of the court. They descended into the pit, and there, at the bot- 
tom, they saw the immense stone, shining like the darkest emerald. 

All those who saw it were amazed, and they knew that it must, indeed, be that fabled 
stone, which served as the world's foundation. Yet all at once King David was possessed 
by a great curiosity to see what lay beneath it. King David ordered it to be raised, but a 
voice came forth from the stone, saying: "Be warned that I must not be lifted. I serve to 
hold back the waters of the Abyss." 



THE COSMIC SEED 97 


All of them stood in awe of that voice, but King David's curiosity was still not sated. 
He decided to ignore the warning, and once more he ordered the stone to be raised. None 
of his advisors dared say anything, for they feared his wrath. After a great effort, a comer 
of the Foundation Stone was lifted up, and King David bent down and peered into the 
Abyss beneath it. There he heard something like the sound of rushing waters, and he 
suddenly realized that by lifting the stone he had set free the waters of the Deep. Once 
again the world was in danger of being deluged, as in the time of Noah. 

King David trembled with fear, and he asked the others what they might do to cause the 
waters to fall back, but no one spoke. Then King David said: "Perhaps if I wrote the Name 
of God on a potsherd, and cast it into the depths, we might still be saved. But does anyone 
know if this is permitted?" Still the others said nothing, and King David grew angry and 
said: "If any one of you knows this and still refuses to answer, then your soul will bear the 
curse of the end of existence!" Then Ahitophel spoke: "Surely the Name can be used to 
bring peace to the whole world." So David picked up a potsherd and scratched the four- 
letter Name of God into it, and cast it into the bottomless pit. All at once the roar of the 
waters grew fainter, and they knew that they had been saved by the power of the Name. 

In the days to come King David repented many times for his sin, and he gave thanks to 
God for sparing the world from another Flood. And his son, Solomon, had the Holy of 
Holies of the Temple built exactly above the Foundation Stone, for both the stone and the 
Temple bore the seal of God's blessing. 

Others say that after King David found the stone resting on the mouth of the abyss, 
with God's Name on it, he put the stone into the Holy of Holies of the Temple. The sages 
were concerned that some young men might leam the true pronunciation of the Divine 
Name from the speaking stone, and thereby destroy the world. So they built two lions of 
brass, which they placed by the Holy of Holies, on the right and left. If anyone entered 
and learned the divine Name, these lions would roar when he came out, so frightening 
him that he would forget the Name. Further, a divine blessing was said to emanate from 
the Foundation Stone, which was bestowed upon Israel from the Holy of Holies. Some 
say that this blessing came from the wings of the angels and cherubim that hovered 
above the Foundation Stone, and that the stars and planets joined the blessing as well. 
But when the Temple was destroyed, the blessing was lost. 

Others say that the angels above and Israel below all hold fast to the Foundation Stone, 
which rises up to heaven, and comes to rest among the righteous. And if that stone, 
which hovers in the air, should fall to the earth, it would be a sign that that the days of the 
Messiah were at hand. 

A myth in Y. Sanhedrin 29a asserts that God used a shard to hold back the waters in 
exactly the same way that King David did: "God prevented tehom (the lower waters) 
from rising up by placing a shard above the waters, on which He had engraved His 
Name. The seal was removed only once, in the time of Noah. Then tehom united with 
the upper waters, and together they flooded the earth." In Sefer ha-Zikhronot 1:6, a 
clearly related midrash reports that the earth was created from the snow beneath the 
Throne of Glory. God took it up and scattered it upon the waters. Then the water 
congealed and became the dust of the earth. This is linked to the verse For he says to the 
snow , " Become earth" (Job 37:6). 

This talmudic legend about King David demonstrates the immense sanctity of 
Jerusalem, and especially of the site of the Temple there. King David sets out to dig 
the foundations of the Temple, and strikes the Foundation Stone of the earth, upon 
which God built the rest of this world. This confirms that Jerusalem is the very center 
of the world, as it was portrayed in ancient maps. 

At the same time, this tale is a divine test, not unlike the tests of Adam and Eve, of 
Abraham in the Akedah, the binding of Isaac, and of Job. Even though a voice from the 



98 MYTHS OF CREATION 


stone warns him not to lift it. King David, not unlike Pandora, lifts the Foundation 
Stone and sets free the powers of chaos, the waters of the Abyss, which threaten to 
inundate the earth as in the time of Noah. In a desperate moment, David writes the 
Tetragrammaton, the secret Name of God, on a shard and throws it into the abyss, and 
the power of God's Name causes the waters to retreat. (Note the echo to nuclear war 
in this episode. David learns that the Foundation Stone must not be tampered with, as 
we have learned the dangers posed by tampering with the atom.) 

The Zohar (2:91b) states that the fate of the shard, and therefore the world, rests on 
man's moral conduct. Whenever a person swears falsely using God's Name, that Name 
on the shard disappears, allowing the waters to burst out and destroy the world. To 
protect the shard and all of humanity, God has appointed the angel Yazriel over the 
shard. The angel has 70 graving tools, which he uses to ensure that the letters of God's 
Name are replaced on the shard as quickly as they are erased, saving the world. Thus 
the rising of the waters of the abyss is a continual threat to the existence of the world. 

1 Enoch 66:1-2 offers an alternate explanation of how the waters of the abyss are 
held back: "And after that he showed me the angels of punishment who are prepared 
to let loose all the powers of the waters beneath the earth in order to bring judgment 
and destruction to all those who dwell on the earth. And God commanded those an- 
gels to hold those waters in check, for those angels held power over those waters." 

In the alternate version of the myth. King David brings the Foundation Stone into 
the Temple (despite the fact that it had not yet been built— this was done by Solomon). 
Still another variant of the myth describes the stone ascending to Paradise, resting 
among the righteous. In yet other versions, it is described as hovering in the air. In 
fact, the motif of a sacred object hovering in the air between heaven and earth is quite 
common. There are versions found among the Samaritans — where a stone is described 
as being suspended in the air for worship, and among both Jews and Arabs — where 
the Rock is said to hover in the air inside the Dome of the Rock. In another Arabic 
myth, the object that is hovering is the grave of Mohammed. For more on this motif, 
see Vilnay, Legends of Jerusalem, 23-24. 

David Re'uveni reports an Arab tradition of a cavern carved into the Foundation Stone, 
where Abraham, Isaac, David, Solomon, and Elijah are all said to have prayed, and their 
souls still are said to gather there to pray. This cave is still there, inside the Rock. 

Another source suggests that a meteor fell down in the place where the Holy of 
Holies was later situated. The tradition refers to 2 Samuel 24:16 and 1 Chronicles 21:26.

126 . CREATION BY THOUGHT 

Before the world was created, God and His Name existed alone. God first conceived of 
the form of the world in His mind, making a world perceptible only by the intellect. Later 
God completed one visible to the external senses, using the world created in thought as 
the model. 



THE (OSMK SEED 99 


The conception for Creation came to God by night, and the work was done by day. 
When it entered His mind to create the world, God drew up the plans. Dividing light 
from darkness. He prepared the dawn in the knowledge of His heart. 

Some say that God created the world for six days and nights, but the work was not 
completed until the sun reached the horizon on the sixth day. Others say that everything 
was created in the first instant, when God conceived the world. All that took place on the 
other days was that specific things were revealed, for everything had been prepared on 
the first day. 

Philo's concept of the model in thought that God used as the basis for the creation 
of the world is clearly adapted from Platonic thought, and it also conveys the rabbinic 
view that God based the creation of the world on a model. This suggests creation by 
archetype, and it is the basis of much rabbinic speculation about creation, especially 
of a mystical nature. Some midrashim speak of God's plan for the world. Others de- 
scribe the Torah as the plan on which this world was built.

127. A SINGLE UTTERANCE 

God, in His omnipotence, created the entire universe simultaneously. He did so in a single 
utterance, without a single word preceding or following it, as it is said, God spoke all these 
words saying (Exod. 20:1). Heaven and earth and all that they contain were included in that 
utterance. There was nothing that came into existence earlier or later than anything else. 

However, the universe that God created with a single utterance lacked order. After 
having created the universe, God proceeded to put it in order. On the first day God sepa- 
rated light from darkness, as the first step in creating order. On the second day He estab- 
lished a division between different kinds of waters. Thus what occurred in the six days of 
Creation was merely the establishment of order in an existing universe. 

In this way were heaven and earth and everything therein created at the same instant. 

This commentary by Rabbi Hayim ben Attar (1696-1743), best known by the title of 
his commentary on the Torah, the Or ha-Hayim, is based on an interpretation of the verse 
for on it (the Sabbath) He rested from all His work which He had created in order to complete it 
(Gen. 2:2). Hayim ben Attar reads this verse as proof that the world had already been 
created — by a single utterance. 

There is also a tradition that God spoke the Ten Commandments in a single utter- 
ance (Mishnat Rabbi Eliezer).

Or ha-Hayim, Bereshit 1:1. 


128. THE DIVIDED WORLD 

When God created the world, He divided it into two parts: one part habitable and the other 
a desert, one on one side of the world and the other on the other side. Then he redivided the 
habitable part so that it formed a circle, the center of which is the Holy Land. And the 
center of the Holy Land is Jerusalem, and the center of Jerusalem is the Holy of Holies, 
where the Shekhinah dwells. The nourishment of all good things in the inhabited world 
flows from there, and there is nowhere that is not sustained by that source. 



100 MYTHS OF CREATION 


God also divided the desert. That was the desert, the most terrible and sinister in the 
world, where the Israelites wandered for 40 long years. The Other Side — the side of evil — 
reigned in that desert. Had they been worthy, they might have broken its power for all 
time. But each time they provoked God to anger, the Other Side held sway, and they 
became subject to its power. 

Only after 40 years of wandering did the Israelites break the power of the Other Side 
and prevail. That is when they found their way back to the Holy Land. 

This is both a creation myth and a kabbalistic allegory. As a creation myth, it de- 
scribes a process of creation in which God first divided the world in halves, and later 
redivided the habitable part so that it formed a circle, which is where the Holy Land is 
located. In this it is also a myth about the creation of the Holy Land, and its location at 
the center of the world. Many medieval maps illustrated the Holy Land and Jerusa- 
lem as the navel of the world. For other myths about the creation of the Holy Land, 
see "Myths of the Holy Land," pp. 401-429. 

At the same time, this is a kabbalistic allegory about the two sides of existence — 
the Side of Holiness, and the Sitra Ahra, the Other Side. All of existence is thus por- 
trayed as being polar, with these opposing forces always active. The Shekhinah, for 
example, represents the Side of Holiness, whereas Lilith represents the Sitra Ahra .

129. THE ORIGIN OF CHAOS 

What existed before the world was created? Tohu and vohu, chaos and void. Some say 
that nothing existed before them. Others disagree, and recount the origin of chaos. 

Chaos comes from a shadow known as darkness. Where did darkness come from? 
From something that existed before the world was created, since the very beginning of 
all existence. Thus chaos was projected from darkness, while darkness was created by 
the first thing that existed. Immortal beings were brought into being by that infinite source, 
every kind of divinity, and a likeness emanated from it, known as Wisdom, which took 
the form of the primordial light. In this way Wisdom serves as a veil, separating mankind 
from the world above. 

This is a key Gnostic myth from On the Origin of the World , one of the Nag Hammadi 
texts, which is dominated by Jewish influences. In many respects, it is a commentary 
on the creation story in Genesis. The Gnostic reading of Genesis tries to probe the 
origin of tohu (chaos) and vohu (void) in Genesis 1:2: Now the earth was unformed and 
void . ("Unformed" is a translation of tohu.) The Gnostic interpretation also draws on 
the concept of darkness in the next part of the verse, and darkness was upon the face of the 
deep. Here "darkness" is understood as having existed before chaos, and darkness 
itself is brought into being by an unnamed infinite force. This shows a form of cre- 
ation by emanation, which is also the basis of the later kabbalistic system of emana- 
tion known as the ten sefirot. In the Gnostic myth, the infinite force brings darkness 
into being, which, in turn, leads to the emanation of chaos. The Gnostic myth also 
goes a step further, describing a concurrent or synonymous creation of immortal be- 
ings, as well as the creation of Wisdom, personified here as a likeness emanated from 
the infinite force. Wisdom — Sophia in Greek — is a key mythic figure in Gnostic texts, a 
role far exceeding the development found in Jewish texts. See "The Creation of Wis- 
dom," p. 45. 

Note the linkage of Sophia (Wisdom personified) and the primordial light, created 
on the first day, when God said, "Let there he light" Some Jewish sources also identify 



MYTHS OF ORI6IN 101 


this sacred light as a pre-existing source, much as darkness is described in this Gnos- 
tic myth. See "Light from the Temple," p. 411, and "The Light of the First Day," p. 83.

130. THE FIRST SUNSET 

On the day of his creation, when Adam saw the sun set for the first time, he said to Eve, 
"Because we have sinned, the world around us is growing dark. Soon the universe will 
become void and without form, as it was before God brought it into being. This must 
mean that we have been sentenced to death." 

So Adam and Eve stayed up all night weeping and fasting. But when the sun rose at 
dawn, Adam was greatly relieved and said, "There must be a course that the sun fol- 
lows." After that, Adam put on priestly garments and offered a bullock as a sacrifice, out 
of gratitude that their lives had been spared. And when Adam died those garments were 
inherited by Seth. 

There are a number of variants of this myth. In some, Adam first experiences dark- 
ness on the day of his creation; in others, after the end of the Sabbath. His response is 
the universal fear of darkness, but in some versions it is because Adam is afraid they 
have been condemned to death because of their sin, and that God is uncreating the 
world, while in other sources he is afraid that the serpent will now be able to bite him. 

See the following myth, "The Origin of Fire," for an example of the latter myth. 

In the Bible, Moses' brother Aaron is identified as the first High Priest. But here 
Adam performs the role and passes the priestly garments on to his son, Seth. This is a 
variant on the myth of the handing down of the garments of Adam and Eve men- 
tioned in Genesis 3:21: And the Lord God made garments of skins for Adam and his wife , and 
clothed them . See "The Garments of Adam and Eve," p. 437. 

This myth offers the origin of Havdalah , the ceremony of separation at the end of 
the Sabbath.

131. THE ORIGIN OF FIRE 

For the first week of Creation, the sun shone day and night. But when the sun sank at the 
end of the Sabbath, and darkness came closer, Adam grew terrified. He cried out to God 
that the serpent was coming to harm him. Then God told Adam to take two flints and to 
strike them against each other. And when he did, fire came forth, much to Adam's amaze- 
ment, and he uttered a spontaneous blessing over it. That is why a blessing is recited over 
a candle at the end of the Sabbath, for fire was then created for the first time. 

Myths of origin are common in all mythic systems, including Judaism. Myths of 
the creation of the world, of the origin of man, and here, of the origin of fire, are all 
found in Jewish sources. Here God tells Adam how to make a fire, rubbing flints to- 
gether. This first fire is tied to the darkness that descends after the sun sets at the end 
of the Sabbath. Thus a series of origins are all linked together: the first Sabbath, the 
first sunset, the first darkness, the origin of fire — and the origin of the first blessing for 
the first Havdalah service, which takes place at the end of the Sabbath. See "Adam 
Brings Down Fire from Heaven," p. 137. 



102 MYTHS OF CREATION 


B. Pesahim 54a suggests that rather than God directing Adam to rub the flints to- 
gether, God inspired Adam with divine intuition, so that Adam knew on his own 
what he needed to do. See "The First Havdalah," p. 319.

132. WHAT CAUSES EARTHQUAKES? 

What causes the earth to quake? Some say that whenever God remembers the distress of 
His children, two drops fall from His eyes into the Great Sea and His voice resounds 
throughout the world — that is the earthquake. 

Others say that an earthquake is God clapping His hands, as it is said, "7, too , shall clap 
My hands together " (Ezek. 21:22). Still others say that it is God groaning, as it is said, "7 
shall abate My fury against them " (Ezek. 5:3). And there are others who say that an earth- 
quake is God stamping in the heavens, as it is said, A shout echoes throughout the earth (Jer. 
25:30). 

Finally, there are those who say that it is God squeezing His feet under the Throne of 
Glory. 


Here alternate mythic explanations of what causes an earthquake are all attributed 
to some action of God — His grief, anger, groaning, stamping, or squeezing His feet 
under the Throne of Glory. 

There is a mishnaic teaching that whenever a person experiences comets, earth- 
quakes {zeva'ot), lightning, thunder, or storms, one should say a blessing: "Blessed is 
He whose power and might fill the world" {Mishnah Berakhot 9:2). The meaning of 
zeva'ot is unclear. It may mean "dismay" or "quaking." In B. Berakhot 59a, Rav Qatina 
interprets it to mean "earthquake." While it may seem strange to say a blessing after 
an earthquake or some other manifestation of natural forces, it serves the purpose of 
acknowledging God's role in these powerful events.

133. THE ROOTS OF EVERYTHING 

During the six days of Creation, the foundations and roots of everything that would ever 
be brought into being were already created, as it is said, There is nothing new beneath the 
sun (Eccles. 1:19). For God looked over the entire Creation before it existed and prepared 
everything during those six days, and blessed it. And God's blessing still sustains us till 
this day, as it is said. And God blessed them (Gen. 1:22, 1:28, 5:2). 

Here we find the mythic notion of the six days of Creation as the archetype for all 
that would subsequently exist. Note that this is a thirteenth century understanding of 
the concept of the archetype, completely compatible with the Platonic concept. Fur- 
ther, it is revealed that the continued existence of the world depends on God's bless-

ing. It was given to the world then, and is still in effect. The implication is that we 
have to continue to deserve that blessing, or it could be withdrawn.

Zohar 1:47a. 


134. THE GREAT SEA 

Long ago, primeval waters covered the whole world. There were waters upon waters. 
Still, God poured more waters into them, even after they were full — He pressed down 
upon them and made them gather into one great sea, known as Okeanos. 

The great sea stands on the fins of Leviathan, and Leviathan dwells in the Lower Wa- 
ters, and appears in them as but a small fish in the sea. And the Lower Waters stand on 
the shore of the Waters of Ocean, and appear as but a small well there. And the Waters of 
Ocean stand on the shore of the Waters of Creation. And the Waters of Creation stand on 
the shore of the Weeping Waters. And the Weeping Waters stand on the shore of the 
Abyss. And the Abyss stands on tohu, chaos, and tohu stands on vohu, void. And all of this 
is suspended from the arm of God. 

The Okeanos Sea is said to surround the whole earth. There is a place in it called the 
Place of Swallowing where the waters swallow all the other waters that flow there. While 
on a voyage. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua happened upon this place, and took a 
barrel full of water from there. When Caesar asked them about the nature of the waters of 
Okeanos, they gave him a jug of this water, and they poured many barrels of water into 
that jug and it never overflowed, but swallowed all the waters poured into it. This ex- 
plains why all the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full (Eccles. 1:7). 

So too are the candles of the sun extinguished in the waters of Okeanos so that there is 
no light during the night, and the flames of the sun are not relit until the sun comes to the 
East and bathes in a River of Fire, called Nehar di-Nur. 

Once a month the clouds come down to drink of the waters of Okeanos. Once it hap- 
pened that the clouds swallowed, together with the water, a ship full of com, and after 
that com fell from the heavens mixed with rain. 

The idea of waters that encompass the earth is found in many of the world's myths. 
Okeanos, the name given to the Great Sea, is taken from the Greek god Okeanos, 
originally a river god, later the god of the sea. Okeanos was the offspring of Ouranos 
(Sky) and Gaia (Earth), and thus of the race of Titans that included Kronos, the father 
of Zeus. 

The Great Sea of Jewish mythology is really the Mediterranean, but it has been 
given mythic characteristics, such as standing on the fins of Leviathan. There are also 
mythic places within the ocean, such as the Place of Swallowing. So too is it the place 
where all the candles of the sun are extinguished, and miraculous events can take 
place, such as corn raining from the sky. These are the Jewish equivalents of Greek 
myths such as the Isle of the Blessed, in the waters of Okeanos, where the souls of 
heroes dwelled. 

For other Jewish myths of the ocean, see "The Rebellion of the Waters," p. 105 and 
"The Rebellion of Rahab," p. 106. For a variant myth, see "A Universe of Water," p. 94.

104 MYTHS OF CREATION 


135. THE FIERY WAVES 

It is said of waves that sink ships that they have a white fringe of fire. The only way to 
beat them back is to strike them with a club that has the words "I am that I am. Yah, the 
Lord of Hosts, Amen, Amen, Sela " engraved on it. Then the fiery waves will fall back. 

Fiery waves that sink ships are part of sea lore. The notion that a club bearing 
God's names can beat them back has echoes of Moses holding his arm over the Red 
sea, and God driving back the sea with a strong east wind (Exod. 14:21) According to 
Rabbi Samuel Eliezer Edels (1555-1631), known as the Maharsha, the waves represent 
the nations of the world that attempt to harm Israel. But God, whose names appear on 
the club, will protect His people and drive them back. "I Am that I Am" (Ehyeh-Asher- 
Ehyeh) is the name God used when He revealed Himself to Moses at the burning bush 
(Exod. 3:14).

B. Bava Batra 73a. 


136. THE UPPER WATERS AND THE LOWER WATERS 

The upper waters are masculine and the lower, feminine. At first the upper waters and 
the lower waters were commingled, until God said , " Let there be a firmament in the midst of 
the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters " (Gen. 1:6). But the upper waters and 
the lower waters refused to separate, clinging to each other. Some say that God raised 
His little finger and tore the waters into two parts, and forced half of them below. Others 
say that fire came forth that divided them, and in this way the upper waters were sepa- 
rated from the lower with great weeping. 

So it is that the upper waters remain suspended by Divine command, and their fruit is 
the rain water. The firmament in which the sun, moon, the stars, and the planets are 
suspended is the great meeting place where the upper waters are gathered, and from 
which the earth is watered. And when the rain is ready to fall, the upper waters say to the 
lower: "Receive me," and immediately they receive them, as a female receives a male. 
Thus the earth is fed from above, and all living things flourish here below. 

If the firmament dividing the waters from the waters were ever removed, even for an 
instant, the world would revert to utter chaos. It would be as if it had never existed at all, 
and things would be exactly as they were before God said, " Let there be a firmament in the 
midst of the waters . " 

The sky is the firmament that separates the waters above, which fall as rain, from 
the waters below, which rise up as springs. The midrashic interpretations of the upper 
waters and the lower waters all center on their identification as masculine and femi- 
nine, so powerfully drawn to each other that they resisted God's command to sepa- 
rate. While drawing on this midrashic reading, the Zohar also identifies the upper 
waters as Elohim and the lower as Yahweh, a Gnostic reading of the role of God's two 
primary names ( Zohar 1:17b). The Zohar also identifies the upper waters as the sefirah 
Hesed (Lovingkindness) and the lower with the sefirah Gevurah (Power). The fire that 
separated the upper and lower waters is linked in the Zohar with the fire of Gehenna, 
providing this as the origin of that fire. The Zohar (1:18a) points out the importance of 
diversity in the world, noting that "as long as the upper and lower waters were com- 
mingled, there was no production in the world. This could only take place when they 
were separated and became distinct." 



REBELLIONS AGAINST GOD 105 


Midrash Konen suggests that the myth of God using His little finger to separate the 
upper and lower waters grows out of the term raki'a, meaning "firmament/' linked to 
the word keri'ah, meaning "tearing apart." 

In Tanya , Rabbi Shneur Zalman (1745-1813) interprets the passage, Yahweh exists 
forever; Your word stands firm in heaven (Ps. 119:89) to refer to the firmament in the 
midst of the waters. He proposes that if the firmament were ever removed, the exist- 
ence of this world would come to an end. See "The Spirit of the Firmament," p. 105 
and "The Rebellion of the Waters," p. 105, for variants of this myth.

137. THE SPIRIT OF THE FIRMAMENT 

On the second day of Creation, God created the spirit of the firmament, and commanded 
him to separate the waters from the waters, so that one part might move upward and the 
other part remain beneath. 

This brief myth from 4 Ezra suggests that God created some kind of spirit, or per- 
haps angel, to separate the upper and lower waters. Therefore it was this spirit, rather 
than God, who forced the upper waters and lower waters to separate. In all other 
versions of this myth, it is God Himself who tears the upper and lower waters apart.

138. THE REBELLION OF THE WATERS 

On the second day of Creation, God tore the upper waters from the arms of the lower 
waters amidst great weeping, and the upper waters were suspended in the heavens by the 
word of God. On the third day, when God said, "Let the waters be gathered together " (Gen 1:9), 
the mountains and hills were raised up and scattered, and deep valleys were dug in the 
earth, into which the waters rolled. As soon as they had gathered together, the waters be- 
came rebellious, rising up almost to the Throne of Glory, and covered the face of the earth. 
But God rebuked the waters and said "Enough!" and subdued them beneath the soles of 
His feet. He trod down on them so that the air came out of them. When the rest of the 
waters saw how He had trampled the ocean, and heard its terrible cry, they fled. Even 
though they were seething, there was nowhere for them to go but to the sea. Therefore God 
surrounded the sea with sand, and measured it with the hollow of His hand, and made the 
sea swear that it would not go beyond the boundary He had set, as it is said. Who set the 
sand as a boundary to the sea (Jer. 5:22). Some say that God not only circled the sea with sand, 
but caused it to dry up, in accord with the verse He rebukes the sea and dries it up (Nah. 1:4). 

This midrash draws a link between God's separation of the upper and lower waters 
on the second day (see "The Upper Waters and the Lower Waters," p. 104) and the 
gathering of the waters on the third, suggesting that the waters rebelled because of then- 
anger at their recent separation. This midrash also comments on Psalm 93:3: The floods 
have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice, the floods lift up their roaring. God's 
quelling the rebellion of the waters clearly echoes the struggle between Marduk, the 



106 MYTHS OF CREATION 


rain god of Babylon, and Tiamat, the personification of primeval waters in the Babylonian 
epic, Enuma Elish. This epic struggle (also found in other Near Eastern texts) is hinted at 
in the Genesis creation narrative, where tehom, the deep, echoes Tiamat. The parallels to 
the Babylonian myth can be seen in the following passage from Enuma Elish , from Near 
Eastern Mythology by John Gray, 1969, p. 32: 

The Lord trod on the legs of Tiamat 

With his unsparing mace he crushed her skull. 

When the arteries of her blood he had severed. 

He split her like a shell-fish into two parts; 

Half of her he set up and sealed it as sky. 

Pulled down the bar and posted guards. 

He bade them not to allow her waters to escape. 

Exodus Rabbah 15:22 makes clear that the ocean was not only trampled by God, but 
slain: "Then God trampled upon the ocean and slew it." This text is sometimes inter- 
preted to mean that God slew its prince, Rahab. The reference to the hollow of God's 
hand comes from Isaiah 60:12. See the following myth, "The Rebellion of Rahab." 

In Likutei Moharan 1:2, Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav interprets God's command of 
"Enough!" to stop the expansion of the world as referring to the creation of the Sab- 
bath. The Sabbath, in effect, stops the work of the six days of the week.

139. THE REBELLION OF RAHAB 

When God desired to create the world. He said to Rahab, the angel of the sea: "Open 
your mouth and swallow all the waters of the world." Rahab replied: "Master of the 
Universe, I already have enough." God then kicked Rahab with His foot and killed him. 
And had not the waters covered him, no creature could have stood his foul odor. 

The traditions about God slaying Rahab grows out of Isaiah 51:9, Are you not he who 
cut Rahab in pieces , and wounded the dragon? and Psalms 89:10, You have trampled upon 
Rahab; you have scattered your enemies with your strong arm . This midrash is also based 
on Job 26:12: By His power He stilled the sea; by His skill He struck down Rahab . This myth 
is another version of "The Rebellion of the Waters," which describes the struggle be- 
tween God and tehom , the deep, and thus also echoes the battle between Marduk and 
Tiamat in the Babylonian epic, Enuma Elish. However, Tiamat is a feminine figure, 
while Rahab is masculine. 

In Enuma Elish Marduk uses Tiamat's body to build a new world, using half to make 
the heavens and half to make the earth. He uses considerable violence in defeating Tiamat, 
as does God in defeating Rahab. Marduk crushes her skull with his club, splits her body 
in two, and scatters her blood in the wind. In the Hebrew myth, the waters are personi- 
fied in Rahab, the Prince of the Sea, and instead of trampling the waters, God kicks and 
kills Rahab. There are hints in rabbinic writings that Rahab once had a great, godlike 
status. For example, it is stated in Deuteronomy Rabbah 2:28: "Rahab placed God in heaven 
and upon earth." Although Rahab is killed in this myth, he reappears in later legends as 
the Prince of the Sea, and performs various deeds at the command of God or one of the 
rabbis. See, for example, Y. Sanhedrin 7:23d, where Rabbi Joshua ben Haninah calls upon 
Rahab to recover a lost charm, so that a spell can be broken. 



REBELLIONS AGAINST COD 107 


Midrash Tanhuma tries to explain why God kicked Rahab, the angel of the ocean, 
who represents the ocean itself: "Why did God kill the angel? The rest of the waters, 
seeing that God kicked the ocean, and hearing its screams, fled without knowing where 
to flow, until they reached the place that God had prepared for them." This violent act 
is thus explained as a way to force the recalcitrant waters to gather in the right places. 
See "The Rebellion of the Waters," p. 105. 

An alternate version of the Rahab myth found in the Prologue to the Zohar 56 ex- 
plains that God's tears, hot as fire, shed over the exile of the Shekhinah, fall into the 
Great Sea and sustain Rahab. And Rahab sanctifies God's Name by swallowing all the 
waters of the days of Creation — the very act that Rahab refused to do in the other 
version of the myth, for which God killed him in anger. The moral of the two versions 
is clear: when Rahab refuses an order from God, he is slain; when he accepts the order, 
his life is sustained. 

For a further discussion of this myth, see the Introduction, p. li.

140. THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS 

When God decided to create the world. He addressed the Prince of Darkness, saying, 
"Get you hence. It is My intention to begin Creation with light." But the Prince of Dark- 
ness, who was black as a bull, was afraid that if the darkness were lit, he would become 
God's slave. So the Prince feigned deafness, and ignored God's rebuke, saying, "Why not 
create the world from darkness?" "Get you hence at once," God replied, "before you 
perish from the world!" "And after light what will You create?" asked the Prince of Dark- 
ness. God replied, "Darkness." 

So it was. But it is said that in End of Days the Prince of Darkness will declare himself 
equal to God, and claim to have taken part in Creation, saying, "Although God made 
heaven and light, it was I who made darkness and the pit of hell!" His angels will sup- 
port his claim, but the fires of hell will quench their arrogance. 

The identity of the Prince of Darkness is blurred in rabbinic texts. In this case, the 
Prince of Darkness is primarily a mythic personification of elemental darkness. At the 
same time, the rebellion of the Prince of Darkness is linked to the rebellions of the 
angels Satan (sometimes called Samael), and Lucifer. The identity of all of these an- 
gels, including the Prince of Darkness, blurs together in Jewish tradition. See "The 
Fall of Lucifer," p. 108. After God's rebuke, other princes in heaven proclaim the Prince 
of Darkness to be their king, and he rewards them by bestowing pavilions on them, as 
in the passage. He made pavilions of darkness about him (2 Sam. 22:12). But God then 
rebukes them for their rebelliousness and disperses them. Following the creation of 
light and darkness, the myth goes on to describe the creation of the signs of the zo- 
diac, linking rabbinic lore with the astrological.

108 MYTHS OF CREATION 


141. THE FALL OF LUCIFER 

At first Lucifer, the highest archangel, was the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and 
flawless in beauty. He resided on God's holy mountain; he walked among stones of fire. 
He was blameless in his ways until he was filled with lawlessness and sinned. For he 
said, "I will climb to the sky; higher than the stars of God will I set my throne." Then, on 
the second day of Creation, Lucifer, together with his legions of angels, attempted to set 
himself up as the equal of God. Then God hurled him from the heights, together with his 
angels, and cast them into a bottomless abyss. 

The myth of the fall of Lucifer finds its origin in the ancient Canaanite myth of 
Athtar, who attempted to rule the throne of Ba'al, but was forced to descend and rule 
the underworld instead. In Jewish sources, this myth only exists in fragmentary form, 
primarily in Isaiah 14:12 and 2 Enoch. The myth of Lucifer's fall plays a surprisingly 
minor role in Jewish mythology, perhaps because of the prominence it gained in Chris- 
tianity. Here, because of the statement by Jesus, I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven 
(Luke 18:10), Lucifer became identified with Satan, even though they are two entirely 
separate mythic figures. (It is interesting to note that in some recensions of 2 Enoch , 
Lucifer is identified with the angel Satanel.) From this point on, Lucifer and Satan 
become synonymous with the Devil in Christian lore, while the myth of Lucifer is 
essentially lost from Jewish tradition. Yet there is a clear distinction between Satan, 
the Tempter and heavenly prosecutor, who often cooperates with God, and with Luci- 
fer, who was cast out after rebelling. The fall of Lucifer also strongly echoes the ac- 
count in Genesis 6 of the descent of the Sons of God to earth from heaven. 

Once the myth of Lucifer was ceded to the Christians, the primary sources for the 
myth remained those in the Bible and Pseudepigrapha, and the myth ceased to be 
developed in the midrash. Indeed, it is necessary to reconstruct it from the existing 
fragments, not only in Isaiah and 2 Enoch, but also from Ezekiel 28:11-19, where Luci- 
fer is not directly named, but reference to his myth seems apparent. 

The name Lucifer also refers to the planet Venus, the morning star, which first ap- 
pears to dominate the heavens, but then disappears. This too parallels the pattern of 
the fall of Lucifer. Isaiah recounts the myth: 

How are you fallen from heaven, 

O Shining One, son of Dawn! 

How are you felled to earth, 

0 vanquisher of nations! 

Once you thought in your heart, 

1 will climb to the sky; 

Higher than the stars of God 

I will set my throne. 

I will sit in the mount of the assembly. 

On the summit of Zaphon: 

I will mount the back of a cloud — 

I will match the Most High. 

Instead, you are brought down to Sheol, 

to the bottom of the pit. 

Isaiah 14:12-13 

The account of Lucifer being cast out of heaven is also found in 2 Enoch 29, 4-5, where 
God Himself is the speaker, describes how Lucifer tried to overthrow Him and was cast 
out of heaven: "I hurled him out of the heights, together with his angels." 

By setting the myth on the second day of Creation, it is clear that the rebellion takes 
place strictly in heaven, without any consideration of human beings, who were yet to 
be created. The missing details of the fall of Lucifer appear to be found in Ezekiel 
28:11, although Lucifer is not directly named. Indeed, the passage seems to allude to 
the myth by means of allegory, in that it is addressed to the King of Tyre, who is about 
to experience a great fall. 



REBELLIONS AGAINST GOD 109 


These missing details make it possible to reconstruct the myth. Lucifer was beauti- 
ful and brilliant: You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and flawless in beauty (Ezek. 
28:11). Here Lucifer is described in terms very similar to that of the Greek gods. Here, 
too, is a direct statement of Lucifer's fate: I have struck you down from the mountain of 
God (Ezek. 28:17). The fate of the King of Tyre is thus parallel to that of Lucifer — both 
undergo a great fall. 

The ultimate fate of Lucifer appears to be some kind of eternal wandering, as he 
was brought down to Sheol , to the bottom of the Pit (Isa. 14:15). Sheol was the early Israel- 
ite version of Hell, although it more closely resembles the Greek tradition of Limbo. 
The meaning seems to be that God has cast Lucifer into the Abyss. 

A strong parallel to the myth of the fall of Lucifer is found in Vita Adae et Evae 15:2, 
where Michael speaks to Satan: "And Michael said, 'Worship the image of God, but if 
you will not, you will know the Lord's wrath.' And I (Satan) said: 'If He shows me His 
wrath, I will set my seat above the stars of heaven." 

Even though there is very little midrashic interest in the myth of Lucifer, a parallel 
myth emerges, also about rebellious angels, known as the Watchers. See "The Sons of 
God and the Daughters of Men," p. 454 and "The Watchers," p. 457. Here the fate of 
Lucifer is duplicated by the angel Azazel. Both are cast out of heaven into the Abyss, 
but Azazel is said to be chained upside down in a distant canyon, where he continues 
his evil plotting. For the cycle of myths of the Sons of God, see pp. 454-460. 

For a close variant of this myth, see "Satan Cast From Heaven," p. 109.

142. SATAN CAST FROM HEAVEN 

On the day that Adam was created, Satan went forth in heaven and flew like a bird in the 
air. God breathed His spirit into Adam, and Adam received the likeness of His image, as 
it is said. Let us make man in our image , after our likeness (Gen. 1:26). God summoned the 
angel Michael and said, "Behold — I have made Adam in the likeness of My image." 

So Michael summoned all the angels, and God said to them, "Come, bow down to the 
god I have made." 

Michael bowed down first. Then he called upon Satan and said, "You too bow down 
to Adam." 

Satan said, "I will not bow down to anyone created after me. It is not proper for me to 
bow down to Adam." And the other angels who were with him also refused to bow 
down to Adam. 

Then God became angry with Satan and cast him and all the angels who had followed 
him from heaven to the earth. So too did God announce that He would establish Adam's 
dominion on the throne of Satan, while Satan would be cast down so that Adam might sit 
above him. 

When Satan realized all that he had lost, he decided to avenge himself against Adam, 
who was living in the Garden of Eden. He carefully prepared a trap for Adam so that he, 
too, would be deprived of his happiness, just as Satan had been. And that is why Satan 
sought revenge against Adam and convinced Eve to taste the forbidden fruit. 



110 MYTHS OF CREATION 


This myth is a variant of the "The Fall of Lucifer," p. 108. Here the evil angel is identi- 
fied as Satan instead of Lucifer, and the rebellion was not planned in advance, but grows 
out of Satan's indignation at being asked to bow down to the newly created Adam, who is 
identified to the angels as a god: "Come, bow down to the god I have made." Satan's 
refusal to do so provokes God into casting him and all his followers to earth— not to hell. 
God's identification of Satan with sinners is confirmed in Targum to Job 27:7: "Let my 
enemy be like the sinner, and the one rising up against me like the wicked." 

In the present myth Satan's rebellion follows the creation of Adam, which took 
place on the sixth day of Creation, rather than at the beginning of Creation, as in the 
fall of Lucifer. Thus, in "The Fall of Lucifer," Lucifer rebels directly against God sim- 
ply to usurp God's power, out of his jealousy over God, while here Satan's rebellion is 
brought about by God's creation of Adam. This is stated explicitly in the Targum to Job 
31, in which Satan wanted to create another world, where he would have dominion, 
because all things were subservient to Adam on earth. 

This myth of Satan being cast out of heaven is also found in Christian sources, promi- 
nently in the Book of Revelation: And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called 
the Devil, and Satan , who deceives the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels 
were cast out with him (Rev. 12:9). Although Satan does not appear in the biblical account 
of the Fall, the identification of Satan with the serpent brought Satan to the forefront of 
this myth. See "How Cain was Conceived," p. 447, where Satan, riding the serpent, has 
intercourse with Eve, from which Cain is conceived. Thus the serpent fulfills its phallic 
role in the exegetic fantasies of the rabbis. 

A Muslim version of the myth of Satan (identified as Iblis) refusing to bow down 
before Adam is found in the Koran 7:11. 

God s identification of Adam as a god strongly echoes the basic Gnostic assump- 
tions about a Creator God and a demiurge. Here, although the role of the demiurgic 
Adam is unclear, we can recall the extensive traditions about the primordial Adam. 
See "Adam the Golem," p. 127, "Adam the Hermaphrodite," p. 138, and "Adam the 
Giant," p. 128.

143. SATAN'S BARGAIN WITH GOD 

There was a man in the land of Uz named Job. That man was blameless and upright; he 
feared God and shunned evil. Seven sons and three daughters were born to him; his 
possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of 
oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very large household. That man was wealthier 
than anyone in the East. 

It was the custom of his sons to hold feasts, each on his set day in his own home. They 
would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. When a round of feast days 
was over. Job would send word to them to sanctify themselves, and, rising early in the 
morning, he would make burnt offerings, one for each of them; for Job thought, "Perhaps 
my children have sinned and blasphemed God in their thoughts." This is what Job al- 
ways used to do. 



REBELLIONS AGAINST COD 111 


One day the divine beings presented themselves before the Lord, and the Adversary 
came along with them. The Lord said to the Adversary, "Where have you been?" The 
Adversary answered the Lord, "I have been roaming all over the earth." The Lord said to 
the Adversary, "Have you noticed My servant Job? There is no one like him on earth, a 
blameless and upright man who fears God and shuns evil!" The Adversary answered the 
Lord, "Does Job not have good reason to fear God? Why, it is You who have fenced him 
round, him and his household and all that he has. You have blessed his efforts so that his 
possessions spread out in the land. But lay Your hand upon all that he has and he will 
surely blaspheme You to Your face." The Lord replied to the Adversary, "See, all that he 
has is in your power; only do not lay a hand on him." The Adversary departed from the 
presence of the Lord. 

One day, as his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of 
their eldest brother, a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the 
she-asses were grazing alongside them when Sabeans attacked them and carried them 
off, and put the boys to the sword; I alone have escaped to tell you." This one was still 
speaking when another came and said, "God's fire fell from heaven, took hold of the 
sheep and the boys, and burned them up; I alone have escaped to tell you." This one was 
still speaking when another came and said, "A Chaldean formation of three columns 
made a raid on the camels and carried them off and put the boys to the sword; I alone 
have escaped to tell you." This one was still speaking when another came and said, "Your 
sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother 
when suddenly a mighty wind came from the wilderness. It struck the four comers of the 
house so that it collapsed upon the young people and they died; I alone have escaped to 
tell you." 

Then Job arose, tore his robe, cut off his hair, and threw himself on the ground and 
worshiped. He said, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return 
there; the Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord." 

For all that. Job did not sin nor did he cast reproach on God. 

One day the divine beings presented themselves before the Lord. The Adversary came 
along with them to present himself before the Lord. The Lord said to the Adversary, 
"Where have you been?" The Adversary answered the Lord, "I have been roaming all 
over the earth." The Lord said to the Adversary, "Have you noticed My servant Job? 
There is no one like him on earth, a blameless and upright man who fears God and shuns 
evil. He still keeps his integrity; so you have incited Me against him to destroy him for no 
good reason." The Adversary answered the Lord, "Skin for skin — all that a man has he 
will give up for his life. But lay a hand on his bones and his flesh, and he will surely 
blaspheme You to Your face." So the Lord said to the Adversary, "See, he is in your power; 
only spare his life." The Adversary departed from the presence of the Lord and inflicted 
a severe inflammation on Job from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. He took a 
potsherd to scratch himself as he sat in ashes. His wife said to him, "You still keep your 
integrity! Blaspheme God and die!" But he said to her, "You talk as any shameless woman 
might talk! Should we accept only good from God and not accept evil?" For all that. Job 
said nothing sinful. 

In this prologue to the Book of Job, God and Satan are together in heaven, and God 
is bragging to Satan about his loyal servant. Job. In many ways Job resembles Abraham, 
whose faith in God was likewise perfect, and Noah and Daniel are also identified in 
Ezekiel 14:12-20 as paradigms of righteousness, along with Job. At Satan's initiative, 

God and Satan strike a bargain — to test Job, to see just how faithful he really is. Job 
loses everything — his family, his health, his flocks, his wealth, but he remains faithful, 
and God wins the bet. Nevertheless, the voice of God that comes out of the whirlwind 



112 MYTHS OF CREATION 


at the end of Job is hardly consoling, and presents a harsh view of the realities of the 
world and how all decisions of fate ultimately belong to God. 

As a myth, the Book of Job puts man's life in this world in perspective, and under- 
scores its fragility and the need to maintain faith in God despite one's trials and tribu- 
lations. The friendly banter between God and Satan should not be overlooked— Satan 
is clearly at home in heaven and he and God converse like old friends. Nevertheless, 
Satan is clearly identified as the Adversary, whose job it is to portray God's children 
in the worst possible light. That God agrees to undergo this devastating test of Job 
indicates that God ultimately views His human creations as objects who can be toyed 
with. Thus the underlying view of the relationship between God and man in the Book 
of Job is quite grim.

144. THE QUARREL OF THE SUN AND THE MOON 

In the beginning there was no difference between the two great lights of the sun or moon. 
They were both created to light the earth, and for signs and for seasons, and they were 
equal in all respects: in their height, shape, and in the amount of light they each cast. But 
no sooner were they created, than they began to quarrel. Each said to the other: "I am 
bigger than you are." 

At last the moon complained to God that the heavens and earth could not have two 
luminaries of equal size, saying, "Master of the Universe, is it possible for two kings to 
wear one crown?" God replied: "Go then and make yourself smaller." "In that case," said 
the moon, "what will then be the light of the sun?" God replied, "The sun's li ght will 
grow sevenfold!" "Master of the universe," cried the moon, "do I deserve such a fate?" 

Fear not, said God, "for Israel shall reckon the days and the years by you, and one day 
you will be restored to your original state." Still the moon obstinately refused to become 
smaller. Then God rebuked the moon and she fell from her high estate, and sparks fell 
from her over the whole sky, creating stars that diminished her light. 

Thus the rebellion of the moon brought about its decrease, while the rule of the sun 
was increased, as it is said, the greater light to dominate the day, the lesser light to dominate the 
night, and the stars (Gen. 1:16). However, in the time to come, the light of the moon shall be as 
the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall become sevenfold, like the light of the seven days 
(Isa. 30:26). 

The notion that the sun and moon were once equal is derived from the biblical 
verse God made the two great lights (Gen. 1:16). This sun and moon myth is a commen- 
tary on the passage. The greater light to dominate the day and the lesser light to dominate the 
night (Gen. 1:16). It not only explains how the moon lost its light and was made smaller, 
but also provides the origin of the stars from the former light of the moon. Rashi and 
Rabbi Judah Loew (1525-1609) of Prague interpret the creation of the stars as an at- 
tempt to appease the moon. This notion is confirmed by Genesis Rabbah 6:4: "Since the 
moon diminished itself to rule only at night, God decreed that when it appears, the 
stars shall accompany it. Others say that the moon was diminished because it intruded 
into the sphere of the sun, sometimes being visible during the day." The final quote 
from Isaiah 30:26 can also be seen as a rare example of a biblical midrash, identifying 
the light of the seven days of Creation with the primordial light, by stating that the 
light of the first day was seven times as powerful as the light of the sun. See "The 
Light of the First Day," p. 83. 

In the allegorical reading of this myth, the sun represents the Gentiles and the moon, 
the Jews. In Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 51, the identification of Israel with the moon, the 



MYTHS OF THE SUN AND MOON 113 


lesser light, is explained by pointing out that just as the moon restores itself monthly, 
so will Israel in the future be renewed. 

Note that the Jews, the descendants of Jacob, the younger brother, use a lunar cal- 
endar, while the descendants of Esau use a solar one. In Genesis Rabbah 6:3, it says that 
"It is natural for the older of two brothers to set his calendar by the greater luminary, 
and the younger by the lesser light." 

This myth raises the question of whether it is possible for God to make a mistake, 
in creating the sun and moon as equals, then commanding the moon to diminish it- 
self. One explanation is that the moon brought about its own fate by seeking to be- 
come greater than the sun, and it was diminished at once, and has been that way ever 
since. That is why the prayers offered on Kiddush Levanah, the Blessing of the Moon, 
say, "I pray to You, God, to make the moon whole again as it was before it was dimin- 
ished." Here the moon symbolizes the people of Israel, and the prayer is also a plea 
for Israel to be restored to its former glory. 

3 Baruch 9:6-7 offers an alternate explanation for the shrinking of the moon: "Dur- 
ing the transgression of Adam, the moon gave light to Samael (one of the names of 
Satan), when he took the serpent as a garment, and did not hide, but on the contrary, 
grew greater. And God was angered with the moon, and diminished her and short- 
ened her days." Here the moon is implicated in SamaeTs plot to bring about the trans- 
gression of Adam and Eve, and as a result, God shrinks it as a punishment. 

There are other Jewish myths in which the sun and moon are personified. Midrash 
TehiUim 19:11 describes how the sun and moon are blinded every day by the radiance 
from above, so they delay going forth. What does God do then? He shines forth for 
them, and they come forth in His light. And when they are about to go back, they 
cannot tell where to go, and they tarry. But God scatters torches, arrows, and spears of 
light before them, and guides diem toward where they should go. Here the sun and 
moon are shown to be dependent on God's guidance in order to rise and set. The 
theological point, of course, is that everything in the universe, including the sun and 
moon, depends on God's guidance.

145. THE SUN STOOD STILL 

On that occasion, when the Lord routed the Amorites before the Israelites, Joshua ad- 
dressed the Lord; he said in the presence of the Israelites: "Stand still, O sun, at Gibeon, O 
moon, in the Valley of Aijalon!" And the sun stood still and the moon halted, while a 
nation wreaked judgment on its foes — as is written in the Book of Yashar. Thus the sun 
halted in midheaven, and did not press on to set for a whole day, for the Lord fought for 
Israel. Neither before nor since has there ever been such a day, when the Lord acted on 
words spoken by a man. 

After the parting of the Red Sea, the most famous miraculous event in the Bible is 
the sun standing still in the sky in Joshua 10:12-14. Both of these examples demon- 
strate that God can overrule the powers of nature at His command, and, of course, 
both examples served to benefit Israel.

114 MYTHS OF CREATION 


146. A GARMENT FOR THE MOON 

Once upon a time, the moon came to the sun with a complaint: the sun was able to shine 
during the warmth of day, especially during the summer, while the moon could shine 
only during the cool of night. The sun saw that the moon was unhappy with her lot, 
particularly in the wintertime, so he told the moon he would have a garment sewn for 
her, to keep her warm. Then the sun called upon all the great tailors to make a garment 
for the moon. The simple tailors also wanted to help, but they weren't invited so they 
didn't go. 

After discussing the matter for some time, the great tailors came to the conclusion that 
it was simply impossible to sew a garment that would fit, because the moon is sometimes 
little and sometimes big. What measurements were they to use? Now when the little 
tailors heard this, they said, "If the big tailors won't do it, we will." But the big tailors 
scoffed when they heard this and said, "If we can't do it, how could you?" 

This is a fragmentary tale told by Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav. Nachman not only 
told the famous 13 stories in Sippurei Ma’asiyot, but he told several dozen brief tales, 
including some unfinished tales. "A Garment for the Moon" is one of these. It follows 
the midrashic tradition about the sun and the moon, especially the tale of "The Quarrel 
of the Sun and Moon." (See p. 112.) The tale ends with the offer of the poor tailors to 
help the great tailors in sewing a garment for the moon, which the great tailors refuse. 

Such fragmentary and incomplete tales were often told by Rabbi Nachman and were 
dutifully recorded by his scribe. Rabbi Nathan of Nemirov. The fact that the big tailors 
have the last word here is a clear indication that the tale was unfinished, as Rabbi 
Nachman's sympathies in such cases were always with the "little" people. In fact, a 
passage from Genesis Rabbah (6:3) strongly suggests the identification of the poor tailors 
with the Jews: "Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Jose ben Lai: 'It is but natural that 
the great should count by the great, and the small by the small. Esau counts time by the 
sun, which is large, and Jacob by the moon, which is small.'" The discussion is contin- 
ued by a sage whose name also happens to be Rabbi Nachman: "Said Rabbi Nachman: 

That is a happy augury. Esau counts by the sun, which is large: just as the sun rules by 
day but not by night, so does Esau enjoy this world, but has naught in the World to 
Come. Jacob counts by the moon, which is small: just as the moon rules by day and by 
night, so has Jacob a portion in this world and the World to Come.'" 

The present dependent condition of the moon on the sun echoes a talmudic myth 
(B. Hullin 60b) about competition between the sun and the moon, which is a commen- 
tary on the passage. And God made the two great lights (Gen. 1:16): "The moon said to 
the Holy One, blessed be He, 'Master of the Universe, is it possible for two kings to 
wear one crown?' God replied: 'Go then and make yourself smaller.'" Thus the rebel- 
lion of the moon brought about its decrease. This talmudic legend is echoed in a dia- 
logue, closely resembling that in Rabbi Nachman's tale, found in Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 
6: "Rivalry ensued between the sun and the moon, and one said to the other, 'I am 
bigger than you are.' The other rejoined, 'I am bigger than you are.' What did the Holy 
One, blessed be He, do, so that there should be peace between them? He made the one 
larger and the other smaller, as it is said. The greater light to rule by the day, and the lesser 
light to rule the night, and the stars" (Genesis 1:16). It seems certain that Rabbi Nachman 
had these rabbinic myths in mind when he told his enticing, fragmentary tale. It is 
also possible to read this tale as an allegory in which Israel is the moon, God is the 
sun, and the garment is the Torah, which protects Israel against the winters of Exile. 

See "A Garment for the Moon" in Miriam's Tambourine, pp. 287-294, which attempts 
to complete this fragmentary tale.

CREATION BY ANCELS 115 


147 . THE CREATION OF ANGELS 

Some say that God created the angels on the first day — angels of the presence and angels 
of sanctification, angels of the spirits of fire and angels of the spirits of the winds, angels 
of the spirits of the clouds and angels of the darkness, angels of snow and hail and frost, 
and the angels of thunder and lightning, as it is said. When the morning stars sang together 
and all the divine beings shouted for joy (Job 38:7). Some say that God formed the features of 
the faces of every angel with His little finger, and after that blew spirit and breath into 
them, and placed them upon their feet, and opened their eyes. Others say that God cre- 
ated the angels on the second day, or on the fifth. And there are even those who say that 
the angels were created before the creation of the world. 

How did God create the angels? Some say that from every single word that God utters, 
an angel is created, as it is said. By the word ofYahweh the heavens were made , by the breath of 
His mouth all their host (Ps. 33:6). These angels are nourished by the splendor of the Shek- 
hinah. 

Others say that from fire God created every kind of angel, and all of the armies of the 
angels. 

Still others say that every day God creates angels from the fiery stream in Paradise, 
who sing praises of God one time and then cease to exist. 

The first indication that angels were created during the six days of Creation is found 
in Genesis 2:1: The heavens and the earth were finished , and all their hosts . "Hosts" is un- 
derstood to refer to the angels. However, it is not clear on which day of Creation the 
angels were brought into being, nor how God created them. Most texts identify the 
day the angels were created as the second or fifth day of Creation, although The Book 
of jubilees recounts the creation of angels on the first day, as does 4 Ezra , which states 
that God created the angels "from the beginning." As for how the angels were created, 
in B. Hagigah 14b two methods are described, angels created out of God's utterances, 
and angels created out of the heavenly river of fire. The point of the discussion seems 
to be that God personally created the angels, "the ranks of the bodiless armies," as 2 
Enoch 29:3 puts it. As to when this took place, the second and fifth days indicate that 
God had no assistance in the creating the world, for the angels had not yet been cre- 
ated. However, the traditions that link the creation of angels to the first day, or even 
prior to the creation of the world, may indicate the opposite — that the angels might 
have played a role in Creation. The belief that the angels were among the things cre- 
ated before the Creation, found in Eliyahu Rabbah, grows out of an interpretation of 
Genesis 1:1, which is understood to mean, "In the beginning He created Elohim ." Here 
Elohim does not refer to God, although it is one of the names of God, but instead it is 
one of the terms used to refer to angels. Job 38:4-7 also seems to indicate that the 
angels were among God's first creations. This notion is also found in the Hellenistic 
Synagogal Prayers : "God created before everything else the cherubim and the sera- 
phim . . . the archangels and the angels" (Apostolic Constitutions 8:12:14).

116 MYTHS OF CREATION 


148. CREATION BY ANGELS 

Did God have the assistance of the angels in the creation of the world? Most say that God 
created the world by Himself, and not by means of an angel and not by means of a messen- 
ger. But some say that God commanded the angels, and they obeyed Him. In this way the 
heavens were created with the light of the angels, and some say it was even the angels who 
stretched out the heavens, Gabriel in the north and Michael in the south. Others say that 
when God created the world. He created all things in the form of angels, for they are the 
foundation of all created things. The angels were emanated from the splendor of His glori- 
ous light. Then the heavens were created upon this foundation of angels. 

Those who say that God worked alone insist that none of the angels were created on 
the first day. But those who claim that the angels assisted God say that every kind of 
angel was created on the first day, and that God had a partner in His work of Creation. 
For just as by the word of Yahweh the heavens were made, so too were all the hosts of angels 
made by the breath of His mouth (Ps. 33:6). And since breath comes before speech, it can be 
concluded that the angels were created first. Not so, say the others. In this case, God 
reversed the usual order of breath and word by creating with the word although no 
breath had as yet emanated from His mouth. Thus the heavens were created first, and the 
angels followed. 

On this, however, all agree: once the world was created, the angels came to play an 
important role. Each day, before the sun rises, the angels lead the sun through a heavenly 
stream, to cool it off and prevent it from scorching the earth. Then the angels guide the 
sun in its journey. The angels also serve as messengers of God. When they are sent to this 
world to carry out a mission, they become clothed in a body formed from air or fire. 
When they are sent by God s word, they become winds, as it is said. He made His angels 
winds (Ps. 104:4), but when they serve God as ministers, they are made of fire. Thus they 
appear in human form, but as soon as they complete their duties, they divest themselves 
of their bodies and return to their spiritual state. 

So too does an angel serve as the prince over each of the elements. Gabriel is the Prince 
of Fire, Rahab the Prince of the Sea, Ridya the Prince of Rain, and Michael the Prince of 
Hail. There are also four angels that surround God's throne, the archangels Michael, 
Gabriel, Uriel, and Raphael. That is why it is said in the prayers recited before sleeping, 
"May Michael be at my right hand, Gabriel at my left, before me Uriel, behind me Raphael' 
and above my head the Divine Presence of God." 

There are differing accounts as to when the angels were created, and these differ- 
ences are directly related to the question of whether or not the angels participated in 
the creation of the world. The Book of Jubilees places the creation of the angels on the 
first day of Creation. Other sources, such as Targum Pseudo-Yonathan on Genesis 1:26, 
Midrash Konen and Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 4, put the creation of the angels on the second 
day. Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer says, "As for the angels created on the second day, when 
they are sent as messengers, they are changed into winds, and when they minister 
before God, they are changed into fire." Targum Pseudo-Yonathan says, "And God said 
to the angels who minister before him, who were created on the second day of the 
creation of the world, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness"’ (Gen. 1:26). 

Genesis Rabbah 1:3 places the creation of the angels on the fifth day. 

The rejection of the notion that the angels participated in Creation derives from around 
the third century. The day on which the angels were created thus becomes of crucial 
importance. If on the first day, as in 77k Book of Jubilees, which dates from the first cen- 
tury, it suggests that the angels were available to assist God. But this was seen to raise 
questions about the singularity of God's role, and therefore most later texts describe the 
creation of the angels as taking place on either the second or the fifth day of Creation. 



CREATION BY AN6ELS 117 


Why were the angels not created on the first day? So that it would not be said: 
"Michael was standing in the north with Gabriel in the south, and together they spread 
out the heavens and the earth" ( Midrash Tanhuma, Bereshit 1). This purposely alludes 
to Isaiah 44:24; "It is I, Yahzveh , who made everything , who alone stretched out the heavens 
and unaided spread out the earth." However, whenever the phrase, "so that it would not 
be said" appears, it can be assumed that heretics — and sometimes those within the 
tradition — were saying such things. 

A version of this statement in the Sefer ha-Bahir 22 adds God to the equation: "All 
agree that none of the angels were created on the first day. It should therefore not be 
said that Michael drew out the heaven at the south, and Gabriel drew it out at the 
north, while God arranged things in the middle." It seems likely that, as in the case of 
all such repudiations, the rabbis are referring to an existing tradition within Judaism 
(possibly by Jewish Gnostics), even if those who asserted it were regarded as heretics. 
Ironically, the rabbis' own sacred texts have preserved the existence of these heretical 
myths, which might otherwise have been lost. 

As a warning to those who would put their faith in the angels instead of in God, B. 
Berakhot 13a states: "If trouble befall a man, let him not cry to Michael or Gabriel, but 
let him cry to Me and I will answer him at once." 

The idea that the angels were created by the sayings of God comes from the verse By 
the word ofYahweh the heavens were made, by the breath of His mouth , all their host (Ps. 33:6). 

The debate about the participation of the angels in Creation can be seen as a continu- 
ation of the mythic dialectic within Judaism, as it swung between a monotheistic view 
and a mythic view that was ready to incorporate other supernatural forces, including 
the angels and other heavenly figures, such as the Bride of God and the Messiah.

149. ANAFIEL, THE CREATOR OF THE BEGINNING 

The angel Anafiel rules over all the other angels and guards the entrances to the palaces 
of the highest heaven, Aravot . When the other angels see him they remove the crown of 
glory from their heads and fall on their faces. His glory and radiance cover the chambers 
of the upper heaven, as it is said. His majesty covers the skies , His splendor fills the earth (Hab. 
3:3). Some say that he is the creator of the beginning, while others say that he is the 
creator of the world. It is he who possesses the secrets of heaven. 

It was the angel Anafiel whom God sent to bring Enoch into heaven, where he was 
transformed into the angel Metatron. So too was it Anafiel who was sent to strike Metatron 
with sixty fiery lashes when he did not rise from his throne when Elisha ben Abuyah 
approached him during his ascent on high. 

* The angel Anafiel is a highly exalted figure, an archangel, who is said to have helped 

God in the Creation, and is known as the Creator of the Beginning. He is also described 



118 MYTHS OF CREATION 


as one of the gatekeepers of the seventh palace. His official name is Anafiel YHVH, as the 
high archangels carry YHVH, the Tetragrammaton, as part of their names. The fact that 
Anafiel is described as being superior to Metatron — and, in some versions, that it was 
Anafiel who delivered the punishment of sixty fiery lashes to Metatron— emphasizes his 
importance and indicates that Anafiel was originally regarded as a supreme being who 
took part in the creation of the world. However, the role of Anafiel receded as that of 
Metatron was elevated, and today the only evidence of Anafiel's supreme role in the heav- 
enly hierarchy is found in isolated fragments of die Hekhalot and Merkavah literature.

150. THE CREATOR OF THE WORLD 

God's Chariot flies from one end of the universe to the other in the blink of an eye. God's 
Throne is a part of that chariot, and there is a divine figure seated upon that throne. Who 
sits there? Some say it is the Holy One Himself who is seated there. Others say it is Yotzer 
Bereshit and that it was he who created the world, for all the secrets of Creation were 
revealed to him. That is why he is known as the "Creator of the World," for he is the 
maker of Creation. 


In Shi'ur Komah, which describes the dimensions of the figure of God, the Primordial 
Man on the Merkavah, the divine throne, is identified as Yotzer Bereshit, the Creator of 
the World. The Primordial Man is usually identified as Adam Kadmon. See "Adam 
Kadmon," p. 15. It is not clear whether or not Yotzer Bereshit should be identified as an 
independent divine figure, a kind of demiurge, or simply as another of God's names, as 
appears to be the case in the Aleinu prayer: "It is our duty to praise the Lord of all things, 
to ascribe greatness to Him who formed the world in the beginning." The ambiguity 
about the identity of this mysterious figure suggests his role as a demiurge, as rabbinic 
and kabbalistic literature is full of hints that the divine figure who created the world 
had some kind of independent existence from the unknown aspect of God known in 
kabbalah as Ein Sof. The Primordial Man is understood both as a transitional phase of 
Creation and as the first created being, and as such is a Jewish version of the Gnostic 
myth of the Creator God and the demiurge.

151. THE FIRST CREATED BEING 

The First Created Being was the first emanation from the Hidden Cause. He is every- 
where, and everything is in him, as it is said. The whole earth is full of his glory (Isa. 6:3), and 
all beings exist through him, for he is the source of all existence. 

When Moses said, "Make known to me Your Glory " (Exod. 33:18), he was requesting to 
know the First Created Being. Moses did not wish to know and see the essence of the 
Creator, since he knew this could not be grasped. 



CREATION BY ANCELS 119 


Various rabbinic and kabbalistic sources speak of the First Created Being (ha-nivra 
ha-rishon), a divine figure or force that was created prior to the creation of the world. 
The concept of the First Created Being has its origin in a Neo-Platonic concept origi- 
nating with Plotinus, in which God, the " absolute One," is the creator of the Universal 
Intellect, identical both with the "First Emanation" and "First Created Being," which 
in turn is the first link in a chain of emanations. Rabbi Jacob ben Sheshet of Gerona 
(thirteenth century), an early kabbalist, identified this First Emanation (ha-ne'etzal ha- 
rishon) from the Hidden Cause (the unknown aspect of God). The second term, "First 
Created Being," serves to designate the Universal Intellect emanated from God. The 
First Created Being, in turn, creates the Universal Soul, and the World of Nature, in- 
cluding the seven celestial spheres, is said to emanate in turn from the Universal Soul. 

Saadiah Gaon identified the Shekhinah as the First Created Being, as well as the 
source of revelation. 

This concept of the First Created Being plays a major role in the writings of Rabbi 
Isaac ben Abraham ibn Latif, who lived in the thirteenth century, based on Ibn GabiroTs 
doctrine of the Divine Will. This primordial Will, which Ibn Latif calls the First Cre- 
ated Being, is coexistent with God and is the source of all reality: "All things exist 
through him by way of emanation, and nothing exists outside of him."

152. THE ANGEL WHO CREATED THE WORLD 

There are those who say that God, the First Creator, created only a single angel. God 
appointed this angel as His proxy. And this angel, in turn, created the whole world. He 
created all things perfect and complete in the first moments of Creation, including Adam 
and Eve and the other living beings, as well as the plants and trees. So too did he create 
the sun and the moon and the stars according to the utmost degree of their possible 
perfection. He arranged the stars in the sky, giving to each its proper place and creating 
their beauty. Thus the world was created perfect and whole. 

God spoke to the prophets through this angel, and it is this angel who performed 
miracles and through whom the Law was revealed to Moses. Indeed, it is this angel who 
brings about everything that happens in the world. 

Others say that God selected a certain angel from all those who attend upon Him, to 
confer His name upon him, and to proclaim this angel as His apostle, whose place in the 
world was God's place, and whose word was God's word. That angel is the elect one of 
the world. 

This strongly Gnostic myth was held by the Magharians ("cave dwellers"), a Jew- 
ish sect who lived at the time of the Sadducees, before the rise of Christianity. They 
were known as "cave dwellers" because their books were found in a cave. They felt 
the Sadducees had anthropomorphized the Creator, and objected to this approach to 
scriptural interpretation. Their strong belief was that God cannot be compared to any 
created being, and that all statements to this effect in the Torah refer to an angel. Ac- 
cording to the Magharians, it is this angel who is spoken of as God in the Bible. Yet 
while the parallels of the belief of the Magharians to Gnostic views is apparent, there 
are also differences. The demiurge in Gnosticism is not God's agent, but is usually 



120 MYTHS OF CREATION 


described as an evil being who is in opposition to the good God. But the theology of 
the Magharians is consistent with other Gnostic systems with conspicuous Jewish 
elements, where the demiurgic role is usually played by an angel or an elevated hu- 
man, such as Adam. 

The Magharians also teach that God spoke to the prophets through this pre-existent 
angel. This implies that the angel is in some ways working God's will. The Magharians 
felt it was quite natural for God to send a messenger and give him His Name and say, 
"This is My messenger, and his position among you is My position, and his word and 
command My word and command, and his appearance My appearance." 

This, the primary myth of the Magharians, grew out of their distress at the use of 
anthropomorphic expressions for God in the Bible. They objected to biblical phrases 
such as God came, God ascended into the clouds," "He has written the Torah with 
His hand," "He sits on His throne," "He has curly hair and black hair on His head," or 
"the Mighty One laughed." They strongly believed that God could and must not be 
portrayed in anthropomorphic terms. But rather than deny that God could be por- 
trayed in such terms, their solution was to identify the God of the Bible as an angel 
created by the First Creator. It was this angel who, in turn, created the world. 

Some of the most anthropomorphic passages about God occur in the Exodus nar- 
rative, such as Yahweh is a man of war (Exod. 15:3), Yahweh came down upon Mount Sinai, 
to the top of the mount (Exod. 19:20), and Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and 
Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and they saw the God of Israel ; and there was under 
His feet the likeness of a pavement of sapphire stone (Exod. 24:9-10). This portrayal of God 
is attributed by the Magharians to the pre-existent angel. The notion that God re- 
vealed the Law through an angel is found in The Book of Jubilees 1 :27 as well: "And God 
said to the angel of the presence: 'Write for Moses from the beginning of Creation till 
My sanctuary has been built among them for all eternity."' 

The angel of the Magharians is also identified with the Angel of the Lord, espe- 
cially as identified in the key passage from Exodus 23:20-21: "/ am sending an angel 
before you to guard you on the way and to bring you to the place that I have made ready. Pay 
heed to him, and obey him. Do not defy him, for he will not pardon your offenses, since My 
Name is in him." 

Although the angel myth of the Magharians originated out of reverence to God 
and their belief that God must not be portrayed in anthropomorphic terms, in the end 
they reduced the importance of God and raised up the importance of the angel, who 
was the true creator of this world. 

Philo's concept of the Logos, or some parallel traditions, which at times becomes 
identified as an angel, may have influenced the Magharian myth. 

This mythic solution later induced this sect to become Christian, in that they ac- 
cepted the idea that the creating angel had human form, and therefore could take the 
form of a human being. The founder of the sect, however, returned to Judaism, disil- 
lusioned by Christianity, and wrote two books attacking it. 

There are also reports about the Magharians in Shahrastani, where their name was 
corrupted into Makaribans. Here the angel is not pre-existent, but one of the minister- 
ing angels who is selected by God as his proxy. Otherwise the myths are the same.

THE WHEEL OF CREATION 121 


153. THE WHEEL OF CREATION 

All creation is a rotating wheel, revolving and alternating. Everything goes in cycles. 
Man becomes angel, and angel, man. Head becomes foot, and foot head. All these things 
have a single root. All interchange, raising the low, lowering the high, spinning on the 
wheel of creation. 

This myth demonstrates the unique vision of Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav. Here he 
describes a cyclic view of creation in which things are transformed into their opposites, 
men into angels and back again. This is what he identifies as the wheel of creation. One 
likely inspiration for this myth is Isaiah 40:4: Let every valley be raised and mount made 
low. Another is the famous passage from Ecclesiastes 3:1: To everything there is a season, 
and a time for every purpose under heaven.

154. THE COSMIC TREE 

In the beginning God planted a cosmic tree that reached from one end of the universe to 
the other. God planted this tree for the whole world, and everything that God created 
afterward emerged from this tree. All souls blossom from it, flying forth in joy. All things 
emanate from it. The whole world delights in it. Everything needs it and yearns for it, 
and seeks to glimpse that tree. And, at the end of their lives, the souls of the righteous 
ascend on high, attaching themselves to this tree. 

God was alone when He created the cosmic tree and sowed the seeds of All. None was 
with Him when he planted and rooted that tree, and there was none to whom He could 
confide this secret. That is why no angel can raise himself above it to say: "I was there first/' 

The cosmic tree described here functions both as a myth and as an allegory. This 
dual nature is commonly found in kabbalah, in which there is an ongoing dialectic 
between myth and allegory. The myth of a tree that is also the cosmos has astrological 
roots, while its allegorical aspect is the symbolic Tree of Life that is used to represent 
the sefirot, especially the final seven sefirot. The names of these sefirot are identified 
in the verse Yours, Lord, are the Greatness, the Strength, the Beauty, the Victory and the 
Splendor, for All in heaven and earth. Yours O God is the Kingdom (I Chron. 29:11). The 
sefirah Yesod, representing the sexual organ in man, is identified as the "All" that is the 
source of all souls, for through Yesod souls are transmitted. 

Sefer ha-Bahir discusses the cosmic tree in two passages, 22 and 119. In the latter the 
cosmic tree is defined: "What is this tree? The powers of God, one above the other, 
resembling a tree." Here too the metaphor of the tree is expanded, as follows: "lust as 
a tree brings forth fruit through water, God increases the power of the tree through 
water. What is the water of God? It is wisdom. It is the souls of the righteous. The 
Shekhinah dwells among them. Their deeds rest in the bosom of God, and He makes 
them fruitful and multiplies them." 

In Isaiah 44:24 God says, "It is I, Yahweh, who made everything, who stretched out the 
heavens alone and spread out the earth." This statement is intended to eliminate specula- 
tion that other forces, such as the angels, aided in Creation. Likewise, Genesis Rabbah 1:3 
states, "When were the angels created? All agree that none were created on the first day, 
lest you should say, Michael stretched the world in the south and Gabriel in the north, 
while God measured it in the middle." (Other sources, however, link the creation of the 
angels to the first day of Creation, and imply that the angels did participate in the sub- 
sequent creation. See "Creation By Angels," p. 116 and the accompanying note.) 

This sentiment is also found in this passage from Sefer ha-Bahir 22:11, where God 
takes complete credit for having created the cosmic tree, which is a metaphor for the

universe. This tree is the origin of the souls of the world. It does not seem to be iden- 
tical to the Tree of Life, although life emerges from it.

155. THE SHATTERING OF THE VESSELS AND THE 
GATHERING OF THE SPARKS 

At the beginning of time, God's presence filled the universe. Then God decided to bring 
this world into being. To make room for creation, God first drew in His breath, contract- 
ing Himself. From that contraction a dark mass was produced. And when God said. Let 
there be light (Gen. 1:3), the light that came into being entered the dark mass, and ten 
vessels came forth, each filled with primordial light. 

In this way God sent forth those ten vessels, like a fleet of ships, each carrying its cargo 
of light. Had they arrived intact, the world would have been perfect. But somehow the 
frail vessels broke open, split asunder, and all the holy sparks were scattered, like sand, 
like seeds, like stars. Those sparks fell everywhere, but more fell on the Holy Land than 
anywhere else. 

That is why we were created— to gather the sparks, no matter where they are hidden. 
Some even say that God created the world so that Israel could raise up the holy sparks. 
And that is why there have been so many exiles— to release the holy sparks from the 
servitude of captivity. For in this way the people of Israel will sift all the holy sparks from 
the four comers of the earth. 

And when enough holy sparks have been gathered, the vessels will be restored, and 
the repair of the world, awaited so long, will finally take place. Therefore it should be the 
aim of everyone to raise these sparks from wherever they are imprisoned and to elevate 
them to holiness by the power of their soul. And when the task of gathering the sparks 
nears completion, God will hasten the arrival of the final redemption by Himself collect- 
ing what remains of the holy sparks that went astray. 

The myth of the Shattering of the Vessels {shevirat ha-kelim), attributed to the Ari, is 
found in the writings of Hayim Vital, Moshe Yonah, Yosef ibn Tabul, and Israel Sarug, 
among others. Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, quoting Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 3, suggests 
that the reason that God wanted to create the earth was "to reveal his majesty, since 
there is no King without subjects. Therefore God constricted His infinite light, leaving a 
vacated space" ( Likutei Moharcm 6). See "The Contraction of God," p. 13. According to 
Hayim Vital, the ten vessels were created to contain ten gradations of divine light— the 
ten sefirot. See The Ten Sefirot," p. 7. In some versions of this myth, all ten vessels are 
said to have broken, while other versions insist that the upper three vessels remained 
intact, while the lower seven shattered. The breaking of the vessels indicates some kind 
of divine flaw, since the vessels were unable to hold the infinite light that flowed into 
them. It was the shattering of the vessels, the divine equivalent of the Fall of Adam 
and Eve, that permitted the roots of evil to enter the world. Once they shattered, the 
vessels, now called kelippot, meaning "shells" or "shards," and conceived as demonic 
in nature, became the basis of material reality. While most of the divine light ascended 
on high, some clung to the broken shards. These are the sparks that must be liberated 
through the process of Gathering the Sparks. As Rabbi Hayim Tirer of Chernovitz puts 
it, "The Jewish people must make a mighty effort to return these sparks to the Cre- 
ator" ( Be'er Mayim Hayim, Bereshit 32). 



THE WHEEL OF CREATION 123 


According to Israel Sarug (1631): "Traces of the divine light adhered to the frag- 
ments of the broken vessels like sparks. And when the fragments descended to the 
bottom of the fourth and last world, they produced the four elements, and when all 
these became completely materialized, some of the sparks still remained within. There- 
fore it should be the aim of everyone to raise these sparks from where they are impris- 
oned in this world and to elevate them to holiness by the power of their soul." 

There are three likely biblical sources for the Ari's myth. The first. Contraction 
(; tzimtzum ), finds its likely biblical source in the cloud that fills the Tent of Meeting: A 
cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the Presence ofYahweh filled the Tabernacle , and Moses 
was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting (Exod. 40:34-35). 

The second phase of the Ari's myth, the Shattering of the Vessels, has two likely 
biblical sources. The first is that of Moses throwing down the first tablets of the Law, 
which shatter: He became enraged ; and he hurled the tablets from his hand and shattered 
them at the foot of the mountain (Exod. 32:19). This is an important source, especially 
since there are ten commandments and ten sefirot. Equally relevant is the passage in 
Ezekiel 10:2 in which coals of fire from the altar are scattered by some angelic figure 
over the city of Jerusalem: Fill your hands with glowing coals from among the cherubs, and 
scatter them over the city. This passage from Ezekiel manages to work in the scattering, 
the sparks, the concentration of sparks on the Holy Land (and especially Jerusalem), 
and the holiness of the sparks, since they come from the altar. 

A deeply metaphoric passage in the Idra Rabbah portion of the Zohar (3:135a-135b) 
about the deaths of the kings of Edom (Gen. 36:31-39) has been linked to the sefirotic 
process of emanation, which is in turn linked to the myth of the Shattering of the Vessels, 
in that both describe a cosmic rupture. Interpreted in this fashion, this passage identifies 
the vessels that shattered with the myth of the prior worlds that God is said to have cre- 
ated and destroyed: "and all the worlds were destroyed." See "Prior Worlds," p. 71. These 
prior worlds were understood to have been flawed worlds that God created and destroyed. 
From this interpretation it is possible to conclude that the Breaking of the Vessels came 
about because of some kind of flaw whose origin must be tracked back to God. For if the 
vessels had been strong enough, or the light in them stable, they would have fulfilled 
their original purpose and arrived intact at their destination. Instead, the sparks of holy 
light must be liberated from the dark matter in which they have descended. 

The third stage, the Gathering of the Sparks, may well find its source in the gather- 
ing of the manna in the desert: The Israelites did so, some gathering much, some little 
(Exod. 16:17). Like the sparks, the manna has fallen from the heavens to nourish the 
people's bodies, while the sparks nourish their souls. 

Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Riminov strongly linked the myth of the Gathering of 
the Sparks with the messianic redemption: "These holy sparks descended at the time 
of Creation. It is our task to extract and cleanse the holy sparks by means of learning 
Torah and performing mitzvot. If Israel merits to elevate all the holy sparks through 
their good deeds, then, when this task is completed, God will hasten the arrival of the 
Final Redemption. For the Final Redemption cannot occur until all the holy sparks are 
purified and elevated to their origin. And what if there are a few holy sparks that were 
led astray? God will collect what is His — He Himself will collect the holy sparks that 
were led astray." Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Lyady confirms the link between raising up 
the fallen sparks and the arrival of the messianic era: "When all the sparks of holiness 
have been released, the Messiah will come" (Tanya 25). 

Note that the Riminov Rebbe adds a remarkable detail to the myth of Gathering 
the Sparks: that God Himself will collect any remaining holy sparks that went astray. 
The Riminov Rebbe links this interpretation to the talmudic dictim, "God is forebearing 
and collects what is His" (Y. Tan. 82a). 

In Esh Kadosh, Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira suggests that when there was an 
increase in the kelippot — the forces of evil — the deaths of the Ten Martyrs became nec- 
essary to prevent a new Shattering of the Vessels. Then Rabbi Shapira offers a parallel 
explanation for the loss of so many Jewish souls in the Shoah , concluding that it was 
also a time of the Breaking of the Vessels.

156. CREATION BY BROKEN VESSELS 

At the time of Creation, God created worlds and destroyed them. The worlds that were 

created and those that were destroyed were the shattered vessels that God had sent forth. 

Out of those broken vessels God created the present universe. 

Here Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira transforms Rabbi Isaac Luria's myth of 
the Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks, linking the Ari's myth to 
the midrash found in Genesis Rabbah 3:7 and elsewhere about God having destroyed 
many previous worlds prior to the creation of this one. In the midrash, God destroys 
the worlds because they don't please him — in some way they are imperfect. But here 
Rabbi Shapira has brilliantly transformed a myth about destruction into a myth about 
creation. Instead of the prior worlds simply having been destroyed, here they are un- 
derstood to have been the basis for the subsequent, present universe, known as olam 
ha-tikkun, world of repair. 

Although Rabbi Shapira 's reinterpretation of the Ari's myth is really a new myth in 
itself, it does not contradict the Ari's myth, where the Shattering of the Vessels, and 
the spilling of the primordial light inside them serves as the prelude to the Gathering 
of the Sparks, which is precisely tikkun olam— repair of the world. Thus the end result 
of the two versions is the same. From this perspective. Rabbi Shapira's myth might be 
seen as an alternate version of the Ari's myth, to which, of course, it directly refers. 

See "The Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks," p. 122. 

Rabbi Shapira viewed the Shattering of the Vessels as a cosmic shattering that could 
recur in another time. In Esh Kadosh, Rabbi Shapira presents the theory that such an 
event was averted because of the deaths of the Ten Martyrs. He also viewed the Holo- 
caust, which he experienced firsthand in the Warsaw Ghetto, as a time of the Breaking 
of the Vessels. But rather than simply view this as a time of cosmic catastrophe, he was 
true to his own myth, asserting instead that it was a time for renewal and new cre- 
ation. And for him the primary task of renewal was repentance. Only in this way 
could all the worlds be mended.

157. THE HEAVENLY MAN 

There are those who say that God did not only create one Adam, but two. The first Adam 
was a heavenly being who was not fashioned from clay, but was stamped with the like- 
ness and image of God, as it is said, in the image of God He created him (Gen. 1:27). This 
Adam assisted God in the creation of the earthly Adam. There is a vast difference be- 
tween this heavenly Adam, and the earthly Adam. 



THE CREATION OF MAN 125 


The earthly Adam was created out of the dust of the earth, as it is said. The Lord God 
formed man from the dust of the earth (Gen. 2:7). At the same time, Adam was brought to life 
by the breath of God, as it is said. He blew into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a 
living being (Gen. 2:7). Thus the earthly man was made from a composite of divine breath 
and a lump of clay. 

A vast difference exists between the heavenly man and the generations descended 
from the earthly Adam — although the earthly Adam has returned to the dust, the heav- 
enly Adam still exists. For the heavenly man, bom in the image of God, has no participa- 
tion in any earthlike essence, is imperishable, and is neither male nor female. 

Others, who disagree, say that this heavenly man was none other than Adam himself, 
for it was God's original intention for Adam to live forever, like the angels. That is the 
meaning of the verse " Now the man has become like one of us" (Gen. 3:22). For God intended 
to set up Adam as king over all His creatures. God said, "I am King of the worlds above, 
and Adam will be king in the worlds below." So God brought Adam into the Garden of 
Eden and made him king there. 

Still others say that both the heavenly man and the earthly man were introduced into 
Paradise together, the heavenly man in the heavenly Garden and the earthly man in the 
earthly Garden. Yet while the heavenly man still makes his home on high, the earthly 
man was cast out of the Garden long ago. For God's intentions for Adam came to naught 
when Adam ate from the forbidden fruit, and at that moment mortality was decreed to 
him. But if Adam had not sinned, he would have endured forever. 

Others concur that two Adams were created, but they say that one is for this world, 
and one for the World to Come. However, the creation of the second Adam will not be 
completed until the time of the resurrection of the dead at the End of Days. 

The notion that there were two Adams, one heavenly and one earthly, is reflected 
in Philo's explanation of the apparent contradiction in the two creation texts found in 
Genesis 1:27 and Genesis 2:7. The earlier creation of man in Genesis was understood 
by Philo to be a heavenly man because he was created in the image of God (Gen. 1:27), 
while it is clearly stated that the earthly Adam was formed from the dust of the earth 
(Gen. 2:7), consisting of body and soul, and therefore human. Philo describes this 
heavenly man as "an idea, or a type, or a seal, perceptible only by the intellect, incor- 
poreal, neither male nor female, imperishable by nature" ( De Opificio Mundi 134). 

This heavenly man is known by several names, including the "Heavenly Man," the 
"First Man," and the "Light Man." It appears that in certain mystical circles the Heav- 
enly Man and Adam merged into a single figure. Philo calls him "God's Firstborn." In 
the Nag Hammadi texts, such as The Gospel of the Egyptians , he is known as Adamas. In 
later kabbalistic texts this figure seems to evolve into Adam Kadmon. In all cases he is 
portrayed either as a transcendent being created by God before the creation of the 
human Adam — or else he was the original incarnation of Adam, when it was God's 
intention that he be immortal. 

The myth that God created two Adams, one for the heavenly garden and one for the 
earthly garden, grows out of the dual understanding of the term Gan Eden , literally, the 
Garden of Eden. While the use of this term in Genesis seems to clearly indicate an earthly 
garden, it later acquired the meaning of "Paradise," and it is the term used to indicate 
Paradise in rabbinic literature. The explanation that God created two Adams and placed 
each of them in Gan Eden resolves the question of whether Adam's Paradise was on 
earth or in heaven by asserting that there was an Adam both above and below. 

The idea that God intended to make Adam the ruler of the world derives from the 
verse The Lord God planted a garden in Eden , in the east , and placed there the man whom He 
had formed (Gen. 2:8). The phrase "placed there the man" is interpreted to indicate 
Adam's kingship. 

Philo's concept of the Heavenly Man is based on his interpretation of the verse And 
God created man in His image (Gen. 1:27). Philo believed that something made in God's 



126 MYTHS OF CREATION 


image must be very much like its Creator, far transcendent to human beings. Thus, 
from his point of view, the figure created in Genesis 1:27 was not the same as the man 
created in Genesis 2:7. Philo identifies the transcendent figure as the Heavenly Man, 
as God's invisible image, and as God's Logos, identifying the Logos as the "eldest- 
born Image of God ( De Confusione Linguarum 62-63). Thus, for Philo, the earthly man 
was made after the image of the Heavenly Man. But as is often the case in Philo's 
writings, the meaning of "Logos" seems to veer between a philosophical and a mytho- 
logical concept. In other places, Philo identifies the heavenly man with the soul, and 
the earthly man with the body. Philo also identifies three types of men: the earth-born, 
the heaven-bom, and the God-bom. The earth-born chase after pleasures of the body; 
the heaven-bom are artists and lovers of learning; the God-bom are priests and prophets 
who have transcended earthly concerns (De Gigantibus 12:58-61). 

Ultimately, the role of the heavenly man resembles that of a second divine figure. 
Rather than acknowledge dualism, the heavenly man was designated to serve a sec- 
ondary role, greater than that of the angels, but less than his Creator. In some myths, 
his role is to rule over the creatures of this world; in others, he seems primarily to exist 
as an archetype of humanity. In some of the Gnostic literature, the celestial Adam 
does play an active role, bringing the chaotic matter to rest, rotating the universe in a 
circle, and releasing the world ocean that surrounds the universe. 

Midrash Tanhuma offers another version of the myth of the two Adams, stating that 
one Adam was created for this world, and one for the World to Come. The second 
Adam, in this view, is the Messiah, whose coming will herald the End of Days. This 
coincides with the myth that the Messiah is a heavenly figure, who lives in his own 
mystical palace. This is contradicted by the tradition that the Messiah will be a human 
being. The Lubavitch Hasidim combined these two myths into one, saying that the 
divine soul of the Messiah would descend into a human body. They believed (and 
many still believe) that this was the body of their late Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel 
Schneersohn (1902-1993). In effect, they combined two contradictory myths into one.

158. ADAM THE ANGEL 

God created Adam from invisible and visible substances, and assigned him to be an angel, 
second in power, who would share His wisdom. And God assigned him to be a great and 
glorious king, who would reign on earth. There was nothing comparable to him on earth, 
among any other creatures that existed. And God assigned him four special stars and 
called his name Adam. And God handed over Paradise to Adam, and commanded him 
to peer into the heavens, so that he might look upon the angels. 

In this version of the theme of the heavenly Adam, found in 2 Enoch , Adam is 
described as an angel. Just as Enoch and Jacob are portrayed as demiurgic angels, 
second in command to God, so too was there such a tradition about Adam, although 
there are strong Gnostic echoes in this Adam myth. See "The Metamorphosis and

159. ADAM THE GOLEM 

When God decided to create Adam, He gathered dust from the four comers of the earth, 
rolled it together, mixed it with water, and made red clay. Then God shaped the clay into 
a lifeless body, the first golem, stretching from one end of the world to the other, and 
brought it to life. So large was it, that God's hand rested upon it. So large was it, that 
wherever God looked. He saw it. That is the meaning of the verse Your eyes saw my golem 
(Ps. 139:16). So huge was it, that the angels mistook it for God Himself, and they wanted 
to say "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts." So God caused sleep to fall upon him, so 
that all knew he was but a mortal man. 

While the golem of Adam lay sleeping, God whispered in his ear the secrets of Cre- 
ation, and showed Adam the righteous of every generation, and the wicked as well, until 
the time when the dead will be raised. Indeed, God showed him every righteous man 
who would ever descend from him, every generation and its judges, scribes, prophets, 
and leaders. So too did God show him every generation and its saints and sinners. And 
as God spoke, Adam witnessed everything as if he were there. Some of the righteous 
hung on Adam's head, some hung to his hair, some to his forehead, some to his eyes, 
some to his nose, some to his mouth, some to his ears, some to his teeth. 

And later, when Adam did come to life, he dimly remembered all that God had re- 
vealed when he was only a golem. And at night, in his dreams, he still heard God's voice 
recounting mysteries, and telling of all that would take place in the days to come. In 
those dreams Adam would travel to those places and see the events firsthand, as a wit- 
ness. And since there is a spark of Adam's soul in every one of his descendants, there are 
a few in every generation who still hear the voice of God in their dreams. 

"Golem" means "a formless body." In shaping Adam's body out of clay, God created 
the first golem. There are stories in the Talmud and medieval Jewish lore that describe 
the creation of golems, one a calf that was eaten on the Sabbath, one a man of clay 
animated by the fourth century Rabbi Rava, and one a woman golem that Ibn Gabirol is 
said to have made out of wood. Later the famous legend of the golem of the Maharal 
recounted how he created a man out of clay in much the same way that God did, using 
the powers of what is known as practical kabbalah. The fact that the golem of the Maharal 
is mute and cannot reproduce demonstrates that man's creation is less perfect than God's. 

It also demonstrates man's desire to take on the powers of God and act in a godlike 
fashion. The righteous who cling to the golem of Adam represent the qualities that each 
of the righteous emphasized. See "The Golem of Prague," p. 281. 

According to Midrash ha-Ne'elam, Zohar Hadash 17c-d, God gathered the dust for 
Adam's body from the site where the Temple in Jerusalem would be built in the fu- 
ture, and drew down his soul from the celestial Temple. 

One of the important questions about the creation of Adam asks whether God cre- 
ated Adam by Himself, or if the angels played a role in his creation. Many midrashim 
describe Gabriel's role in gathering dust from the four comers of the earth. In contrast, 

4 Ezra insists that God created Adam entirely by Himself: "Adam was the workmanship 
of Your hands, and You breathed into him the breath of life, and he was made alive in 
Your presence. And You led him into the garden which Your right hand had planted 
before the earth appeared" (4 Ezra 3:4-6).

160 . ADAM THE GIANT 

When Adam was first created, he was as tall as the distance from the earth to heaven, big 
enough to fill the world from east to west or from north to south. His two eyeballs were 
like globes of the sun. He even filled the hollow places of the world. The radiance of his 
face was unchanged, and its lights were not eclipsed until the Sabbath ended. And he 
was as strong and powerful as the mighty ones on high. This first Adam knew more of 
the supernal wisdom than the angels above, and his union with God was closer than 
with any other beings in the universe. 

When the angels saw him, they trembled and fled. Then they all came before God and 
said, "Master of the Universe! Are there to be two powers in the world, one in heaven and 
the other on earth? Then God placed His hand upon Adam and reduced his size until he 
was no more than a hundred cubits tall, and all the springs of wisdom were closed to him. 

The myth of the giant Adam is found in the midrashic literature. Later, it likely 
served as one of the sources in the kabbalistic literature for the myth of Adam Kadmon. 

See "Adam Kadmon," p. 15. The biblical sources for the concept of a giant Adam are: 

God created man on earth, from one end of heaven to the other (Deut. 4:32), You have formed 
me from west and east (Ps. 139:5), and. Your eyes saw my golem (Ps. 139:16). The first 
Adam is portrayed as a giant figure, half man, half god.‘ There is also a myth of the 
first Eve, who is sometimes identified with Lilith, but also has an independent exist- 
ence apart from Lilith. See "The First Eve," p. 140. 

Zohar 3:107b adds the interesting detail that when the creatures in the Garden of 
Eden saw Adam prostrate himself before the Tree of Knowledge, all of them followed 
his lead, and this sin, rather than the eating of the forbidden fruit, was the cause of his 
death and the introduction of death into the world. 

According to Sefer Hasidim, when the angels first saw the giant Adam, they wanted 
to worship him. But after he sinned, God diminished him and piled pieces of his limbs 
around him. Adam said to God, Does it benefit You to defraud, to despise the toil of Your 
hands? (Job 10:3). God told Adam to scatter the pieces of his limbs throughout the 
world and plant them, and his offspring will settle in those places. But no Jews would 
live in any of the places where he did not plant any pieces of his flesh. This closely 
resembles the Greek myth of Cadmus. See Graves, Greek Myths 58.g. 

The shrinking of the giant Adam to human size is explained by the verse You hedge 
me before and behind; You lay Your hand upon me (Ps. 139:5). Since it is well known that 
God fashioned Adam out of the dust of the earth, the second part of the verse and laid 
Your hand upon me, suggests that it was God who caused the man to shrink from his 
celestial proportions.

THE CREATION OF MAN 129 


161. ADAM THE LAST AND FIRST 

When God wished to create the world. His first work of Creation was none other than 
Adam. First God made a lifeless body. But when He was about to instill a soul in him, 
God said, "If I finish his creation now, he will claim that he was My partner in the work 
of Creation. Therefore I shall leave him as a lifeless body until I create everything." 

When God had completed everything else, the angels said to Him: "Are You going to 
make man, as You said you would?" God answered: "I have already made him, and all 
he lacks is the infusion of a soul. When he receives this, he will reign on the earth, and 
there will be nothing comparable to him, even among the other creatures that exist. I will 
call his name Adam." 

So God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul (Gen. 
2:7). That is why it is said that Adam was the last and first, for God began and completed 
the creation of the world with him, as it is said. Last and first You did form me (Ps. 139:5). 

This myth is a polemic about the traditions that indicate that God shared some of 
the work of creation with a heavenly Adam. Since this implies Gnostic duality and 
threatens monotheism, the present myth is offered as an antidote. It says that yes, 
Adam was God's first creation, but only his lifeless body. God held off giving him a 
soul until the sixth day, as is stated in Genesis 2:7: Then God formed man of the dust of the 
ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul 

This myth serves to prove that Adam was not God's partner in Creation. This is 
stated explicitly in B. Sanhedrin 38a: "Adam was created last on the eve of the Sabbath. 

Why? Lest the heretics should say, 'God has a partner in the work of Creation.'" Here, 
as in the other passages, the phrase "lest the heretics should say" indicates that there 
were those who did say such things. Because the existence of such a partner for God 
would dispute monotheism, those who argued for such a partner are regarded as 
heretics — minim. In this case it is likely that the heretics the rabbis had in mind were 
the Gnostics, who taught that everything came into being through Adam. A similar 
tradition about Adam is found in 2 Enoch 30:11-12, where God says, "I assigned him 
(Adam) to be a second angel, honored and glorious. I assigned him to be a king, to 
reign on earth and to have My wisdom. There was nothing comparable to him, not 
even among the angels." 

The Testament of Abraham, chapter 8 (rec. B) goes even further, describing Adam as 
sitting upon a throne of glory at the gates of Paradise, surrounded by angels. Later, in 
the same text, Adam is described as "adorned in glory, with a terrifying appearance, 
like that of the Lord" (chapter 11, rec. A.) Here Adam clearly plays a demiurgic role. 

"Adam the Last and First" alerts us to an entire category of polemical myths. A 
classic example of such a myth is the talmudic account of Elisha ben Abuyah's vision 
of Metatron. Here Elisha was said to have seen Metatron seated on a heavenly throne. 

Since he had understood that there was no sitting in heaven other than for God, he 
announces, "There must be two powers in heaven" (B. Hagigah 15a). The intention of 
this myth is clear: to undermine the extensive myths about Enoch /Metatron, demon- 
strating that such belief in Metatron as the Prince of the Presence, the second in com- 
mand after God, would endanger belief in monotheism. Here it causes Elisha to become 
an apostate, thereafter known as Aher , "the Other." See "A Vision of Metatron," p. 174. 

Another example of a polemical myth is that of the homunculus of Maimonides, 
probably created by the opponents of Maimonides in the anti-Maimonidian contro- 
versy. See "The Homunculus of Maimonides," p. 284. 

See also "The Image of Jacob Cast Out of Heaven," p. 368 for a third example of a 
polemical myth. This is a polemic against the myths that raise Jacob from a human to 



130 MYTHS OF CREATION 


a heavenly figure, another example of the First Created Being. This myth has God cast 
Jacob's image, which was on God's throne, out of heaven.

162 . ADAM'S BODY OF LIGHT 

Adam possessed a body of light, which shone from one end of the world to the other. 
This light was identical with the primordial light that was created on the first day. So 
bright was this light that Adam's heel outshone the globe of the sun; how much more so 
the brightness of his face. So astonishing was the sight of Adam that the ministering 
angels became confused, and mistook him for a divine being, and wished to proclaim 
him as Cod. So God caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep, and then all the angels knew 
he was but a man. 

The splendor of Adam's face was only one of seven precious gifts that God gave to 
Adam before the Fall. Some of the others were eternal life, tallness of stature, the fruit of the 
soil, the fruit of the trees, the luminaries in the sky, the light of the moon, and the light of the 
sun. The reason that Adam's face shone so brightly is that God created Adam in His own image 
(Gen. 1:27). So brightly did his face shine that the angels mistook him for God himself. So 
God put him into a deep sleep, and the angels realized he was no more than a man. 

Some say that one of the consequences of Adam's sin was that the light of Adam's 
body was diminished, along with his cosmic size. When this brightness vanished, he 
appeared naked. Others insist that even after his death Adam retained his radiant coun- 
tenance. Still others say that Adam did not receive the light that surrounded his body 
until after he sinned and repented, and that is when God gave him a garment of light. 

Now it was Rabbi Bana'ah's duty to measure burial caves, and once he came upon the 
cave in which Adam was buried. There he discerned that each of Adam's heels eclipsed 
the sun. And he understood that if Adam's heel outshone the sun, the radiance of his face 
must have eclipsed it even more so. But before he could enter any further, a voice came 
forth, which said: "You have beheld the likeness of My likeness, but My likeness itself 
you may not behold." 

After Adam and Eve sinned by eating the forbidden fruit, they perceived that they 
were naked (Gen. 3:7). Some midrashim assert that they had been surrounded by clouds 
of glory, which departed after their sin. See "The Garments of Adam and Eve," p. 437. 

This myth about Adam's body of light is a variation on the theme of clouds of glory. 

Here, instead of the clouds, Adam is said to be surrounded by the primordial light. 

See "The Light of the First Day," p. 83. This light disappears after Adam's sin. This 
myth is also a variant on the theme of Adam as demiurge, in that, surrounded by that 
light, the angels mistook him for a divine being. 

The extensive tradition about Adam's body of light seems intended to create a 
bridge between the myths about a heavenly Adam who has a demiurgic role, and the 
earthly Adam created out of dust by God. This myth links both Adams into a single 
being, who loses his divine nature when he eats the forbidden fruit. For more on the 
demiurgic Adam, see "The Heavenly Man," p. 124 and "Adam Kadmon," p. 15.

163. THE ENTHRONEMENT OF ADAM 

The archangel Michael descended to earth and took Abraham on a chariot pulled by 
cherubim and brought him up into heaven. That chariot soared over the entire world, 
and Abraham beheld all that took place that day in the lives of men, both good and evil. 
He saw births, wedding processions, and the dead being borne to their tombs. 

Then the chariot reached the first gate of heaven. There Abraham saw that there were 
two paths, one broad and one straight and narrow. And they saw many souls driven by 
angels through the broad gate, and a few other souls led by angels through the narrow 
gate. And outside the two gates they saw a man seated on a golden throne, adorned in 
glory. And when the man on the throne saw the many souls driven through the broad 
gate, he threw himself on the ground and wept and grieved. But when he saw the souls 
entering through the straight gate, he rejoiced and exulted. 

Seeing this, Abraham asked the angel Michael who that wondrous man was, and 
Michael told him that it was Adam, the first to be formed, who was enthroned there. He 
observes the world and all those who live there, since everyone has descended from him. 
And when he sees souls entering through the gate of the righteous, which leads to life, he 
rejoices. But when he sees all those who enter by the gate of the sinners, which leads to 
destruction, he weeps and wails. 

This myth about Adam being seated on a golden throne in heaven comes out of a 
tradition that elevated Adam to the status of a divine being. This myth also belongs to 
the tradition of other enthronement myths, such as those about Enoch, Jacob, Moses, 
and King David that are found in a variety of sources, especially the Pseudepigrapha. 

In a variety of myths, Adam is portrayed as a divine figure. In some he is described 
as a giant reaching from earth to heaven. See "Adam the Giant," p. 128. In others he is 
described as an enormous golem, as big as this world, asleep in paradise. See "Adam 
the Golem," p. 127. Here, Adam is portrayed as a figure seated on a golden throne 
who either rejoices at the fate of righteous souls who enter paradise, or mourns over 
the fate of those souls driven away from a heavenly reward. Adam's great concern for 
them grows out of his role as their ancestor, the first man. Indeed, he regards them all 
as his children. 

Underlying this enthronement myth is the view that Adam must be regarded as a 
divine figure, who shares the duties of ruling the world with God. It is evidence of the 
survival of Jewish Gnosticism, primarily in the texts of the Pseudepigrapha, as here, 
from The Testament of Abraham.

164. ADAM'S BODY FORMED BY AN ANGEL 

When the time came for the first man to be created, God called upon the angel Michael, 
and ordered him to form Adam from the dust of the earth. First Michael gathered dust 
from the four comers of the earth — though some say that the dust came from the Holy 



132 MYTHS OF CREATION 


Land, from the place where the altar of the Temple would one day be built. Then Michael 
shaped him into a clay figure in the image of God, as it is said. In the image of God he created 
him (Gen. 1:27). God then breathed into the clay figure a soul from the Heavenly Temple, 
and Adam opened his eyes. 

The notion that someone other than God gathered the dust from which Adam was 
created finds its source in the verse Make for me an altar of earth (Exod. 20:21). In some 
versions (such as Midrash Konen), it is Gabriel, rather than Michael, who is sent to 
gather the dust. One midrash holds that the earth refused Gabriel, so that God reached 
out and gathered the dust from the four comers of the earth Himself. In other ver- 
sions, such as Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 12, it is said that God took the dust from which He 
created Adam from the site of the Temple, as this was a holy and pure place, or that 
Adam's bones were created there. Other sources say that Adam's body came from 
Babylon, his head from the Land of Israel, and his limbs from the other lands. 

Some sources, such as 4 Ezra 3:4, emphatically deny that God was assisted in the 
creation of the world or of man: "O Lord, did You not speak when You created earth, 
which You did without help, and command the dust, so that it gave You Adam?" In 
Against Apion 2:192, Josephus makes a similar point: "God created the world and its 
contents not with hands, not with toil, and not with assistants, for He had no need of 
them. He willed it into existence." 

Michael's forming the body of Adam by himself is parallel to Prometheus forming 
man out of clay and water. See Graves, The Greek Myths , 4c and 4.3. Graves calls the 
archangel Michael the counterpart of Prometheus. The Prometheus myth also finds a 
parallel in Judaism in the myth about Adam stealing light from heaven and bringing 
it to earth. See "Adam Brings Down Fire from Heaven," p. 137.

165. GOD CONSULTS THE ANGELS ABOUT 
THE CREATION OF ADAM 

When God wished to create man. He first created a company of ministering angels and 
said to them: "Shall we make man in our image?" 

They asked, "Master of the Universe, what will be his character?" 

God replied, "Righteous descendants will come forth from him." But He did not re- 
port to them that wicked descendants would come forth as well. 

They answered, "Master of the Universe, what will his deeds be?" 

God recounted their deeds, and the angels exclaimed, " What is man that You have been 
mindful of him, mortal man that You have taken note of him?" (Ps. 8:5). 

Thereupon, God stretched out His little finger among them and consumed them with 
fire. The same thing happened with the second group of angels. 

When God consulted with the third company of angels, they replied, "Master of the 
Universe, what did the other angels accomplish when they spoke to You as they did? The 
whole world is Yours, and whatever You wish to do with your world, You can do it." 

Others say that the angels formed parties and sects over the question of whether man 
should be created. Some called for him to be created, others for him not to be created. 



THE CREATION OF MAN 133 


While the angels were engaged in contentious arguments with each other, God went 
ahead and created man. Then God said to the angels, "What good are you doing? Man 
has already been made!" 

God created all that is above and below, yet here, when it comes to creating man. 

He takes counsel with the ministering angels. In one version of this myth, God de- 
stroys the angels as soon as they raise objections. So by the time He has created a third 
company of angels, they realize that there is no point in contradicting God, and point 
out, "The whole world is Yours, and whatever You wish to do with Your world. You 
can do it." In another version, the angels become pre-occupied with contentious argu- 
ments about whether or not man should be created. In the meantime, God simply 
ignores them and proceeds with the creation, telling them after the fact that man has 
already been created. Both versions make the same point: even though God may con- 
sult with the angels, in the end He will do as He wishes. Note that this midrash re- 
solves the problem of the use of the plural in Genesis 1:26, Let us make man in our image 
by suggesting that God took counsel with the angels before creating man. 

In 3 Enoch , the angels object to the elevation of Enoch in much the same terms as 
they object to the creation of man, and as they object to the ascent of Moses into heaven. 

See "The Ascent of Moses," p. 261.

166. THE CREATION OF MAN 

Such is the story of heaven and earth when they were created. When the Lord God made 
earth and heaven — when no shrub of the field was yet on earth and no grasses of the 
field had yet sprouted, because the Lord God had not sent rain upon the earth and there 
was no man to till the soil, but a flow would well up from the ground and water the 
whole surface of the earth— the Lord God formed man from the dust of the earth. He 
blew into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living being. 

Some midrashim say that God sent the angel Michael (or Gabriel) to gather the 
earth from which Adam was to be made from each of the four comers of the world, so 
that people could be buried anywhere, without the earth objecting that he had not 
come from that place. Another interpretation is found in Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 12, 
where it is said that God took Adam's dust from a pure place, the place of the Temple. 

Nachmanides, in Perush Ramban al ha-Torah on Genesis 1:26, identifies two stages in 
which Adam received his soul. First God placed a life force {nefesh) within him. Later, 

God breathed a higher soul (neshamah) into him. 

Parallels to the biblical account of the creation of man are found in the Mesopotamian 
myths of Atrahasis, the Enuma Elish, and the epic of Gilgamesh. In the stories of 
Atrahasis, humans were created by Mami, the mother goddess, with the help of the 
god Ea, out of clay mixed with the blood of the slain god Geshtu-e. A similar myth is 
found in Enuma Elish, in which the god Marduk, with the help of Ea, created mankind 
using the blood of Qingu, slain leader of the enemy gods. In Gilgamesh , Enkidu is 
parallel to Adam and Dilmun is parallel to Eden. To civilize the savage Enkidu, a 
woman is sent to be his companion, who seduces him for six days and seven nights, 
and turns him into a civilized man.

167. CREATION FROM A MOLD 

Adam was not created by God's pronouncement, as were other creations, but with God's 
own hands, as it is said. You lay Your Hand upon me (Ps. 139:5). Indeed, Adam was created 
by a mold that was made especially for him. This is the meaning of And God created man 
in his image (Gen. 1:27). 

Some say that God created this mold when He said, " Let us make man in our image" 
(Gen. 1:26). Others say that God used the mold of the angels, who also walk erect, since, 
in any case, God does not have an image or form. 

Everything made with a human mold is identical. But such is God's power that although 
each person is created with the same mold used for the first man, no two are alike. 

Genesis 1:27 is usually translated And God created man in His image, but here the 
word tzelem, usually translated as "image," is understood to mean "mold." This myth 
explains how it is that all humans beings seem to be made in the same mold. The mold 
can also be understood as an archetype, and Adam, as the first human being, is the 
archetype of all subsequent humans. Nevertheless, no two people are alike. 

The myth also raises the possibility that God used the mold with which he created 
the angels to create humans. This follows the tradition that humans and angels have 
similar forms. 

Finally, the myth emphasizes that while angels and humans may have been cre- 
ated from a mold, God does not have an image or form.

168. WISDOM CREATED MAN 

When God decided to create man. He assigned a share of the work to Wisdom, as it is 
said, "Let us make man" (Gen. 1:6). Why did God do this? So that man's rightful actions 
might be attributed to God, but his sins to others. For it was not fitting that the road to 
wickedness should be God's making. Therefore, on the sixth day God commanded Wis- 
dom to create man. 

Wisdom is said to have been one of God's earliest creations, as stated in Proverbs 
3:19: Yahweh founded the earth by Wisdom (Prov. 3:19). In most traditions this personifi- 
cation of Wisdom simply serves as a witness of God's subsequent creations, to testify 
that no others were involved. But here God assigns Wisdom the task of creating hu- 
man beings. Wisdom of Solomon states that "By Your wisdom You have formed man." 

Of course, the term "wisdom" can refer both to God's wisdom and to the mythical 
figure of Wisdom, but it seems clear in these sources— 2 Enoch, Wisdom of Solomon, and 



THE CREATION OF MAN 135 


Philo's De Confusione Linguarum — that the term "wisdom" is intended to refer to the 
mythical figure. See "The Creation of Wisdom," p. 45. Other sources attribute the "us" 
of " Let us make man" to the angels, and there are traditions about the role the angels 
such as Michael or Gabriel played in assisting God in the creation of man. See 
"Adam's Body Formed by an Angel," p. 131. It is interesting to note that in some 
Christian interpretations of " Let us make man" God is believed to have been ad- 
dressing the Son of God, and the work of Creation was a collaboration in which the 
Father commanded it be done, but it was the Son who carried it out ( Hymns of Faith 
6:13 by Ephraem).

169. ADAM'S CHOICE 

Before God created Adam, there were two formations, that of the celestial creatures and 
that of the earthly creatures. The angels and other celestial beings were created in the 
image of God, but they did not reproduce, while the animals and other earthly beings 
reproduced, but they were not created in the image of God. God decided that man would 
be created in His image, like the celestial beings, but that he would also reproduce, like 
the terrestrial beings. 

God said, "If I create man out of celestial elements, he will live forever. And if I create 
him out of terrestrial elements, his life will be brief. Therefore I will create him out of both 
celestial and terrestrial elements. The choice will be his: if he sins, he will die; if he does 
not sin, he will be immortal." 

This myth presents God debating with Himself about whether Adam and all sub- 
sequent human beings should share the characteristics of the celestial beings, espe- 
cially their immortality, or those of the terrestrial beings, in particular, their inevitable 
mortality. God decides to leave the choice to Adam, thus setting the stage for the di- 
vine test that takes place in the Garden of Eden, where God tells Adam that he may eat 
of any trees in the garden except for the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and 
Evil. Since Adam and Eve eat the forbidden fruit, they unknowingly lose their chance 
to have eternal life. Thus this myth supplies the missing explanation of God's inten- 
tion in commanding Adam to avoid eating from the Tree of Knowledge. 

Genesis Rabbah 14:3 explains that human beings share four characteristics with the 
celestial beings: they were created in the image of God, they stand upright, they speak 
and understand, and they have peripheral vision. Likewise, humans share four char- 
acteristics with animals: they eat and drink, they procreate, they excrete, and they die. 

Thus humans share characteristics with both the celestial and terrestrial beings. This 
explains the proverb that humans are a little lower than the angels.

170. ADAM'S BREATH 

On the first day God created heaven and earth. Five days were left over. He created 
above and below on alternate days. On the second day He created the firmament above, 
while on the third day He divided the waters above from the waters below. On the fourth 
day He created the sun, the moon and the stars above, while on the fifth day He gathered 



136 MYTHS OF CREATION 


the waters below. The sixth day remained for creating. Then God said: "If I create above, 
the earth will be angry, but if I create below, the heavens will be angry." What did God 
do? He created Adam in the world below, using breath from above. 

The purpose of this myth is to demonstrate that God was evenhanded in Creation, 
alternating between creating above and creating below, so as not to anger either the 
heavens or the earth. Finally, when it was time to create Adam, He drew on elements 
from above — breath — and below — earth — in order to create him.

On each of the first five days of Creation, God created three kinds of creatures. But on the 
sixth day, the day before the Sabbath, He was occupied the entire day with the making of 
Adam. 

These were the first twelve hours of Adam's life: In the first hour, Adam came into 
being as a thought. In the second hour, God consulted the ministering angels concerning 
him. In the third hour, God gathered the dust out of which He was to make Adam. In the 
fourth hour, God kneaded the dust. In the fifth, God shaped the dust into the shape of a 
man. In the sixth, God stood him on his feet, and he reached from earth to heaven. In the 
seventh hour God blew the breath of life into him. In the eighth, God brought him into 
the Garden of Eden. In the ninth hour, God told him that he could eat of the fruit of any 
tree in the Garden except for the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. In the tenth hour Adam 
sinned. In the eleventh hour, he was brought to justice. In the twelfth, the verdict was 
given and he was expelled from the Garden of Eden. 

Here Adam's life in the Garden of Eden is presented as having taken place in twelve 
hours, from the time he was created until the time he was expelled from Eden. Midrash 
Tehillim states that Adam was only saved from destruction in Gehenna by the plea of 
the Sabbath, which brought about his expulsion instead. 

There are alternate versions of this myth about Adam's creation. According to B. 
Sanhedrin 38b, Adam's dust was gathered in the first hour. In the second hour it was 
kneaded into a shapeless mass. In the third hour its limbs were shaped. In the fourth, 
a soul was infused into that clay body and he came to life. In the fifth, he arose and 
stood on his feet. In the sixth, he named the animals. In the seventh, Eve became his 
mate. In the eighth, Adam and Eve lay down together as two and arose as four, for 
Cain and Abel were conceived. (Others say that two lay down together and seven 
arose: Cain and his twin sister, and Abel and his two twin sisters.) In the ninth, Adam 
was commanded not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge. In the tenth, he sinned. In the 
eleventh, he was tried. In the twelfth hour he was expelled from Eden. There are nu- 
merous variants of this myth. Leviticus Rabbah, for example, explains that Adam was 
judged in the eleventh hour and pardoned in the twelfth. 

Why were these events collapsed into a 12-hour myth? It is possible that the hours 
are God's hours, each of which would be years for a human, just as a year of God is said 
to consist of a thousand human years. On the other hand, it is possible to see these 12 
hours as collapsed time, where everything that happens to Adam, from his creation to 
his expulsion, was driven by some powerful force well beyond his understanding.

THE CREATION OF MAN 137 


172. ADAM BRINGS DOWN FIRE FROM HEAVEN 

Some say that before Adam existed as a mortal, he lived in heaven, and that he not only 
brought down fire from heaven, but he brought down light as well. 

When Adam took the fire from heaven and descended with it, the whole sky was filled 
with fire, as if it were descending to set the world ablaze. At that moment, God signed a 
decree with His seal, relinquishing control of fire in the world, as it is said, "My word is 
like fire" (Jer. 23:29). 

As for the light that Adam brought down from on high, some say that the light shone 
from Adam's fingernails, which reflected brighter than the sun. 

Others say that Adam used the four winds of the world to bring down the light. 

Still others say that Adam used enchanted stones to bring light into the world. One 
was the stone of darkness, and the other, the stone of dimness, as it is said. The stones of 
thick darkness and the shadow of death (Job 28:3). From this we learn, though how is a mys- 
tery, that using darkness and death, Adam brought light into the world. 

This is an explicitly Jewish Promethean myth, with Adam playing the role of 
Prometheus. Just as Prometheus lit a torch from the fiery chariot of the sun and gave 
the fire to mankind as an act of rebellion against heaven, here Adam is not only cred- 
ited for having brought fire to earth, but also for having brought light. This addition 
gives Adam the status of a divine figure, perhaps even a demiurgic one. After all, 
bringing light into the world is a God-like act, since it is God who says " Let there be 
light" (Gen. 1:3). It might even appear that this myth had taken the myth of Prometheus 
and expanded it, adding light. For more on the myth of Prometheus giving fire to 
mankind, see Graves, The Greek Myths , 39g. 

Like Prometheus, Adam is portrayed in this myth as a divine figure, a heavenly 
being. Both of them steal fire from heaven and give it to mankind. While Prometheus 
lights a torch at the fiery chariot of the sun and gives mankind a glowing coal, Adam 
brings down a metaphorical fire, linked to God's word by the verse My word is like fire 
(Jer. 23:29). In this regard, Adam's gift of fire is parallel to Moses receiving the gift of 
the Torah from God at Mount Sinai. 

Is Adam's act in bringing down fire and light from heaven an act of rebellion as 
was that of Prometheus? It might be seen as another version of the Fall. Here, instead 
of eating the forbidden fruit, the cosmic Adam took fire and light from heaven. This 
interpretation is supported by Genesis 3:9: " Behold , the man has become like one of us, 
knowing good and bad. " In this context, Adam's sin and the forces that it released into 
the world are parallel to stealing the fire and light of heaven. 

The motif of Adam using his fingernails to bring down light from heaven is quite 
striking. It seems like an intentional reference to the Havdalah custom of turning one's 
fingernails toward a flame so that the light reflects in them. The implication is that 
there was enough light reflected from Adam's fingernails — which had been exposed 
to the light of heaven — to illumine the world. 

One obscure myth indicates that Adam brought light into the world by using the 
stones of darkness and the stones of dimness. This myth is derived from the verse in 
Job 28:3, The stones of thick darkness and the shadow of death. It seems to imply that light 
was created out of darkness and death. It also seems to imply that night was created 
out of darkness and death. 

Another Jewish Promethean myth is found in the interpretations of Genesis 6 about 
the sons of God and the daughters of men. This is read as an account of angels who 
descended to earth, promising God to be righteous, and instead chased after the beau- 
tiful human women. See "The Sons of God and the Daughters of Men," p. 454, for the 
original myth in this cycle.

173. ADAM THE HERMAPHRODITE 

Some say that Adam was originally created with two faces, one male and one female, one 
facing forward and one behind, as it is said, Male and female He created them (Gen. 1:27). 
Others say that Adam and Eve were created as a single being, with Adam in front and 
Eve in back, so that Adam's back was in the shape of Eve. 

How did this happen? God had originally intended to create two people, but ulti- 
mately only one was brought into being. 

But facing in two directions made walking difficult, and conversation awkward. So 
God changed His mind and split Adam into two, making two backs, one for Adam and 
one for Eve, and dividing them into two separate beings. 

Then there are those who say that Adam lost his second face in a different way, through 
his sin. For when Adam sinned, God took away one of his faces. 

The myth of Adam the Hermaphrodite grows out of three biblical verses: Male and 
female He created them (Gen. 1:27), He blessed them and called them Man (Adam) (Gen. 

5:2), and. You have shaped me from the back and the front (Ps. 139:5). But instead of de- 
scribing Adam and Eve as two people joined into one, Shoher Tov 139:5 suggests that 
" Adam's back was in the shape of Eve." The rabbis also concluded that the man's face 
went first, because of the teaching that a man should not walk behind a woman on the 
road. One rabbi. Rabbi Jeremiah ben Eleazar, identifies Adam as a hermaphrodite, 
thus a being with two sexes. Another rabbi, Rabbi Samuel bar Nachman, identifies 
Adam as a double-faced being who was later split by God into two. Some versions 
say that God "sawed" Adam in two, a rather grisly image. The bumps of the spine are 
said to be evidence of the separation that took place. 

Other readings of this myth also indicate that man and woman emerged from a 
single being. This is true, for example, in the sense that Eve was created from Adam's 
rib. Before Eve was created, then, her potential existed within Adam. Thus Adam and 
Eve were once a single being, not in the sense of separate beings fused together, but in 
the sense of having both male and female qualities. 

This myth acknowledges that God made a mistake, an idea that borders on heresy, 
since God is understood to intrinsically be perfect, and therefore incapable of a mis- 
take. But the actual portrayal of God in the rabbinic texts presents God in a wide 
range of roles, ordering the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and then regret- 
ting it bitterly, or allowing Himself to be overruled by His children. Such a God is 
almost human, with a complex persona that includes the capacity of being contradic- 
tory or of making errors. See the Introduction, p. xlvi. What other errors has God made? 

Some regard the Shattering of the Vessels in the myth of the Ari to be another example 
of a divine error, since the vessels shattered before they reached their original destina- 
tion. See "The Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks," p. 122. 

This myth is a very clear parallel to a Greek myth found in pre-Socratic sources, 
and most famously in Plato's Symposium 189a-190a, that every person seeks to find 
his or her other half. That myth is intended to explain the nature of Eros as a craving for 
completeness, since each person is only a part of what he or she once was. This mean- 



THE CREATION OF MAN 139 


ing does not really carry over in the Jewish version of this myth, except by implica- 
tion. The closest concept in Judaism is that of bashert, in which every person is said to 
have a destined one. This grows out of the talmudic dictum that "Forty days before a 
child is formed, a voice goes forth from heaven to declare that this one will marry that 
one" (B. Sota 2a). 

The Christian biblical commentator Ephraem interpreted male and female He created 
them to mean that Eve was fully formed inside Adam, in the rib that was later taken 
out of him. There is also an Iranian myth about the first human pair, Masye and 
Masyane, who were joined to each other. Here, however, they were so like each other 
that it was not clear which was male and which female. 

In Likutei Moharan, Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav reads this myth allegorically, where 
Adam symbolizes God and Eve symbolizes humanity. Because we have sinned, we 
have turned our backs to God, and therefore God has turned His back on us. But we 
find that we are still attached to God no matter what we do. Only when we repent our 
sin does the "operation" of teshuvah, repentance, take place, and then we stand face to 
face with God again.

174. SAMAEL AND LILITH 

Samael and Lilith were born as one, in the image of Adam and Eve, who were also cre- 
ated as one. Thus Lilith is the mate of Samael. Both of them were bom at the same hour, 
intertwined in each other. 

But Ashmedai, the king of demons, has as his mate Lilith the Younger. This Lilith has 
the form of a beautiful woman from her head to her waist, but from the waist down she 
is burning fire. Samael grew exceedingly jealous of Ashmedai because of Lilith the Younger, 
and this pleased the younger Lilith immensely, as she seeks, above all, to incite wars, 
especially the war between herself and her mother. 

From Ashmedai and Lilith a great prince was bom in heaven, who rules over eighty 
thousand destructive demons. His name is Alefpeneash, and his face bums with rage. If 
he had been created whole, the world would have been destroyed in an instant. 

Samael (one of the names of Satan) and Lilith represent the negative male and 
female sides of the Sitra Ahra, the Other Side. They are the evil mirror image of God 
and the Shekhinah. So intertwined are they with each other, that they are compared to 
the way Adam and Eve were created male and female at the same time, back to back. 

See "Adam the Hermaphrodite," p. 138. Here they are said to have given birth to a 
demon prince named Alefpeneash, the very embodiment of evil.

140 MYTHS OF CREATION 


175. GOD AND THE SPIRITS OF THE UNBORN 

God sits in a circle with many baby spirits that are about to be bom. God knows that the 
babies won't experience the same joy on earth that they experienced in heaven, and He 
doesn t want them to be dissatisfied. So God touches His finger just below their noses, 
leaving an indentation on their upper lips. This makes them forget the joys of heaven, so 
that they can adapt to the world into which they are bom. 

This is an interesting variation of the myth about the origin of the indentation on 
the upper lip. The best known version describes an angel, Lailah, who accompanies 
the child during pregnancy, teaching it all the secrets of heaven. Then the angel touches 
the child on the upper lip just as it is bom. See "The Angel of Conception," p. 199. 

In this oral variant, recounted by Maury Schwartz of Chicago, it is God who touches 
the child's upper lip and leaves the indentation. This is to make the babies forget all 
the joy they experienced with God in heaven, for life on earth will be much more 
difficult. Indeed, this is a somewhat bitter myth, distinctly implying that life on earth 
is one of struggle.

176. ADAM AND THE SPIRITS 

When Adam's body had been completed, a thousand spirits gathered around his lifeless 
form, each one trying to gain entry to it, but without success. Adam's body lay there, 
without a spirit, with a green pallor, with all these spirits hovering around him. Finally a 
cloud descended and drove all the spirits away. Then God breathed the breath of life into 
Adam, and brought him to life. 

According to this myth from the Zohar, a thousand spirits sought to enter Adam's 
lifeless body after God finished creating it, but before God breathed the breath of life 
into him. Each of these spirits, it seems, wanted to be the one to serve as Adam's soul. 

But God himself provided Adam's soul by breathing the breath of life into him. 

The swarming of spirits around Adam resembles the myth about swarms of de- 
mons attempting to seduce Adam during the 130-year period in which he was sepa- 
rated from Eve. See "Adam and the Demons," p. 215.

Zohar 3:19a. 


177. THE FIRST EVE 

God wanted to create a helpmate for Adam. So God created the first Eve right in front of 
him. As Adam watched, the first Eve was created from the inside out — first her bones, 
then her flesh, and finally she was covered with skin. But when God offered her to Adam, 
he fled in disgust and hid in the Garden. 

So the first Eve was taken away, never to be heard from again. Nothing is known of 
her fate. Then God put Adam to sleep, and when he awoke there was another woman, 
and this time he found her to be beautiful. 



ADAM AND EVE 141 


Others say that God took a bone from Adam's bones and flesh from his heart, and 
fashioned the second Eve, and brought her to Adam adorned as a bride. Upon rising 
from deep sleep, Adam saw her standing before him, and embraced and kissed her, say- 
ing, " This one at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh" (Gen. 2:23). That day God 
erected thirteen canopies for Adam in the Garden of Eden, and a great wedding was 
held, attended by myriads of ministering angels, and Eve became his bride. 

There are a number of related myths about a woman who was created before Eve. 

The best- known figure is Lilith, but there is also a tradition about a woman known as 
the first Eve. She was created from the inside out, and Adam ran away from her. The 
fate of the first Eve is essentially unknown. The second Eve is the Eve who was cre- 
ated out of Adam's rib. What is not clear is whether this second Eve was an entirely 
new woman, or if God re-created the first Eve in the form of the second. Also, the re- 
creation theory seems contrary to that of creation out of Adam's rib. Instead, God put 
Adam to sleep, and only showed him the final product, of which Adam approved. 
Adam's acceptance of Eve is reported in the verse " This one shall be called Woman " 

(Gen. 2:23). For a more detailed version of Adam's union with Eve, see "The First 
Wedding," p. 143. 

One cannot help but be struck by the emphatic rejection of the first Eve, whom Adam 
sees created in front of his eyes, from the inside out. In reporting Adam's disgust, the 
text emphasizes her "discharge and blood" ( Genesis Rabbah 18:4). This deep-seated re- 
pugnance reveals an essentially negative view of women that clearly existed among 
some of the rabbis. Lilith is the figure who becomes the primary focus of the negative 
views the rabbis held about women, but it is clear that the first Eve also was created out 
of these negative projections. As for her fate, the myth seems to indicate that the first 
Eve was uncreated and consigned to oblivion. In this she resembles the inhabitants of 
the prior worlds that God created and destroyed. See "Prior Worlds," p. 71. 

Genesis Rabbah 18.2 offers a litany of misogynistic insults in its attempt to explain 
why God chose to create Eve from Adam's rib, A few of these explanations include the 
following: "God said: 'I will not create her from Adam's head, lest she be swelled- 
headed; nor from his eye, lest she be a coquette; nor from his ear, lest she be an eaves- 
dropper, nor from his mouth, lest she be a gossip.'" 

One variant of this myth, in Genesis Rabbah 22:7, states that Cain and Abel fought 
over the first Eve. But the rabbi who proposed this was quickly contradicted by an- 
other, who insisted that the first Eve had already returned to dust.

178. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FIRST EVE? 

Adam's first wife was a clever woman who was stronger than he was. Therefore Adam 
said to God, "Please God. I don't want this woman. Take her and give me another one 
instead." God listened to Adam's request and was about to cast the first Eve into the sea, 
when she said, "Before you take me, I ask you to give me one request." God said, "What 
is it?" The first Eve said, "When a baby boy is bom, let me come to him on the fifth day 
after his birth and reveal the future that is awaiting him." 



142 MYTHS OF CREATION 


God agreed to this request, and every time that a son is born, the first Eve comes to 
him on the fifth day after he is bom, and whispers the future in his ear. 

One hundred years later God remembered Adam's request for a new woman. So God 
put him to sleep, took his left rib, and created a new woman from it. This woman was 
modest and quiet. He called her Eve. 

This is an interesting oral variant of the myth of the first Eve. See the preceding 
myth. On one level it's a rather primitive tale in which Adam rejects Eve because she 
is superior to him, and God agrees to get rid of her. But the myth also establishes a 
custom whereby the first Eve is said to reveal a boy's future on the fifth day after his 
birth, three days before the b'rit. Of course, the infant is not likely to remember this 
prophecy. This is not a widely known tradition, though perhaps it has more resonance 
among Indian Jews, where the story originated. Just as the amulet against Lilith will 
protect a newborn boy for eight days— until the b'rit — so this fifth day role for the first 
Eve creates a birth custom for her, perpetuating the need for her existence, and pre- 
serving her from the oblivion of being uncreated. 

There are also indications that this myth is a variant of the Lilith myth. Like Lilith, 
the first Eve is described here as cleverer than he is. Also, the punishment that God 
plans for her— casting her into the sea— is the same punishment that the angels threaten 
Lilith with unless she returns to her spouse. Finally, God's agreement that the first 
Eve may reveal a boy's future to him on the fifth day after birth echoes Lilith's vow 
that the amulet against her will protect newborn baby boys until the eighth day, when 
they will be protected by the circumcision. See "Adam and Lilith," p. 216 and "A Spell 
to Banish Lilith," p. 218.

179. THE CREATION OF WOMAN 

The Lord God said, "It is not good for man to be alone; I will make a fitting helper for 
him." So the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon the man; and while he slept. He took one 
of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that spot. And the Lord God fashioned the rib that 
He had taken from the man into a woman; and He brought her to the man. Then the man 
said, "This one at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. This one shall be called 
Woman, for from man was she taken." Hence a man leaves his father and mother and 
clings to his wife, so that they become one flesh. 

This is the famous account from Genesis of how God created Eve out of Adam's rib. 

It is one of the few creation stories in world mythology in which the first woman was 
created from the first man, instead of the other way around. Since humans are bom 
from women, the myth stands out as an obvious example of a male myth. Nevertheless, 
the fact that Eve was said to have been created from Adam's rib is a clear indication that 
she was bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh (Gen. 2:23)— thus that they were created 
from one flesh, a view that makes bonding between the man and woman much easier. 

In subsequent translations of the Bible and in the rabbinic texts, the story of Eve's 
creation from Adam's rib was elaborated. In one text, for example, the rib was identi- 
fied as the 13th rib on the right side. The rib, of course, is integral to the biblical ac- 
count, but the midrashic process proposed that Eve might have been created from 
something else. Some say that Eve was created from a face — one of the two faces with 
which Adam was created, before God divided Adam and Eve into separate beings. 

(See "Adam the Hermaphrodite," p. 138.) Still others say that Eve was created from a 
tail, and that Satan was created along with her. The suggestion that Eve was created 



ADAM AND EVE 143 


from a tail, a superfluous part, serves as a vehicle for anti-feminine bias, as does the 
assertion that Satan was created at the same time. In fact, this is a clear attempt to link 
Eve with Satan as a way of condemning all women. Another example of how Eve, and 
thus all women, were blamed for the sin of eating the forbidden fruit and the conse- 
quent punishment of death that followed is found in The Wisdom of Ben Sira : "From a 
woman was sin's beginning, and because of her we all die" (Sir. 25:23). A similar con- 
clusion, stating that God took Adam's rib and created a wife from it so that death 
might come to him from his wife, is found in 2 Enoch (J) 30:17. The negative conse- 
quences of Eve's actions are stated directly in Vita Adae et Evae 44:2, where Adam tells 
Eve "You have brought upon us a great wound, transgression and sin in all our gen- 
erations." See also Targum Pseudo-Yonathan on Genesis 2:7, B. Berakhot 61a, B. Eruvin 
18a, and Genesis Rabbah 8:1, 17:6. 

One strange explanation is that found in The Book of Jubilees 3:8: "In the first week 
Adam was created and also the rib, his wife. And in the second week God showed her 
to him," implying that in the second week God reshaped the rib into a woman, and 
then showed her to Adam. Here the rib, tzela in Hebrew, seems to be described not as 
an integral part of Adam, but as something separate from him. 

One interesting rabbinic interpretation suggests that Adam first made love to Eve 
in a dream. Working with the verse while he slept, He took one of his ribs (Gen. 2:21), one 
rabbi asked, "Why do dreams fatigue men so?" Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish answered, 
"Because woman's creation was in a dream, Adam enjoyed her intimacy in a dream. 
Otherwise he would never have known how to make love" (Midrash Avkir),

180. THE FIRST WEDDING 

God had already created the earth, the sun, the moon, and the stars. All of the animals 
were in the Garden of Eden. The time had come for Adam, the first man, to be created. 

God called upon the angel Gabriel to bring clay from each of the four comers of the 
earth, the north, the south, the east, and the west. This the angel did, and then God formed 
a clay man and breathed the breath of life into him and the man opened his eyes and 
began to breathe. 

Adam gave names to all the animals and explored the Garden of Eden. But God saw 
that Adam was lonely, and He decided to create a mate for him. 

So one day, when Adam was strolling about in the Garden of Eden, God put Adam to 
sleep, and while he was deeply dreaming, God took out one of his ribs, and with that rib 
God created Eve, the first woman. 

When Adam awoke and saw Eve standing in front of him, their faces illuminating 
each other, he understood at once that he had found his true mate. God introduced Adam 
to Eve and explained how she had been created. Then Adam embraced her and kissed 
her and said, " This one at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. This one shall be called 
Woman, for from man was she taken " (Gen. 2:23). 

Then God knew that the time had come for the world's first wedding. God Himself 
prepared tables of precious pearls and filled them with delicacies. 

God also created ten wedding canopies for them, all made of precious gems, pearls, 
and gold. So too did He attire Eve, the first bride, in a beautiful wedding dress, and braid 
her hair and adorn her with twenty-four different ornaments. 



144 MYTHS OF CREATION 


As the ceremony began, the ministering angels walked before Adam, leading him be- 
neath the wedding canopies. Michael and Gabriel were Adam's groomsmen. Then God 
Himself brought the bride to Adam and stood before them like a cantor, and took the cup 
of blessing and blessed them, as it is said, God blessed them (Gen. 1:28). 

As soon as Adam and Eve were wed, still other angels descended to the Garden of 
Eden, playing music for the newlyweds, beating tambourines and dancing to pipes. So 
too did the sun, the moon and the stars dance for them, and all of creation joined in the 
celebration of the world's first wedding. 


Sefer ha-Zikhronot explains that while each bridegroom generally has only one huppah 
(a wedding canopy), and a king has three, God made ten canopies for Adam in order 
to show great honor to the first man. The jewels covering them are all different: chal- 
cedony, topaz, diamond, beryl, onyx, jasper, sapphire, emerald, carbuncle, and gold. 
This list is drawn from Ezekiel 28:18. The twenty-four ornaments that Eve wore are 
listed in Isaiah 3:18-24. 

There is a debate among the rabbis recounted in Genesis Rabbah as to how many 
canopies God created for Adam. While the number generally given is ten, some rabbis 
argued there were 11 or 13. 

One of the wedding blessings for every Jewish couple is that they attain the holi- 
ness and joy granted to Adam and Eve on the day of their wedding. 

This myth also provides the origin of the best man at weddings, for since God 
acted as the best man for Adam, henceforth one must have a best man.

181. ADNE SADEH 

Adam was not the first man that God attempted to create. Little record remains of these 
early attempts that were created and then destroyed, or permitted to become extinct. But 
it is known that before God created Adam, He created a creature called Adne Sadeh. This 
creature had a form that closely resembled that of man, but Adne Sadeh was attached to 
the earth by means of a navel cord, upon which its life depended. This cord, it is true, 
sometimes grew to great lengths of more than a mile, but in any case the creature was 
confined to this radius, for if the cord snapped its life would end. Thus the creature sus- 
tained itself with those fruits and vegetables that grew within the circle, and by occasion- 
ally capturing animals who approached it too closely. 

The life span of Adne Sadeh was very long, and there was little that could take its life, 
short of a flood or other disaster, unless its cord was snapped. Thus this species contin- 
ued to exist until the last members were drowned in the Flood. 

There are some fantastic creatures recounted in Jewish lore. Adne Sadeh is a kind 
of primitive man who was said to be tied to the earth by his navel cord. Midrash Tanhuma 
tells of a traveler who was served this creature, who was regarded as a vegetable 
rather than a man. Afraid that he had fallen among cannibals, he ran away as quickly 
as he could. Ma'aseh Buch tells of a traveling rabbi who was served what appeared to 
be human hands, but that turned out to be a vegetable that looked like a human hand. 

This too may be linked to the myth of the "vegetable man." Louis Ginzberg describes 
Adne Sadeh as a "man of the mountains," and suggests that he was some kind of ape.

182 . THE SEA MONSTER LEVIATHAN 

God created all creatures male and female, including the great sea monster Leviathan 
and its mate. But had those two enormous creatures mated, they would have destroyed 
the world. What did God do? He castrated the male and killed the female, serving it to 
the righteous in the World to Come, as it is said. He will slay the dragon in the sea (Isa. 27:1). 

Leviathan enters the river, swallowing fish of many kinds, gathering strength. Its eyes 
are a great light in the sea, as it is said. And his eyes are like the glimmer of the dawn (Job 
41:10). Its mouth is as wide and deep as the Dead Sea. And when Leviathan is hungry he 
exhales a fiery breath that makes all the waters of the deep boil, as it is said. He makes the 
depths seethe like a cauldron (Job 41:23). 

Leviathan rules nine rivers and the sea. Some say there is a monster in each of those nine 
rivers, as it is said. You smashed the heads of monsters in the waters (Ps. 74:13). Like the great 
Leviathan, they all draw their breath from the realms above, not from the realms below. 

When Leviathan is hungry, he emits a fiery breath from his mouth that causes all the 
waters of the deep to boil. And if he did not purify his breath by putting his head into the 
Garden of Eden, no creature could stand his foul odor. 

The Jordan River passes through the Kinneret and rolls down to the great sea until it 
rushes into the mouth of Leviathan. Still it is not enough, and when Leviathan is thirsty, 
he swallows so much water that the deep does not regain its strength for seventy years. 

Some say that in the future the angel Gabriel will arrange a chase of Leviathan, to see 
if it can be captured, as it is said. Can you draw out Leviathan by a fishhook? (Job. 40:25). But 
unless God assists him, the angel will never prevail. Others say that at the messianic 
banquet God Himself will prepare the tables and slaughter Leviathan, as well as Behe- 
moth and the Ziz. God will leave His glorious throne and sit with the righteous. They 
will eat and drink and be happy, until God commands them to raise the cup of blessing. 
Then King David will stand up and offer a great blessing to God, blessed be He, saying, 
"I raise the cup of deliverance" (Ps. 116:13). And at that time God will take His crown and 
put it on David's head and on the head of the Messiah. 

The Hebrew tradition about sea-monsters is probably drawn from that found in 
Canaanite literary sources, where Ba'al slays the seven-headed monster Lotan, who is 
the equivalent of Leviathan. A Christian vision of a similar seven-headed monster is 
also found in the Book of Revelation 12:3: And behold a great red dragon , having seven 
heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. 

All of these myths are variants on the theme of a primordial battle with the great 
dragon. References to ancient myths about this primordial battle are found in Psalm 
74:13-14: It was You who drove back the sea with Your might , who smashed the heads of the 
monsters in the waters; it was You who crushed the heads of Leviathan. 

The creation of the sea-monsters derives from Genesis 1:21: And God created the 
great sea-monsters. This is understood to refer to Leviathan and his mate. Leviathan is 
a whale-like creature of enormous size who rules the sea. It is described in Job 40:25- 
32. Leviathan is also identified with the dragon, making this a Jewish dragon myth. 
Although only one such creature is said to exist, this is because God slew the female 
of the species to prevent the male and female from mating. It is said that God will 
make a banquet for the righteous from it in the messianic era, and that the righteous 



146 MYTHS OF CREATION 


will be given tabernacles made of the skin of Leviathan. The notion of Leviathan be- 
ing served at such a banquet grows out of Job 40:30: Will bands of fishermen make a 
banquet of him? See "The Messianic Banquet," p. 508, and "A Tabernacle for the Righ- 
teous," p. 510. Here, it is the female Leviathan, which God slays, that will be served at 
the banquet. In other versions, where no reference to the slain female is made. Levia- 
than himself will be served to the righteous and not his mate. For more on Leviathan, 
see "The Great Sea," p. 103. For myths about other enormous creatures, see "Behe- 
moth," p. 146, and "The Ziz," p. 147. 

A series of sea tales about Leviathan are found in the Talmud in B. Bava Batra 74b- 
75a, which are attributed to Rabbah bar Bar Hannah. These closely resemble the tales 
of Sinbad the sailor in The Arabian Nights. 

The myths about Leviathan are closely related to those about Rahab. See "The Re- 
bellion of Rahab," p. 106. 

One of the reasons given for the custom of eating fish at each Shabbat (Sabbath) 
dinner is that this anticipates the feast of Leviathan, which will take place when the 
Messiah comes, as stated in the Talmud, "In the future God will prepare a feast for the 
righteous from the flesh of Leviathan" (B. Bava Batra 75). "This will be a complete and 
perfect Sabbath" (B. Berakhot 57). 

Parallel myths about sea monsters are found in the Babylonian text Enuma Elish 
(1:132-38), where Hamat, who personifies the sea, gives birth to hideous monsters.

183. BEHEMOTH 

Behemoth is a beast of such gigantic proportions that it is the size of a thousand moun- 
tains. Daily it devours the grass of a thousand hills. It drinks so much water that there is 
a special river flowing out of Paradise to quench its thirst. It roars just once a year, in the 
month of Tammuz, and that roar so frightens all the animals in the world that they are 
kept in its control. 

Like Leviathan, Behemoth was created male and female. And if this pair had mated, 
their offspring would have destroyed the world. What did God do? God made the male 
sterile, and cooled the desire of the female, and saved them for the messianic feast in the 
World to Come. 

Some say that in the messianic age Behemoth and Leviathan will slay each other, and 
their flesh will be served at the messianic banquet. Others say that God Himself will slay 
Behemoth and Leviathan, in order to serve them to the righteous at that glorious feast. 

The enormous land monster Behemoth is described in Job 40: 15-24. It is said that 
its flesh will be served at the End of Days at a great feast given by God. See "The 
Messianic Banquet," p. 508. For accounts of other mythic monsters, see "The Sea Mon- 
ster Leviathan," p. 145, and "The Ziz," p. 147.

184. THE ZIZ 

The Ziz is a giant bird as big as Leviathan. When it stands in the ocean, the water only 
reaches to its ankles, and its head is in the sky. Some say its head reaches as far as the 
Throne of Glory, where it sings songs to God. It is so big that when the Ziz unfolds its 
wings, it blots out the sun. Once the sailors on a passing ship saw the Ziz standing there 
and thought the water must be shallow. Then a voice called out from heaven: "Don't dive 
in here! A carpenter dropped his axe here seven years ago, and it still has not reached the 
bottom." Another time, one of the eggs of the Ziz fell to earth and crushed a forest of 
three hundred trees. The liquid from the broken egg flooded sixty cities. 

The Ziz serves as a messenger of God. Once King Solomon learned that a heavenly 
voice had announced that his daughter, the princess, was destined to marry a poor man 
within a year. To keep this from happening. King Solomon sent his daughter to live in a 
high tower in a desert island. Then it happened that the Ziz carried a poor youth from 
Acco to the balcony of that tower, so that die princess and youth were brought together. 
And he lived secretly in that tower with her, and before the year was out they were wed, 
for not even King Solomon could outfox fate. 

So too did the Ziz pick up a young scholar named Shlomo from the roof of his house 
where he was studying and drop him in the garden of the king of Spain. The king took a 
liking to him, and let him live in a hut in the garden. There he met and fell in love with 
the princess, who studied Torah with him and secretly married him. But then the Ziz 
picked him up out of that garden and brought him back to the roof of his parents' house. 
In this way Shlomo was separated from the princess, but after great trials she found her 
way back to him. 

The flesh of the Ziz will be served to the righteous at the messianic banquet that will 
take place at the end of days. 

The Ziz is one of three mythical gigantic creatures that often appear in Jewish lore. 

The others are Leviathan and Behemoth. The Ziz is mentioned in Psalms 50:11: And 
Ziz-Sadai is with Me. In Jewish folklore the Ziz serves as the incarnation of fate. The 
two folktales noted are two famous examples. See "The Princess in the Tower" in 
Elijah's Violin , pp. 47-52, and "The Flight of the Eagle," pp. 82-88 in the same book. 

The account of the sighting of the Ziz by a passing ship is attributed to Rabbah bar 
Bar Hannah, a talmudic sage who reported on many strange sightings in his sea and 
land journeys. These are found in B. Bava Batra 73a-74a. Because of their outlandish 
nature, the tall tales of Rabbah bar Bar Hannah were often interpreted allegorically. 

The Maharsha, Rabbi Samuel Eliezer Edels, interpreted these fables this way, as did 
Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav. For the Maharsha, the waters that first appear shallow 
but turn out to be very deep represent the Torah, which may appear to be only ankle 
deep, but is actually profound and difficult to fathom. The bird's head that reaches 
the sky represents the hidden aspects of the Torah — the secrets of kabbalah. 

In Likutei Moharan , Rabbi Nachman expands on the Maharsha's interpretation in 
which the deep waters represent the deepest secrets of the Torah. He interprets the 



148 MYTHS OF CREATION 


voice that warned against diving in as a warning to those who are not trained in the 
Torah against seeking out its deepest secrets. This is the esoteric view taken by kabbalah 
and succeeding stages of Jewish mysticism. Rabbi Nachman sees the carpenter as God, 
and the axe dropped into the sea as the Messiah, since the Messiah is called God's 
"axe." He finds that the reference to seven years refers to the 7,000 years that the 
world is supposed to exist. Most interesting is Rabbi Nachman's interpretation that 
the falling of the axe refers to the Messiah's own probing of the deepest secrets of the 
Torah. And when he reaches those secrets, then the messianic era will arrive. When 
that takes place, the Messiah will reveal these secrets to the whole world. Note that 
here Rabbi Nachman has created a new messianic myth. 

It is said that the Ziz, like Leviathan, will be served to the righteous at the messi- 
anic banquet at the End of Days. From this the rabbis concluded that the Ziz must be 
kosher. See "The Messianic Banquet," p. 508.

185. THE RE'EM 

A re em that is one day old is the size of Mount Tabor. Once, when King David was a 
young shepherd, he came upon a sleeping re'em. Thinking it was a mountain, he climbed 
upon it. Before long the re’em awoke and rose up, and David, astride its horns, was lifted 
as high as the heavens. Then God caused a lion to appear, coming toward the re'em. 
When the re’em saw the lion, the king of beasts, it knelt down in fear. David was also 
afraid, so God caused a gazelle to come along, and as the lion sprang after it, David 
descended the horn of the re'em and escaped. That is the meaning of the words of the 
Psalm: Deliver me from a lion's mouth, rescue me from the horns of a re’em (Ps. 22:22). 

The re’em is a homed mythological creature of great size, similar to a unicorn or a 
rhinoceros. This legend about King David explains the enigmatic meaning of Psalm 
22:22 by offering an account of the young shepherd David escaping both from the 
re'em and a lion. Compare the account of the death of Cain said to explain the mean- 
ing of Genesis 4:23. See "The Death of Cain," p. 451. The wandering sage Rabbah bar 
Bar Hannah reported seeing a re'em in one of his journeys.

B. Bava Batra 73a; Midrash Tehillim 22:28. 


186. THE PHOENIX 

When God created the Angel of Death, He gave him domination over all creatures except 
for the Phoenix. This is because the Phoenix was the only creature not to taste of the fruit 
of the Tree of Knowledge. Eve had offered the forbidden fruit to all the animals, and only 
the Phoenix had refused to eat it. Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, established the 
Phoenix as an everlasting witness for Israel and let these birds live forever. 

An angel took Baruch to where the sun goes forth. There he saw a bird flying that was 
as large as a mountain. The angel told him that bird was the guardian of the world, for it 
runs with the sun in its circuit, and spreads out his wings and catches the fiery rays of the 



MYTHOLOGICAL CREATURES 149 


sun. If that bird were not there to intercept them, no creature on earth could survive. Its 
food consists of the manna of heaven and the dew of earth. And the angel told Baruch 
that bird was the Phoenix. And when the bird spread its wings, Baruch read what was 
written there: "The earth has not borne me, nor has heaven, but wings of fire bear me." 

Over a thousand years, each Phoenix becomes smaller and smaller until it is like a 
fledgling, and even its feathers fall off. Then God sends two angels, who restore it to the 
egg from which it first emerged, and soon it hatches again, and the Phoenix grows once 
again, and remains fully grown for the next thousand years. 

For many years the Phoenix has made its home in the City of Luz, which the Angel of 
Death cannot enter, where it reproduces its kind. 

This midrash builds on earlier traditions, found in the Talmud, that the Phoenix 
was the only creature given eternal life because of its refusal to taste of the fruit of the 
Tree of Knowledge. A companion tradition holds that the Phoenix was the only crea- 
ture in the ark not to make demands on Noah. The legend of the Phoenix has been 
taken from Egyptian mythology. Note that this rabbinic addition to the legend pro- 
vides an explanation as to how the Phoenix became immortal. Attraction to origin 
tales is characteristic of the Midrash, as is a willingness on the part of the rabbis to 
create them where necessary. 

The myth of the Phoenix moved beyond its Egyptian origins to enter Greek, Jew- 
ish, and Christian literature. It was originally linked with the idea of the bird of the 
sun. For more on the city of immortals where the Phoenix can now be found, see "The 
City of Luz," p. 476. 

There was a debate between the School of Rabbi Jannai and that of Rabbi Judah 
ben Rabbi Simeon. Rabbi Jannai held that the bird and its nest burned after a thou- 
sand years, and only an egg was left, from which the Phoenix came to life again. Rabbi 
Judah argued that its body decomposed and its wings fell off, leaving only the egg, as 
in the other explanation. These two traditions are parallel to those found in the classi- 
cal myth of the Phoenix.

187. THE LION OF THE FOREST ILAI 

Caesar called in Rabbi Joshua ben Haninah to question him about the ways of the Jews. 
He said to him: "Your God is likened to a lion, as it is written in your Holy Scriptures: The 
lion has roared , who will not fear ? (Amos 3:8). What is so great about this? A hunter can kill 
a lion." Rabbi Joshua replied: "You would not want to see this lion." But Caesar insisted, 
saying: "Indeed, I want to see him. If I do not, the lives of the Jews will be in grave 
danger!" 

Then Rabbi Joshua saw that he had no choice, so he prayed that the lion might come 
from its place in the forest Ilai. And before long his prayer was answered, and the lion 
emerged from the forest and set out for the city of Rome. And when the lion was at a 
distance of four hundred parasangs, it roared once, the ground shook, and all the bridges 
of Rome collapsed. When it was at a distance of three hundred parasangs, it roared a 
second time, the molars and front teeth of the people fell out, and Caesar himself fell 
from his throne to the floor. Then Caesar said to Rabbi Joshua: "Enough! I beg you, pray 
that the lion be returned to its place." This Rabbi Joshua did, and the lion turned around 
and returned to the forest from which it had come. 



150 MYTHS OF CREATION 


This myth suggests the terrifying power and glory of God, who is compared to the 
lion of the forest Ilai. The roar of this mythic lion is so loud that even Caesar fell from 
his throne on hearing it and begged for the lion to be returned to its place. The point is 
that God is far more powerful than any human ruler.

188. THE RAM SACRIFICED AT MOUNT MORIAH 

The ram that Abraham found caught in the thicket at Mount Moriah was one of the ten 
things created on the eve of the first Sabbath, along with the rainbow of Noah, the staff of 
Moses, and other precious things. The ram waited in Paradise for many centuries until 
that fateful day on Mount Moriah. All this time the ram knew why it had been created, 
but it was not afraid. Instead, it looked forward to fulfilling its destiny. 

Then the day came when the angel brought the ram from Paradise to serve as the 
sacrifice in place of Isaac at Mount Moriah. There, its horns caught in the thicket, it waited 
for Abraham to set it free. That is why God said to Abraham, "Although your children 
are destined to be entangled in misfortune, in the end they will be redeemed by the horns 
of a ram." 

Nothing of the ram that was sacrificed there was wasted. The skin of the ram became 
Elijah's mantle, the gut was used in David's harp, one horn was sounded by Moses at 
Mount Sinai, and the other will be blown by Elijah at the End of Days, as it is said. And in 
that day, a great ram's horn shall be sounded (Isa. 27:13). 

For a list of the other things created on the eve of the first Sabbath, see "Ten Things 
Created on the Eve of the First Sabbath," p. 77. The ram does not appear in all such lists, 
which vary considerably. See "The Ram Whose Homs Reached Into Heaven" in Gabriel's 
Palace, pp. 137-138. For a modem midrash about the ram, see "The Tale of the Ram" by 
Tsvi Blanchard in Gates to the New City: A Treasury of Modem Jewish Tales, p. 152.

189. GOD THE POTTER 

God is a potter who, in turning His wheel, constantly fashions new vessels, as it is said, 
He revolves wheels by his devices 0ob. 37:12). Using the instrument of the potter's wheel, 
God endlessly reshapes His works, turning one vessel into another. If a man's works are 
good, the potter's wheel revolves to the right, making the course of events highly favor- 
able. For those who turn to evil ways, however, God imparts a spin to the left, and events 
follow an unfavorable course. Thus, through these rotations of the wheel, everything 
turns out as it should. 

In this allegorical myth God is described as a potter, who creates new vessels at His 
wheel— thus, creates new creations. While these are similar to the old creations, each 
new one is still unique. This metaphor about God being a potter was likely inspired 
by Job 37:12, which can be rendered. He revolves wheels by his devices. For a parallel 
theme, see "Re-creating the World," p. 292. 



THE UNFINISHED CREATION 151 


As a kabbalistic allegory, the spinning of the wheel represents the Shekhinah, since 
creation is continually formed and transformed through Her. When the wheel spins 
to the right, this symbolizes Hesed (Lovingkindness), and when it spins to the left, this 
symbolizes Din (Justice). 

Sources: 

Zohar l:109b-110b. 


190. THE UNFINISHED CREATION 

The universe that God created is always in an unfinished state. It is not like a vessel that 
can be worked and finished. It requires continuous work and unceasing renewal. For the 
world is re-created every day, and a man is reborn every morning. Were these forces to 
pause for a second, the universe would return to chaos. 

This teaching is attributed to Rabbi Simcha Bunam of Parsischa (1765-1827). He 
observes that the unfinished nature of Creation is a necessity, not a flaw, for the world 
requires constant renewal. Without this force of renewal, the world would come to an 
end. The Ba'al Shem Tov also taught that the world is renewed daily.

THE TRANSLATION OF ENOCH 


191. ENOCH WALKED WITH GOD 

When Enoch had lived sixty-five years, he begat Methuselah. After the birth of Methuselah, 
Enoch walked with God three hundred years; and he begat sons and daughters. All the 
days of Enoch came to three hundred and sixty-five years. Enoch walked with God; then 
he was no more, for God took him. 

This brief biblical passage is the basis of the enormous Enoch tradition, or else it is 
the summary of a prebiblical tradition concerning Enoch. Because of the verse Enoch 
walked with God; then he was no more, for God took him (Gen. 5:24), the tradition grew that 
Enoch had not died, but had been transported into heaven in a chariot, where he was 
transformed into the angel Metatron. The primary texts about Enoch are 1 Enoch and 
2 Enoch and the Hekhalot text that is often called 3 Enoch in the Pseudepigrapha. It 
seems significant that Enoch is said to have lived 365 years. This seems to associate 
him with the yearly cycle of the sun, perhaps indicating that the myth of Enoch in- 
cludes some remnants of sun worship that have survived in Judaism. Likewise, Enoch's 
metamorphosis into the fiery angel Metatron seems to affirm this link to the sun. See 
"The Metamorphosis and Enthronement of Enoch," p. 156.

Genesis 5:21-24 


192. ENOCH'S VISION OF GOD 

A vision was shown to Enoch: a mist summoned him, and the stars and lightning beck- 
oned him, and the winds lifted him upward and bore him into heaven. He drew near a 
crystal wall surrounded by tongues of fire, and he entered the fire and drew near a crys- 
tal house, for the walls and groundwork of that house were made of crystals. Fire sur- 
rounded the walls of the house, and its portals blazed with fire. Its ceiling was like the 
path of the stars and lightning, and there were fiery cherubim between them. 

In the vision Enoch entered that house, and it was as hot as fire and as cold as ice. 
Quaking and trembling, Enoch fell on his face and had another vision. Here he saw a 
second house, greater than the first, built entirely of flames. Its splendor and magnifi- 
cence cannot be described. Its floor and ceiling were made of fire, and the fiery portal 
stood open before him. And Enoch saw a lofty throne within, and its appearance was as 
crystal, and from beneath the throne came streams of flaming fire, and the wheels of the 
throne shone as brightly as the sun. And there, seated on the throne, was the great glory 
of God, His garment whiter than any snow, its light brighter than the sun, the moon, and 
the stars. A flaming fire was around Him, and a great fire stood before Him, and none 
could draw near him. 

This is an early Merkavah vision, in which God's throne is described as having 
wheels, like a chariot, which is the primary characteristic of the Chariot-Throne litera- 
ture of the Merkavah.

156 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


193. THE METAMORPHOSIS AND 
ENTHRONEMENT OF ENOCH 

It is said that Enoch walked with God, and he was no more, for God took him (Gen. 5:24). 
Enoch, like Noah, was a righteous man in his generation. He was the first among men 
who wrote down the signs of heaven. God saw the righteous ways of Enoch and called 
upon the angel Anafiel to bring Enoch into heaven. An instant later Enoch found himself 
in a fiery chariot, drawn by fiery horses, ascending on high. 

As soon as the chariot reached heaven, the angels caught the scent of a living human 
and were ready to cast him out, for none among the living were permitted there. But God 
called out to the angels, saying, "I have taken an elect one from among the inhabitants of 
earth and I have brought him here to rule in My name." 

Then God lifted Enoch on wings of winds and brought him to the palaces of heaven. 
There God opened the ten Gates of Understanding for him. To this God added wisdom, 
understanding, and knowledge until Enoch was wiser than all the children of heaven. 

Then God put His hand upon Enoch and blessed him, and the metamorphosis of Enoch 
began. His flesh was immediately changed to flames, his sinews to burning flames, his 
bones to fiery coals, the skin of his eyelids to the radiance of lightning, his eyes to torches, 
his hair to fire and flame, and his body to a smoldering flame, with pillars of fire to his 
right and a burning torch to his left, and all around him there raged wind, storm, and 
whirlwind, with the sound of thunder in front and behind him. Seventy- two wings be- 
gan to grow on him, thirty-six on each side, with a wingspan as wide as the world. So too 
did God give him three hundred and sixty-five eyes, each one a sun in itself. No lumi- 
nary in the universe shone brighter than Enoch. 

So too did God give Enoch a new name, Metatron, and make a throne for him similar 
to God s Throne of Glory. And God made a majestic robe for Metatron in which all kinds 
of luminaries were set, and He clothed him in it. And God spread a curtain of splendor 
over him, similar to the curtain of the Throne of Glory. And God placed Metatron , s throne 
at the door of the Seventh Hall, and seated him there. 

Then a herald went forth throughout heaven, saying, "This is My servant, Metatron. I 
have made him into prince and ruler over all the princes of My kingdoms, and over all 
the Children of Heaven, in the name of their king. And every command that Metatron 
utters to you in My name you must observe and fulfill. Moreover, I have set him over all 
the treasuries of the palaces of heaven." 

After this God revealed all the mysteries of the Torah to Metatron, including the se- 
crets of Creation. There was nothing above or below that was hidden from him. After 
that, God made a garment of glory and clad Metatron in it. And He made him a royal 
crown whose splendor filled the seven heavens as well as reaching to the four comers of 
the world. And God wrote letters upon that crown with His finger, the letters by which 
heaven and earth were created and all the orders of Creation. And flames came forth 
from those letters like lightning. And before all the inhabitants of heaven God introduced 
Metatron as the Lesser YHVH, as it is said. For my Name is in him (Exod. 23:21). 

Then, while all the Princes of the heavenly kingdom trembled, God put the crown on 
Metatron's head. Even Samael, Prince of the Accusers, trembled before him, as did the 
Angels of Fire and Hail, the Angels of the Wind, of lightning, and of thunder, the Angels 
of Snow and Rain, the Angel of Day and the Angel of Night, and the Angel of the Sun and 
the Angel of the Moon— all trembled and were filled with fright when they beheld 
Metatron, Prince of the Presence. 

After that Metatron sat on his great Throne at the door of the Seventh Hall, and pre- 
sided over the Celestial Court, with the princes of kingdoms standing to his right and 



THE TRANSLATION OF ENOCH 157 


left. There he served as the Heavenly Scribe, writing down everything and judging the 
Children of Heaven by the authority of God. 

This is the famous myth of Enoch as elaborated in 3 Enoch . Speculation about Enoch, 
building on the biblical assertion that Enoch walked with God and he was no more, for God 
took him (Gen. 5:24), is reflected in three major texts: The Book of Enoch (also known as 
1 Enoch); The Slavonic Book of Enoch (also known as 2 Enoch); and Sefer Hekhalot, the text 
that Hugo Odeberg designated as 3 Enoch or The Hebrew Book of Enoch. The last is 
actually one of the best preserved Hekhalot texts, which describe heavenly journeys, 
dating from around the eighth century. While Enoch ascends into heaven in all three 
of these texts, it is in 3 Enoch that he is transformed into the angel Metatron. While 
earlier texts, such as Targum Yonathan ben Uziel on Genesis 5:24, recount that Enoch 
became Metatron, this transformation is greatly elaborated in 3 Enoch. 

Metatron 7 s role takes on the epic proportions suggested by the description God 
gives of him as the 77 Lesser YHVH," thus a virtual second power in heaven. Here, too, 

God turns so many responsibilities over to Metatron that he comes to serve as a heav- 
enly ruler, whose power derives from God. His job is to record all that takes place 
above and below. 

Some versions, such as that in Midrash Aggadah , explain Enoch walked with God to 
mean that he walked with the angels in the Garden of Eden for 300 years and from 
them he learned the calculation of astronomical cycles, knowledge of the constella- 
tions, and many fields of wisdom. 

A divergence of views about the verse Enoch walked with God can be seen in transla- 
tions of the Bible from Hebrew to Aramaic, known as Targums. These translations 
were read in the synagogue after the Hebrew text, so the people could understand the 
text's meaning, since they spoke Aramaic. These Targums often add midrashic-like 
explanations to the biblical text. Targum Onkelos on Genesis 5:24 denies Enoch's im- 
mortality by asserting that Enoch did, in fact, perish: "And Enoch walked in rever- 
ence of the Lord, then he was no more, for the Lord had caused him to die." Targum 
Pseudo-Yonathan on Genesis 5:24 asserts that Enoch died and then ascended into heaven 
to become Metatron: "Enoch served God faithfully and behold he was not with the 
inhabitants of earth, for he had died and ascended to heaven. And God called his 
name Metatron the great scribe." Targum Neophyti on Genesis 5:24 seems to take a 
middle ground about whether Enoch died or ascended on high: "And Enoch served 
in truth before the Lord and it is not known where he is, because he was withdrawn 
by a command from the Lord." This is in contrast to Targum Yerushalmi to Genesis 
5:24, which contains the seeds of the Enoch/Metatron myth: "He ascended to heaven 
on God's command and was given the name Metatron the Great Scribe." The Septuagint, 
the pre-Christian Greek translation of the Bible, states that God found Enoch righ- 
teous and therefore transferred him to heaven. 

It is worth noting that both Philo and Josephus also commented on this seminal 
verse about Enoch. Philo explains that Enoch was transferred from this world to heaven, 
journeying from this mortal life to an immortal one ( De Mutatione Nominun 38). 
Josephus wrote that Enoch and Elijah became invisible, and no one knows how they 
died. He also writes that after 365 years, Enoch returned to God, and that is why 
nothing is recorded about his death (Jewish Antiquities 1:85, 9:28). 

In addition to the three major Enoch texts, references to Enoch are found in a wide 
variety of ancient Jewish texts, including The Book of Jubilees, The Testament of the Twelve 
Patriarchs , The Sibylline Oracles , 2 Baruch , Life of Adam and Eve , and The Testament of 
Abraham , as well as in rabbinic sources such as the Talmud and Genesis Kabbah. Raziel 
ha-Malakh 2 claims that Enoch learned all the secrets of heaven by reading the same 
book that the angel Raziel delivered to Adam. 

This myth about Enoch's transformation into Metatron is also an enthronement myth. 

In it Enoch/Metatron is crowned by God and receives homage from the other angels, 
and he is seated on a great throne at the door of the seventh palace in the highest heaven. 

Other enthronement myths are found about Adam, Jacob, Moses, and King David. This

indicates that there were once groups within Judaism who at various times viewed 

Adam, Enoch, Jacob, Moses and David as divine figures who ruled with God in heaven. 

Of these, the most extensive tradition is that concerning Enoch. See "The Enthronement 

of Adam," p. 131, "Jacob the Divine," p. 366, "The Enthronement of Moses," p. 388, and 

"King David is Crowned in Heaven," p. 395.

194. THE RIVER OF FIRE 

The angels who serve God one day do not serve him the next. Every single day new 
ministering angels are created from the River of Fire, known as Rigyon. This is the river 
of which it is written, A river of fire streamed forth before Him (Dan. 7:10). This river springs 
out of the perspiration of the heavenly creatures who support God's Throne of Glory and 
emerges from under the throne. There are a great many bridges of fire that have been 
placed over the river of fire, for the souls of the righteous to cross. 

Before they can sing before God, all the angels must first go down and bathe them- 
selves in the river of fire, and dip their tongues and mouths in the river seven times. Then 
they encircle the Throne of Glory, singing hymns of praise to God unceasingly from sun- 
rise to sunset, as it is said. From east to west the name ofYahweh is praised (Ps. 113:3). 

But those angels who serve Him today, do not serve Him tomorrow. And those who 
serve Him tomorrow will never serve Him again. For after they have finished singing for 
the first and last time, their strength is exhausted and their faces are blackened and their 
eyes are darkened, because of the brilliance of the splendor of the King. Metatron, the chief 
angel, says to the newly created angels, "The Throne of Glory is glis tening!" Immediately, 
the angels fall silent and hasten into the river of fire. There the angels meet their end in the 
same fiery stream from which they were created, and others are created to take their place. 

Other angels are consumed by fire that goes forth from God's little finger, as it is said. 
Fire is His vanguard, burning His foes on every side (Ps. 97:3). 

Why are the angels destroyed? Some say it is because they did not sing the hymns of 
the celestial liturgy in perfect unison, or do not utter their prayers in the proper order. 
Others say it is so that the angels will not hear the sound of the speech of God and the 
explicit Name of God that Metatron utters at that time. 

But the River of Fire can restore as well as destroy. This river serves as the heavenly 
mikveh, the ritual bath in which all souls are immersed. In this way all impurities are 
burned up, while all that is pure passes through unscathed. 



THE TREASURY OF SOULS 159 


The existence of a heavenly river of fire derives from Daniel 7:10: A fiery stream 
came forth before him. The traditions concerning this fiery river, known as nehar di-nur, 
the river of fire, also grow out of the talmudic interpretation of the biblical verse They 
are renewed every morning — ample is Your grace (Lam. 3:23). It is also known as the River 
Rigyon. In B. Hagigah 14a, Rabbi Samuel says to Rabbi Hiyya ben Rav, “Every single 
day new ministering angels are created from the River of Fire. They sing hymns of 
praise to God and are then destroyed." This river is also referred to in some Hekhalot 
texts, and the myth is elaborated in later midrashic texts. The source of the fiery river 
is the perspiration of the hayyot, the heavenly creatures who hold up God's throne. 
See "The Living Creatures," p. 159. In kabbalistic texts, the river of fire is said to flow 
through the heavenly or supernal Eden, and it is said to have both restorative and 
destructive properties. The souls of the righteous are ritually immersed in this stream, 
removing all impurities. 

Here large numbers of angels, who constitute a celestial choir, are created and de- 
stroyed out of the river of fire. The irony that they are destroyed in the same river out 
of which they were created is noted in Genesis Rabbah and other sources. 

Metatron, who was once Enoch, is the Prince of the Presence, in charge of all the 
other angels. In the Sefer ha-Komah, Metatron's role is to signal when the newly cre- 
ated angels should stop singing and return to the fiery river out of which they were 
created. The statement Metatron makes, that "The Throne of Glory is glistening!" is 
apparently some kind of a code, which the angels understand commands them to end 
their existence. 

The Name of God that Metatron pronounces is the Tetragrammaton, YHVH. Any- 
one who knows its secret pronunciation would have the power of the Name, virtually 
the power of God. That is one reason given for the daily destruction of the angels of 
the heavenly choir, so that they are kept from learning this secret. 

According to Zohar 2:252b, the River of Fire flows during the days of the week, but 
"When Sabbath arrives the river quiets, its storms and sparks cease." Thus it is por- 
trayed as a kind of heavenly river Sambatyon, the river that is said to flow six days a 
week and to rest on the Sabbath. See "The River Sambatyon," p. 475.

195. THE LIVING CREATURES 

The creatures of the upper world and the creatures of the lower world were created at the 
same instant. But the creatures of the upper world, who hold up the Throne of Glory, are 
nourished by the splendor of the Shekhinah, while the creatures of the lower world must 
labor for their nourishment. There are four heavenly creatures, facing the four winds. Each 
one is as large as the whole world. Each one has four faces and four wings, and every wing 
would cover the world. Clothed in fire and wrapped in a garment of flame, these heavenly 
beasts stand laden, day and night, in trembling and terror, for the Divine Chariot is above 
them, and the Throne of Glory upon their heads, and rivers of fire pass between them. 

God says to them, "Exalt yourselves. It is proper that those who bear up My throne 
should make yourselves strong. May the hour be blessed in which I created you. May the 
planet be exalted under which I formed you. For you are precious vessels I have pre- 
pared and completed." So the living creatures strengthen and hallow and purify them- 
selves. Each one binds thousands of crowns on its head. And they stand in holiness and 
sing songs and hymns with one voice, one mind, and one melody. 



160 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


One of the living creatures leads the heavenly hosts in the morning prayers. This crea- 
ture stands in the center of the firmament and says, "Bless you the blessed God!" On its 
forehead is engraved its name, Israel, and the words, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our 
God, the Lord alone." Other heavenly creatures, all consisting of fire, ascend to the Throne 
of Glory and stand beneath the legs of the Throne of Glory, each with four faces and four 
wings. The King, the living and eternal God, dwells above them. 


Drawing on Ezekiel s Vision (Ezek. 1:1-28), rabbinic and kabbalistic sources refer 
to the hayyot, the living creatures (also known as the heavenly creatures), who are said 
to hold up God's Throne of Glory: Above the expanse over their heads was the semblance of 
a throne (Ez. 1:26). A description of these creatures is found in Ezekiel 1:13-14: Such 
then was the appearance of the creatures. With them was something that looked like burning 
coals of fire. This fire, suggestive of torches, kept moving about among the creatures ; the fire 
had a radiance, and lightning issued from the fire. Dashing to and fro among the creatures was 
something that looked like flares. 

Clearly, traditions concerning these heavenly creatures are the purest form of myth. 
The identification of these heavenly creatures with lightning also underscores the 
mythic ties to natural events. These creatures are unique to heaven, but they are not 
like any of the categories of the angels. They are, instead, another kind of fiery crea- 
ture. References to these creatures are often found in the hymns of the Hekhalot texts. 

The name of the living creature (hayah) who leads the heavenly hosts is Israel, and 
the words of the Shema, the central prayer of Judaism, taken from Deuteronomy 6:4, 
are inscribed on its forehead. The portion of the daily liturgy that the celestial beast 
leads is called the Barekhu. See "The Living Creatures," p. 159. 

A parallel is found in Sefer ha-Komah, where the precious jewel in the center of 
God's crown is described as having the words, "Israel, My people; Israel, My people, 
is Mine."

196. THE COUNCIL OF SOULS 

The souls of the righteous existed long before the creation of the world. God consulted 
these souls in creating the universe, as it is said. They dwelt there in the king's service (I 
Chron. 4:23). God called upon the souls of the righteous, who sat on the council with the 
Supreme King of Kings, to come together. He then took counsel with them before He 
brought the world into being, saying, "Let us make man" (Gen. 1:26). So too did they help 
Him with His work. Some assisted in planting and some helped create the borders of the 
sea, as it is said. Who set the sand as a boundary to the sea (]er. 5:22). Nor does God make any 
important decision without consulting the Council of Souls. So too did God take counsel 
with the souls of the righteous. He asked them if they were willing to be created. And 
that is how the souls of the righteous, including the souls of Abraham and the other 
patriarchs, came into being. 

While there are traditions that God took council with the angels or a divine partner 
such as Adam in creating the world, here the phrase, "Let us make man" from Genesis 



THE TREASURY OF SOULS 161 


1:26 is said to refer to a Council of Souls ( nefashot shel Tzaddikim), with whom God 
consulted before creating the world. These souls of the righteous are said to have 
existed before the creation of the world. In fact, it is not specified that they were cre- 
ated by God at all, but only called together by God before He created the universe. 
Further, they not only give their consent for the creation of the world, but they partici- 
pate in it, assisting God in planting and creating the boundaries of the sea. Rabbi Levi 
Yitzhak of Berditchev interprets God's consulting with the souls of the righteous to 
mean that He asked them if they were willing to be created. 

Evidence of a divine council can be found in several biblical passages, such as 
Psalms 82:1, which states that God stands in the divine assembly ; among the divine beings 
He pronounces judgment . Here the term for the divine assembly is "adat el " In Canaanite 
Myth and Hebrew Epic, Frank Moore Cross describes this council as the Israelite coun- 
terpart of the Council of El found in Canaanite mythology, referring to El, the primary 
Canaanite god. It would thus seem that this obscure Jewish tradition is directly drawn 
from the Canaanite. Psalm 82 adds a strange twist to this myth: God appears to con- 
demn the gods of the Council of Gods to death: " I had taken you for divine beings, sons of 
the Most High, all of you; but you shall die as men do, fall like any prince " (Ps. 82:6). This 
might be interpreted to mean that monotheism declares the death of polytheism. 
Jeremiah 23:18 also describes a divine council: But he who has stood in the council of 
Yahweh, and seen, and heard His word — He who has listened to His word must obey. Another 
reference to the divine council is found in 1 Kings 22:19-22, where God addresses the 
host of heaven, asking who will entice Ahab, and a certain spirit came forward and stood 
before the Lord and said, "I will entice him. " Other passages suggesting the existence of 
heavenly beings with whom God discusses His decisions include Isaiah 6 and Job 1-2. 
. Usually the term, "the souls of the righteous," refers to the souls of the pious who 
have died, and whose souls have ascended to Paradise. By pre-existing, these souls 
become identified as primordial gods, such as are found in other Near Eastern my- 
thologies. By calling them together as a council, God implicitly recognizes their power. 
It must be assumed that the council of souls gave its approval for the creation of the 
universe, since God proceeded with it after that. 

Another possible explanation would be to identify "the souls of the righteous" in 
this midrash with the angels. In other sources, God is said to have consulted with the 
angels before creating man, and there are traditions and countertraditions of the no- 
tion that the angels somehow participated in the creation of the world itself. See "Cre- 
ation by Angels," p. 116. However, it would be highly unusual to refer to the angels as 
"the souls of the righteous," although Philo does refer to angels as "unbodied souls." 

A prooftext for the existence of such a council of souls or angels can be found in 
Daniel 4:14: The matter is by decree of the watchers, and the sentence by the word of the holy 
ones. Both of these terms, the "watchers" and the "holy ones," suggest some kind of 
supernatural figures from the heavenly realm, whether angels, souls, or additional di- 
vinities. The Council of Souls may also be identified with the heavenly court, and iden- 
tified as the Watchers. See "The Heavenly Court," p. 208, and "The Watchers," p. 457. 

There are parallel myths about God consulting the angels, rather than souls, in the 
creation of Adam. The text of Genesis 1:26 states that God said: " Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness." But in the Pseudo-Yonathan Targum on Genesis 1:26, this is 
changed to read: "And God said to the angels who minister before him, who were 
created on the second day of Creation. ' Let us make man in our image, after our likeness/" 
See "Creation By Angels," p. 116. 

In Genesis Rabbah 8:9 the question of how many deities created the world is directly 
broached: "How many deities created the world? You and I must inquire of the first 
day, as it is said. For ask now of the first days (Deut. 4:32)." The rabbis subsequently 
debate whether the first sentence of Genesis describes creation by one God or by many, 
since Elohim is plural. Read this way, the first line of Genesis reads: "In the beginning 
Gods created the heaven and the earth." That such a debate can take place at all is 
remarkable, considering the centrality of monotheism. But it is also a tribute to the 



162 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


open-ended willingness of the rabbis to explore even apparently heretical interpreta- 
tions of the Torah. The existence of this discussion and the fact that it was recorded in 
a primary text such as Genesis Rabbah, indicates that the "heretical" had some advo- 
cates among the rabbis. Perhaps it harkens back to a residual pagan myth, a Canaanite 
myth about a council of gods. 

Such divine councils rule in Mesopotamian, Babylonian, and Canaanite mythol- 
ogy. In the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish, Marduk is made head of the divine council 
by defeating Tiamat, the personification of the sea. It is likely that the existence of 
such a council in Jewish tradition is a remnant of such an ancient myth. Ugaritic texts 
describe the abode of El, the primary Canaanite god, and his council on the mountain 
of El, where the gods are seated at a table. El's abode is said to be in the north. This 
setting and location is echoed in Isaiah 14:13: "I will sit in the mount of assembly, on the 
summit ofZaphon." (Zaphon is Hebrew for "north.") 

God's perplexing use of the first person plural in verses such as Let us make man in 
our image (Gen. 1:26), Behold the man has become like one of us (Gen. 3:22), and Let us, then, 
go down and confound their speech there (Gen. 11:7) can be explained as addressing the 
divine council. This same usage is found in the Ugaritic texts. Most midrashic texts 
interpret "Let us" as God addressing the angels.

197. ADAM'S SOUL 

All souls were originally included in Adam's soul. After Adam was created, God showed 
him all the souls contained within his soul, and all the future generations that would 
follow. Thus Adam is the source of all souls. That is why on Rosh ha-Shanah, the day that 
Adam was created, the entire world is judged, for Adam contained within him all the 
souls of mankind. 

After Adam sinned, the souls attached to Adam's soul descended into evil. However, 
some of the other souls that were originally part of Adam's soul split off, for Adam's soul 
originally included six hundred thousand "old souls." But when Adam sinned these 
souls broke into six hundred thousand soul-roots. Ever since, these souls have been rein- 
carnated in this world, so they can rectify Adam's sin. 

However, some say that before Adam was fully created, souls of different people were 
to be found in different parts of his body, and when Adam decided to eat from the Tree of 
Knowledge, elevated souls flew away from him. Then there are others who say that there 
were also new souls in Adam's soul, which had never come into the world. These souls 
were not revealed to Adam, and after he died, these new souls became separated from 
him. They now issue forth from the Tree of Life. Many angels are produced above to 
protect these holy souls from harm. In this way a multitude of these living souls are 
generated, which are drawn down to those worthy of them. 

Since Adam was the first human, Jewish tradition holds that his soul was the source 
of all subsequent souls. The total number of souls is said to be 600,000, the number of 



THE TREASURY OF SOULS 163 


the Israelite men present at Mount Sinai. According to Ben Ish Hai in Derushim Bereshit, 
the soul of each Jew is represented by a letter of the Torah. According to Hayim Vital, 
"The source of all souls is Adam and is then divided into the three patriarchs, then 
into the 12 tribes, and afterwards divided into the 70 souls who accompanied Jacob to 
Egypt. Each of these 70 parts is further divided until we find that the total number of 
souls descended from Adam's soul is 600,000" ( Sefer ha-Hezyonot 4:41). In Sefer ha- 
Gilgulim Hayim Vital offers an alternate explanation: "The majority of all souls come 
from Adam's sons Cain and Abel, and from them separate into all who were bom 
afterward." 

However, once the Jewish population exceeded 600,000, the problem arose about 
the source of their souls. The solution was the concept of "sparks of souls." According 
to this explanation, Jewish souls received not whole souls, but sparks of souls — por- 
tions of souls. Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav describes these as "offshoots of the 600,000 
primary souls" ( Likutei Moharan 119b). In the same passage. Rabbi Nachman speaks of 
"illustrious Tzaddikim who beget souls from a heavenly source higher than the 600,000 
primary sources." He also said that it is possible for one person to have sparks of 
souls of several individuals. Thus Rabbi Nachman spoke of having sparks of the souls 
of Moses, Rabbi Akiba, the Ari, and the Ba'al Shem Tov. For a related myth, see "The 
Creation of Souls," following. 

In Homat Anakh, Lekh Lekha, Rabbi Hayim Yosef David Azulai, quoting the Ari, 
states that the good element of Adam's soul was reincarnated in Abraham, Isaac and 
Jacob, while the evil part of his soul was reincarnated in Ishmael, Lot and Esau. This 
solves the problem of how both good and evil people descended from Adam. An 
alternate explanation is that some particularly pure souls, such as the soul of the Ba'al 
Shem Tov, hid in the garden while Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit. Thus they 
were spared the consequences of the sin. 

Rabbi Elimelekh of Lizhensk is said to have said to his brother. Rabbi Zusya of 
Hanipol (1719-1800): "My brother Zusya, if all souls were contained in Adam's soul, it 
means that our souls were also there. How is it, then, Zusya, that you didn't stop 
Adam from eating from the Tree of Knowledge?"

198. THE CREATION OF SOULS 

All the souls that would ever exist, from Adam till the End of Days, were fashioned 
during the six days of Creation. All remained in the Garden of Eden on high, and all were 
present at the Giving of the Torah. That is meaning of the verse Whatever happens , it was 
designated long ago and it was known that it would happen (Eccles. 6:10). 

All souls in the world above were initially both male and female. But when they are 
bom into this world, they are either male or female, the male soul in a male body and the 
female soul in a female body. If worthy, they will reunite again in marriage, and they join 
together to form a single unit in every way, body and soul. That is why the other's soul is 
known as a soulmate. 

All of these souls were present in the Garden of Eden and at the giving of the Torah. 
But one pure soul among them, that of the Ba'al Shem Tov, was not present when Adam 
and Eve tasted the forbidden fruit. 



164 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


Six hundred thousand souls were present at Mount Sinai. Later, when there were more 
Jewish bodies than souls, only a few Tzaddikim received complete souls. Instead, most 
people have sparks of a soul, or the sparks of more than one soul. 

This myth explains the traditions behind the concept of a person seeking their 
bashert or destined one. Here it is understood that the one who is sought is actually 
the other half of a person's soul, with whom he or she was once united in paradise. 

For more on the concept of bashert see "God Makes Matches," p. 66. 

Hie sixteenth century kabbalists of Safed included reincarnation or gilgul among 
their basic principles, and it remains a key principle among Sephardic Jews, in par- 
ticular, to this day. The Ari believed that he was the reincarnation of Rabbi Akiba. For 
more on the subject of sparks of soul, see "Adam's Soul," p. 162. 

The Torah is said to contain 600,000 letters, one for each one of the 600,000 souls 
present at Mount Sinai. Commenting on this. Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav said, "I can- 
not sleep. Before I fall asleep, all 600,000 letters of the Torah come and stand before 
me" (Sihot ha-Ran 176). According to Rabbi Moshe Hayim Luzzatto, known as Ramhal, 
there are 600,000 heavenly souls, which are the roots of all the souls of Israel. Each 
soul consists of an upper part that remains in heaven and a lower counterpart that 
inhabits a human body ( Adir ba-Marom). 

Rabbi Menashe ben Israel finds the presence of the souls at Mount Sinai attested 
for by the verse, I make this covenant to those who are standing here, and with those who are 
not here with us today (Deut. 29:14). In this context the word "standing" is used in the 
sense of existing. Thus those who are standing here refers not only to the souls of the 
living, but to the unborn souls of future generations as well. They too were present at 
Sinai to receive the Torah. In this way, the souls of all Jewish generations received the 
Torah at Mount Sinai at the same time ( Nishmat Hayim 2:16). See "The Giving of the 
Torah," p. 270. 

Rabbi Dov Ber offers a unique interpretation of the origin of souls. He states that 
each soul is a tiny particle of the Shekhinah, like a drop in the ocean (Maggid Devarav le- 
Ya'akov 66.)

199. TREE OF SOULS 

God has a tree of flowering souls in Paradise. The angel who sits beneath it is the Guard- 
ian of Paradise, and the tree is surrounded by the four winds of the world. From this tree 
blossom forth all souls, as it is said, "I am like a cypress tree in bloom; your fruit issuesforth 
from Me." (Hos.l4:9). And from the roots of this tree sprout the souls of all the righteous 
ones whose names are inscribed there. When the souls grow ripe, they descend into the 
Treasury of Souls, where they are stored until they are called upon to be bom. From this 
we learn that all souls are the fruit of the Holy One, blessed be He. 

This Tree of Souls produces all the souls that have ever existed, or will ever exist. And 
when the last soul descends, the world as we know it will come to an end. 

Rabbinic and kabbalistic texts speculate that the origin of souls is somewhere in 
heaven. This myth provides the heavenly origin of souls, and in itself fuses many tradi- 
tions. First, it develops themes based on the biblical account of the Garden of Eden. It 
also builds on the tradition that just as there is an earthly Garden of Eden, so is there a 



THE TREASURY OF SOULS 165 


heavenly one, as expressed in the principle, "as above, so below." Just as there is a Tree 
of Life in the earthly garden, so there is a Tree of Life in the heavenly one. 

Had Adam and Eve not tasted the fruit of the earthly Tree of Life, they would have 
been immortal. But once they had tasted the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, immortality 
was closed to them. Therefore He drove the man out, and stationed east of the garden of Eden 
the cherubim and the fiery ever-turning sword, to guard the way to the Tree of Life (Gen. 3:24). 

As for the Tree of Life in Paradise, its blossoms are souls. It produces new souls, 
which ripen, and then fall from the tree into the Guf, the Treasury of Souls in Paradise. 
There the soul is stored until the angel Gabriel reaches into the treasury and takes out 
the first soul that comes into his hand. After that, Lailah, the Angel of Conception, 
guards over the embryo until it is bom. Thus the Tree of Life in Paradise is a Tree of 
Souls. See "The Treasury of Souls," p. 166. For an alternate myth about the origin of 
souls, see "The Creation of Souls," p. 163. For the myth of the formation of the embryo 
see "The Angel of Conception," p. 199. 

Rabbi Isaac Luria of Safed, known as the Ari, believed that trees were resting places 
for souls, and performed a tree ritual in the month of Nisan, when trees are budding. 
He felt that this was the right time to participate in the rescue of wandering spirits, 
incarnated in lower life forms. The Ari often took his students out into nature to teach 
them there. On one such occasion, upon raising his eyes, he saw all the trees peopled 
with countless spirits, and he asked them, "Why have you gathered here?" They re- 
plied, "We did not repent during our lifetime. We have heard about you, that you can 
heal and mend us." And the Ari promised to help them. The disciples saw him in 
conversation, but they were not aware of with whom he conversed. Later they asked 
him about it, and he replied, "If you had been able to see them, you would have been 
shocked to see the crowds of spirits in the trees." 

The core text of this myth comes from Ha-Nefesh ha-Hakhamah by Moshe de Leon 
(Spain, 13th century) who is generally recognized as the primary author of the Zohar. 
It is possible that de Leon symbolically identified the Tree of Souls with the kabbalistic 
"tree" of the ten sefirot. Tikkunei Zohar speaks of the ten sefirot blossoming and flying 
forth souls. (See also the diagram of the sefirot on p. 529.) 

Not only is there the notion of a Tree of Souls in Judaism, and the notion that souls 
take shelter in trees, but there is also the belief that trees have souls. This is indicated 
in a story about Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav found in Sihot Moharan 535 in Hayei 
Moharan : Rabbi Nachman was once traveling with his Hasidim by carriage, and as it 
grew dark they came to an inn, where they spent the night. During the night Rabbi 
Nachman began to cry out loudly in his sleep, waking up everyone in the inn, all of 
whom came running to see what had happened. When he awoke, the first thing Rabbi 
Nachman did was to take out a book he had brought with him. Then he closed his 
eyes and opened the book and pointed to a passage. And there it was written "Cutting 
down a tree before its time is the same as killing a soul." Then Rabbi Nachman asked 
the innkeeper if the walls of that inn had been built out of saplings cut down before 
their time. The innkeeper admitted that this was true, but how did the rabbi know? 
And Rabbi Nachman said: "All night I dreamed I was surrounded by the bodies of 
those who had been murdered. I was very frightened. Now I know that it was the 
souls of the trees that cried out to me."

166 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


200. THE TREASURY OF SOULS 

The souls of all those who have not yet been bom are kept in the Gw/, the Treasury of 
Souls, also known as the Chamber of Creation. There each soul waits its turn to be bom. 
When the time comes for it to descend into this world, an angel is issued along with it, 
who accompanies it. It is said that sparrows can see the souls descend, and that is the 
source of their song. As soon as the soul leaves the Gw/, it divests itself of its heavenly 
garment, and is clothed in a garment of flesh and blood. 

Where is the Treasury of Souls? In the highest heaven, known as Aravot, where there 
are many treasuries, each of them guarded by angels, including the Treasury of Rain, the 
Treasury of Ice and Snow, the Treasury of Clouds, the Treasury of Peace, the Treasury of 
Blessing, and the Treasury of the Dew with which God will revive the dead. The Gw/ is 
found near the Throne of Glory, and a dazzling brilliant light emanates from the many 
souls in repose there. Those souls are in their pristine state, untainted by existence in this 
world. Some of them flicker like a small candle and some shine like a torch, and there are 
some whose radiance rivals the sun. 

When the time comes for the soul to leave this world, the Angel of Death strips off the 
worldly garment, and at the same instant the soul is clothed in the holy garment that was 
stripped away when it descended to this world. Then the soul delights in having been 
stripped of its worldly body and in having its original garment restored. And the souls 
who have departed from their earthly bodies return to that same treasury, and fly before 
the Throne of Glory in the presence of God. And when the time comes for a human to be 
bom, the angel Gabriel puts his hand into the Treasury of Souls and takes out the first 
soul that comes into his hand. If the person is fortunate, a great soul comes into Gabriel's 
hand; if not a spark of a soul inhabits the body. 

It is said about the soul of the Ba'al Shem Tov that its radiance shone from one end of 
the universe to the other. Each time the angel Gabriel sought to bring this soul down to 
this world, Satan would storm into heaven and protest. In this way, the brightest of souls 
remained in heaven for thousands of years, but at last it descended and the Ba'al Shem 
Tov was bom. 

There are those who say that the Gw/ contains an infinite number of souls, while others 
insist there is only a finite number of souls in it, and that the Messiah will not come until 
the Gw/ has been emptied of every soul. Others say that from the day the Temple was 
destroyed, no more souls entered the Gw/, and when it has been emptied of all the re- 
maining souls, the Messiah will come. 

And when the last soul has descended and the Gw/ is empty, the first infant to be bom 
without a soul, bom dead as such an infant must be, will herald the death of the world 
and so is called the final sign. Then all of the sparrows will grow silent, and the world, as 
we know it, will end, and the End of Days will begin. 

There is general agreement in rabbinic lore that the souls of the unborn are kept in 
a storehouse or Treasury of Souls. In B. Avodah Zarah 5a, Resh Lakish, an important 
talmudic sage, is quoted as saying, "The Messiah will only come when all the souls 
destined to inhabit earthly bodies have been exhausted." Rashi, commenting on this, 
says that "There is a treasure house called the Gw/, and at the time of Creation all souls 
destined to be bom were formed and placed there." This treasure house is said to 
contain souls created since the six days of Creation, which are being saved for bodies 
yet to be created. It is also described in B. Yevamot 63b as located behind the heavenly 
curtain known as the Pargod, where "there are spirits and souls created since the six 
days of Creation that are intended for bodies yet to be created." 



THE TREASURY OF SOULS 167 


A linkage is also made between the depletion of souls in this treasury and the End 
of Days. The Talmud ( B . Yev. 62a) states, "The Son of David will not come before all 
the souls in the Gw/have been disposed of, as it is said, " For the spirit that unwraps itself 
is from Me and the souls that I have made" (Isa 57:16). Gw/literally means a "body," thus 
the storehouse of souls is literally "a body of souls." This enigmatic verse grew into 
the myth of the Guf, a treasury that provided souls for those still to be bom. The myth 
describes the events that will take place when the treasury runs out of souls. In 3 
Enoch 43 Rabbi Ishmael expands on this verse. He concludes that the first part of the 
verse "For the spirit that unwraps itself is from Me" refers to the souls of the righteous 
that have already been created in the Guf and have returned to the presence of God. 
The second part of the verse, "and the souls that I have made" refers to the souls of the 
righteous that have not yet been created. 

In addition to the myth of the Guf the concept of such a treasury is found in other 
forms in Jewish tradition. An alternate version of the origin of souls is found in Zohar 
Hadash, Bereshit lOb-lOc, in which it is stated that God hewed from His Throne all 
souls that would be born, and stored them in the storehouse of souls. There is also 
said to be another storehouse of the souls of the righteous who have died. As long as 
a person is alive, his soul is entrusted to his Creator, as it is said, O keep my soul and 
deliver me (Ps. 25:20). Once a righteous person dies, his soul is placed in this other 
treasury, as it is said. The soul of my Lord will be bound up in the bundle of life in the care of 
the Lord (1 Sam. 25:29). 

A third explanation of the origin of souls is found in Nishmat Hayim 2:7, where holy 
souls are said to spring forth from God. In contrast, in Torat Moshe, Rabbi Moshe 
Alshekh describes the soul as a spiritual light that emanates from the Shekhinah. Thus 
in one version the soul comes forth from the male aspect of God; in the other, it shines 
forth from God's Bride. 

There are alternate myths about other places where the souls of the unborn are kept. 
Some say that the highest abode of the soul is the pure place under the Throne of Glory, 
where all the souls of the unborn are kept close to their Creator. According to Ben Ish 
Hai in Derushim Bereshit , both the Torah and the souls of Israel come from the Throne of 
Glory, which he identifies with the World of Creation (Beriah), one of the four Kabbalistic 
"worlds." Still other sources, including Sefer ha-Bahir and the Zohar, identify the Shekhinah 
with the soul, calling the Shekhinah the dwelling place of the soul. This teaches that the 
soul had its origin on high, and that the Shekhinah is the soul that dwells in everyone. 
This identification of Shekhinah with soul is also found in the myth of the neshamah yeterah, 
the second soul that arrives on the Sabbath at the same instant as the Shekhinah in the 
form of the Sabbath Queen. See "The Second Soul," p. 310 and "The Pargod, p. 186. 

The Seventh Sign (1988), a popular film in the apocalyptic genre, is based on the 
theme of the Guf Its plot takes place when the first infant without a soul is about to be 
bom, a sign that the world is about to end. This is an accurate account of the prophecy 
about a child born after the last soul departs from the Guf except that the film tries to 
turn a Jewish apocalyptic myth into a Christian one. 

For the related myth of the origin of souls, see "Tree of Souls," p. 164. See also "The 
Creation of Souls," p. 163.

168 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


201. THE PATH OF THE SOUL IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN 

Some say that when the righteous leave this world, three companies of angels join them. 
These angels go ahead of the righteous, leading them to the Garden of Eden. And when 
the soul of a Tzaddik leaves his body, the archangel Michael goes out to meet it, saying, 
"May you come in peace." 

Others say that there is a column through which the soul of a person who has passed 
away travels from the lower Garden of Eden to the higher Garden. By means of this 
column, the soul rises from one world to another, from one year to another, and from soul 
to soul. This is called "the column of service and fear of heaven." 

Still others say that the souls of the righteous ascend the Tree of Life into heaven, to the 
celestial Garden of Eden. That garden is planted on a source of living water, and the size 
of the garden is a thousand years' journey. 

The reward awaiting the righteous when they take leave of this world is the Olam 
ha-Ba , the World to Come. This is also identified in rabbinic texts as Gan Eden , the 
Garden of Eden. This myth describes what occurs when a righteous person dies and 
goes to receive his heavenly reward. The second teaching, that of the "column of ser- 
vice and fear of heaven," is attributed to the Ba'al Shem Tov. It resolves the problem of 
the link between the earthly Gan Eden and the heavenly one. It also explains how it is 
possible for a soul to ascend to higher levels of Paradise. The description of moving 
"from soul to soul" may be a reference to gilgul, the transmigration of souls, i.e., rein- 
carnation. Hasidic theory also includes the possibility of the combining of sparks of 
souls, and moving "from soul to soul" might also be referring to this. 

Studies: 

Midrash Tehillim 30:3; Midrash Konen in Beit ha-Midrash 2:24-39; Zohar Hadash 24d-25a, 
Midrash ha-Ne'elam; Rabbi Yisrael Ba'al Shem Tov, p. 47. 


202. THE FIELD OF SOULS 

There is a field where wondrous trees grow. Its splendor cannot be described. The trees 
and grass are holy souls that grow there. There are also many naked souls that stray 
beyond its borders and await repair. For even the greatest soul has difficulty reentering 
that field once it has departed. And all of those exiled souls call for the field master who 
will engage himself in tikkun, so that those souls can be repaired. 

Whoever takes on that task must be steadfast and courageous. There is one such man 
who can only complete this task through his own death. He must endure many afflic- 
tions, but in the end he will accomplish the work of the field and prevail. 

This is an allegory of Rabbi Nachman's about the meaning of exile from the Gar- 
den of Eden, and about the tikkun, or repair, of souls. The field of souls is the Garden 
of Eden, or Paradise (which blur together in the rabbinic concept of Gan Eden), where 
souls originate as well as find eternal rest. But those who stray from there, exiled into 
the fallen world, eventually find themselves naked and in need of repair by the field 
master. This figure represents the Tzaddik in general and Messiah ben Joseph in par- 
ticular. The role of Messiah ben Joseph is to pave the way for the arrival of Messiah 
ben David, the heavenly Messiah, who will initiate the End of Days. It is the fate of 
Messiah ben Joseph to die while engaged in his messianic task. See "The Two Messi- 
ahs," p. 517. 

Thus Rabbi Nachman's allegory is essentially a reaffirmation of the need to long 
and pray for the coming of the Messiah, who will repair all souls in need of repair. 



THE TREASURY OF SOULS 169 


Such a messianic figure is portrayed in Rabbi Nachman's famous tale "The Master of 
Prayers" in Sippurei Ma'asiyot. 

Rabbi Nachman asked to be buried in the city of Uman because there had been a 
great pogrom there two centuries earlier, and he wanted to assist the souls buried 
there, who he said were trapped in that place. It was his intention to guide them into 
heaven. Thus, as in most of Rabbi Nachman's stories, the Tzaddik he is alluding to in 
this allegory is himself. This also suggests that Rabbi Nachman saw himself as the 
Tzaddik ha-Dor, the leading Tzaddik of his generation, who was the potential Messiah 
ben Joseph of his generation.

203. THE TRANSMIGRATION OF SOULS 

After death a man's soul undergoes up to four transformations. First, it crosses the sea. 
And if the soul falls there, it enters the body of a fish. And if that fish is caught, and 
someone cooks and eats that fish after saying the proper blessing, that soul is spared its 
suffering and ascends to the Garden of Eden. 

Then there are the souls that cross the ocean and pass above the trees. If the soul falls 
and enters a fruit-bearing tree, and if those fruits are later picked and blessings pro- 
nounced on them, that soul also enters the Garden of Eden, its sufferings at an end. 

So too are there souls that pass over the crops, such as wheat. If the soul enters the 
wheat and bread is made of it, and the blessings are said over it, that soul is also saved. 
But if the soul enters crops that are eaten by animals, it remains in sorrow. For if an 
animal eats the crops containing this soul, it enters the animal. It suffers there until the 
animal is slaughtered and blessings are made over the food. And that is the soul's last 
chance of being saved from its suffering. For if it is not saved, it will continue to suffer 
until the End of Days. But if it is saved, its soul will be saved from great suffering, and it 
will make its home in the Garden of Eden. Otherwise it will be condemned to wait until 
the footsteps of the Messiah are heard. 

Beginning with the Safed kabbalists in the sixteenth century, the concept of metem- 
psychosis, the transmigration of souls, becomes a central principle in Judaism known 
as gilgul. The ultimate goal of the soul, from this perspective, is to be freed from the 
cycle of reincarnation, much as the goal in Hinduism is to achieve Nirvana and be 
freed from any further rebirths. 

The fate of the soul as outlined here involves great suffering. And an even worse 
punishment awaits those souls whose sins were so great that avenging angels chase 
them from one place to the next. When such a wandering spirit takes possession of a 
living person, it is known as a dybbuk. See, for example, "The Widow of Safed," p. 228. 

For an example of the freeing of a soul from gilgul , see "The Sabbath Fish," in Gabriel's 
Palace, pp. 233-234. See also S. Ansky's folk drama. The Dybbuk. 

Sefer ha-Likutim , edited by Binyamin ha-Levi and Elisha Vestali, p. 175, based on 
teachings of Hayim Vital, suggests that the righteous may go through gilgul for a thou- 
sand generations, while the unjust do so for only three. This is because those who 
were learned in Torah are said to be protected from entering Gehenna, where sins are 
purified through the punishments of hell. Yet even the righteous accumulate sins that 
need to be cleansed, so the process of gilgul serves to purify their souls. But the unjust 
enter hell after only three generations and have their sins cleansed there.

204. HOW TO GRASP A SOUL 

Just as something physical can be grasped by holding on to it, so one can grasp a soul by 
calling its name. 

Calling upon souls is an essential part of kabbalah, especially practical kabbalah. 

Souls are invoked to answer questions or to assist in some earthly or heavenly task. 

Here the secret of calling upon a soul and compelling it to respond is revealed— the 
power is in knowing the spirit's name. Once called upon by name, the spirits cannot 
resist coming forth to answer the call.

205. ADAM IS TAKEN INTO PARADISE 

When Adam was old, he called his son Seth to him and said: "Hear these words, my son. 
All that I am going to tell you is true. One day, not long after your mother and I had been 
expelled from Paradise, as we finished our prayers, I had a vision: I saw a chariot like the 
wind and its wheels were fiery. Before I knew it, I was caught up into Paradise. There I 
saw the Lord seated on a mighty throne, and the flames cast from His face could not be 
endured. Many thousands of angels were there, on each side of the chariot. 

I was seized with terror, and I bowed down before God, and God said, 'Because you 
transgressed My commandment, the time has come for you to die.' When I heard these 
words, I fell prone and said, 'Master of the Universe! Do not cast me out of your presence, 
I whom You shaped out of dust. Do not banish what You Yourself nourished.' 

"God said, 'Fear not, because of your love of knowledge, your seed will always be 
with Me.' And when I heard these words, I prostrated myself before God and said, 'You 
are the eternal and supreme God. You are the true Light shining above all lights. May it 
be Your will to bestow abundance on the race of men.' 

"Then, as soon as I finished speaking, the angel Michael seized my hand and brought 
me out of Paradise. He touched the waters surrounding Paradise with his rod, and they 
froze in place. And Michael and I crossed over the frozen waters, and led me back to this 
world. That is when the vision came to an end. Nor did I die on that day." 

This myth about Adam is a good example of a Merkavah myth. Adam not only has 
a vision of the Divine Chariot, as does Ezekiel, but he is taken up into heaven in it, as 
later happened to Enoch and Elijah, and he has a heavenly vision. Note that the vision 
takes place not long after Adam's expulsion from Eden. God tells him of his impend- 
ing doom, but then spares him, and reveals that he will be the first of a long line. 

This account of Adam's vision makes Adam the first one to take such a heavenly 
journey. But while Enoch's journey into Paradise is well known, this myth about Adam, 
found in Vita Adae et Evae, is somewhat obscure. In fact, mythic accounts of such heav- 
enly journeys can be found for Adam, Enoch, the patriarchs, and Moses, as well as 
several of the rabbinic sages. 



HEAVENLY JOURNEYS 


171 


Here Adam reports a vision involving a heavenly journey and an encounter with 
God. It is not clear whether it was a journey of the soul or a bodily ascent. In the 
former, a person remains on earth while his soul ascends on high; in the latter, the 
mystic literally ascends to heaven. Most of these accounts are best understood as soul 
journeys, but this may be an exception, based on the description of how he was taken 
into the chariot by the angel Michael and brought into Paradise. See "The Ascent of 
Elijah," p. 172.

206. ISAAC'S ASCENT 

When the knife touched Isaac's throat, his soul flew from him. While his body lay on the 
stone altar, his soul ascended on high, rising up through the palaces of heaven. And the 
angels on high brought Isaac's soul to the celestial academy of Shem and Eber. There he 
remained for three years, studying the Torah, for in this way Isaac was rewarded for all 
he had suffered when he was about to be slain. 

So too were all the Treasuries of Heaven opened to Isaac: the celestial Temple, which has 
existed there since the time of Creation, the Chambers of the Chariot, and all of the palaces of 
heaven; all the Treasuries of Ice and Snow, as well as the Treasury of Prayers, and the Trea- 
sury of Souls. There Isaac saw how he had descended from the seed of Adam. So too was he 
permitted to see the future generations that would arise from the seed of Abraham. Even the 
End of Days was revealed, for no mystery of heaven was deemed too secret for the pure soul 
of Isaac. There, too, Isaac found his own face on the curtain of God known as the Pargod. 

During all this time Abraham remained frozen in place, the knife in his upraised hand. 
But to him it seemed but a single breath. Then the angel spoke: "Lay not your hand upon 
the lad," and at that instant Isaac's soul returned to his body. And when Isaac found that 
his soul had been restored to him, he exclaimed: "Blessed is He who quickens the dead!" 
And when Abraham unbound him, Isaac arose, seeing the world as if for the first time, as 
if he had been reborn. 

Although it is clearly stated in Genesis 22:12 that the angel of the Lord commanded 
Abraham not to raise his hand against Isaac, this late midrash, which may well echo 
Christian influence, asserts that Abraham did in fact slay Isaac, and that Isaac's soul 
ascended to Paradise, where he studied in the academy of Shem and Eber. The basis of 
this midrash is the conclusion of the Akedah episode of the binding of Isaac, where it is 
Abraham alone who returns to his servants, and no mention is made of Isaac (Gen. 
22:19). The themes of dying and resurrection here echo the Christian belief in the death 
and resurrection of Jesus. The similarity of the three days after the death of Jesus when 
the resurrection takes place, and the three years in this midrash about Isaac underscores 
the parallel. This legend about the ascent of Isaac is linked to the Resurrection of the 
Dead by adding that when Isaac arose, "He knew that in this way the dead would come 
back to life in the future, whereupon he began to recite, 'Blessed are You, O Lord, who 
quickens the dead'" (Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 31). For further discussion of the legends of 
the Akedah , the Binding of Isaac, see The Last Trial by Shalom Spiegel. 

The academy of Shem and Eber is often referred to in the Midrash. Abraham is said 
to have told Sarah that he was taking Isaac to study there at the time he set off for Mount 
Moriah (Sefer ha-Yashar 43a-44b). While this academy may once have been on earth, in 
most rabbinic legends it is identified as the academy on high. Therefore Isaac's ascent to 
Paradise to study in this academy verifies Abraham's statement to Sarah, affirming his 
honesty. The origin of this legend is the identification of the tents of Shem in Genesis 9:27 
with a Beit Midrash or House of Study, which evolved in midrashic literature into an 



172 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


academy led by Shem and his great-grandson Eber. Later legends identify the academy 
as a heavenly one, where the greatest sages study. There also is a strong identification of 
prophecy with Shem, who was said to have had the gift of prophecy. Note that in the 
midrash this "academy" existed long before the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai, 
underscoring the rabbinic belief of the pre-existence of the Torah. 

This myth finds it fullest form in "The Akedah," a medieval piyyut by Ephraim ben 
Jacob of Bonn.

207. THE ASCENT OF ELIJAH 

When the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha 
had set out from Gilgal. Elijah said to Elisha, "Stay here, for the Lord has sent me on to 
Bethel." "As the Lord lives and as you live," said Elisha, "I will not leave you." So they 
went down to Bethel. Disciples of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and said to 
him. Do you know that the Lord will take your master away from you today?" He 
replied, "I know it, too; be silent." 

Then Elijah said to him, "Elisha, stay here, for the Lord has sent me on to Jericho." "As 
the Lord lives and as you live," said Elisha, "I will not leave you." So they went on to 
Jericho. The disciples of the prophets who were at Jericho came over to Elisha and said to 
him, "Do you know that the Lord will take your master away from you today?" He 
replied, "I know it, too; be silent." 

Elijah said to him, "Stay here, for the Lord has sent me on to the Jordan." "As the Lord 
lives and as you live, I will not leave you," he said, and the two of them went on. Fifty 
men of the disciples of the prophets followed and stood by at a distance from them as the 
two stopped at the Jordan. Thereupon Elijah took his mantle and, rolling it up, he struck 
the water; it divided to the right and left, so that the two of them crossed over on dry 
land. As they were crossing, Elijah said to Elisha, "Tell me, what can I do for you before I 
am taken from you?" Elisha answered, "Let a double portion of your spirit pass on to 
me." "You have asked a difficult thing," he said. "If you see me as I am being taken from 
you, this will be granted to you; if not, it will not." As they kept on walking and talking, 
a fiery chariot with fiery horses suddenly appeared and separated one from the other; 
and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind. Elisha saw it, and he cried out, "Oh, father, 
father! Israel's chariots and horsemen!" When he could no longer see him, he grasped his 
garments and rent them in two. 

The ascent of Elijah is the primary model for all subsequent accounts of heavenly 
journeys. This even includes the tradition about Enoch having been taken up into 
heaven in a fiery chariot, based on the interpretations of Enoch walked with God; then he 
was no more, for God took him (Gen. 5:24). The talmudic tale of the four who entered 
Pardes (B. Hagigah 14b) is also indebted to the ascent imagery of this biblical account. 

See "The Four Who Entered Paradise," following. 

As important as is the ascent of Elijah, equally important is the loyalty of Elisha, 
demonstrated here, and the transfer of Elijah's mantle to his disciple.

208. THE FOUR WHO ENTERED PARADISE 

Four sages entered Paradise — Ben Azzai, Ben Zoma, Aher, and Rabbi Akiba. Ben Azzai 
looked and died. Ben Zoma looked and lost his mind. Aher cut himself off from his fa- 
thers and became an apostate. Only Rabbi Akiba entered and departed in peace. 

It is said that when Ben Azzai passed through the palaces of heaven and saw with his 
own eyes the glory of the celestial palace, his body could not endure it, and his soul could 
not tear itself away, for he felt that he had returned to his true home at last. And that is 
how he took leave of this world. 

About Aher it is said that when he ascended on high, he reached the realm of the angel 
Metatron, whom he saw seated on a throne. In great confusion he cried out "There are — 
God forbid — two powers in heaven!" and from that moment he lost his faith. Then God 
commanded Metatron to be lashed sixty times with a fiery whip for not showing Aher 
that he was wrong. 

In those days Ben Zoma was seen walking down a road by a rabbi and his students. 
They greeted him, but Ben Zoma did not respond. Finally the rabbi asked, "Where have 
you been, Ben Zoma?" And Ben Zoma replied: "I was contemplating the Mysteries of 
Creation. I learned that between the upper waters and the lower waters there are but 
three finger-breadths." Hearing this, the rabbi said to his students: "Ben Zoma is gone." 
Nor did Ben Zoma live long after that. 

When Rabbi Akiba ascended to heaven, he made signs at the entrance of heaven so 
that he could find his way back. When he arrived at the Pargod, the celestial curtain, the 
angels of destruction came out to injure him. Then a heavenly voice issued from beneath 
the throne of glory, which said, "Leave this elder alone. He is worthy of gazing at My 
glory." And there, in the highest heaven, before the Throne of Glory, God's holy and 
secret Name was revealed to him. 

Four sages entered Paradise. But only Rabbi Akiba ascended on high, passed through 
the palaces of heaven, and descended in peace. 

This brief, ambiguous legend about the four sages who entered Pardes is one of the 
central mystical tales in the Jewish tradition. It became the focus of opposing tradi- 
tions — those who saw it as the model for mystical contemplation and heavenly as- 
cent, as found in the Hekhalot texts, and those who saw in its conclusion, in which 
three of the four greatest talmudic sages are somehow harmed, a warning that such 
contemplation and/or ascent was gravely dangerous and that the study of mystical 
texts should be limited to those who were well-grounded. But the tale of the four who 
entered Paradise (for this is how it was commonly understood) impressed others in 
an entirely different way. For this legend also became an entry into the mysteries of 
Pardes by an esoteric Jewish sect, who sought, by engaging in mystical contemplation, 
to discover the means to enter Pardes , which represented the heavenly Paradise. This 
is a form of contemplation of Ma'aseh Merkavah , or of the Mysteries of the Chariot, and 
such mystical ascent is paradoxically identified as a descent. The writings produced 
by this sect are called Hekhalot texts, since they describe travels through the palaces 
(Hekhalot) of heaven. They were written either to record their mystical experiences or 
to prepare a guidebook for ascent. To a large extent, the very ambiguity of the legend 
of the four sages is the reason for its primacy. Many have wondered what Ben Azzai 
saw that caused him to lose his life, what Ben Zoma saw that caused him to lose his 
mind, and what Elisha ben Abuyah (Aher) saw that caused him to "cut the shoots," 
i.e., become an apostate. There are clues in the Talmud concerning the fates of Ben 
Zoma and Aher , while the clues about Ben Azzai are found in Leviticus Rabbah and 
Song of Songs Rabbah, as noted. Ben Azzai's mysterious death has been linked to the 
mystical tradition of those who give up their souls without reservation during a mys- 
tical experience. This is equivalent to dying by the Kiss of the Shekhinah, as Moses did. 



174 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


Gershom Scholem speculates that the Hekhalot sect actively engaged in techniques to 
induce mystical experiences/ including the use of yogalike positions/ and the singing 
of rhythmical hymns in unison for long periods of time. Standard Jewish practices of 
purification were also used, including the mikveh (ritual bath), fasting, and extensive 
prayer. Emphasis was also placed on the power of the word — on prayers, on amulets 
containing invocations, and, above all, the secret pronunciation of the Divine Name. 

One of the unanswered questions about the heavenly ascent of the four sages is 
whether it was a bodily ascent or a soul ascent. Ben Zoma, for example, indicates that 
he knows exactly how much space exists between the upper waters and the lower 
waters. Did he gain this knowledge firsthand, by ascending to that place? An indica- 
tion of the answer is found in Midrash Tehillim 19:4, where Rabbi Samuel bar Abba is 
quoted as having said, "I know the lanes of heaven as well as the lanes of Nehardea" 
(a city in Babylonia, the seat of a rabbinic academy). This midrash asks if Samuel 
meant that he had actually gone up into the firmament. The answer is no — rather, 
laboring at Torah's wisdom he learned from it what is in the firmament. Likewise, 
Rabbi Hoshaiah is quoted as saying, "Even as there is an empty space between the 
lower waters and the firmament, so there is an empty space between the upper waters 
and the firmament." The midrash again asks if Rabbi Hoshaiah meant that he had 
actually gone up into the upper heavens? The answer is no— by laboring at Torah's 
wisdom, he learned from it all that is in the upper heavens. 

An interesting oral variant of the myth of the four who entered Paradise is IFA 
13901. The four rabbis in this Moroccan story find the opportunity to go to heaven on 
Sukkot, when the sky opens for an instant, and an angel invites them to study kabbalah 
in Paradise. The fact that the four were invited to make this journey means their great- 
ness had been recognized in Heaven, and that is why they were able to make such a 
blessed journey.

209. A VISION OF METATRON 

There were four who entered Paradise. Elisha ben Abuyah was one of them. He ascended 
on high to gaze at the Merkavah, the Divine Chariot. When he reached the door of the 
seventh palace, he came into the presence of the angel Metatron, who was seated upon a 
high and lofty throne, wearing a crown. All the princes of the kingdom stood beside him, 
to his right and to his left, and from his throne Metatron ruled over all the other heavenly 



HEAVENLY JOURNEYS 175 


beings. Seeing this, Elisha began to quake, and his soul was confused and filled with 
fright. For Metatron was seated upon that throne like a king, with all the ministering 
angels standing by him as he presided over the Celestial Court and all the angels. In that 
instant Elisha opened his mouth and cried, "God forbid, there must be two powers in 
heaven!" Thereupon a heavenly voice went forth to say, "Return, you backsliding chil- 
dren, all except Aherl" 

After that God commanded the angel Anafiel to punish Metatron with sixty fiery lashes 
for not rising when he saw Elisha ben Abuyah, thus giving Elisha the false impression 
that there were two heavenly powers. As for Elisha, thereafter he became known as Aher, 
the Other, for at the instant he saw Metatron seated there, he lost his faith. 

The two primary versions of this myth about Aher (Elisha ben Abuyah) becoming an 
apostate are found in the Talmud in B. Hagigah 15a and in 3 Enoch. Elisha's shock on 
seeing Metatron in heaven derives primarily from the fact that he is seated, since he had 
believed that no sitting was allowed in heaven except for God, seated on His Throne of 
Glory. Thus Elisha identifies Metatron as a "Lesser Yahweh," a demiurgic figure. And for 
the Enoch sect, in particular, Enoch/Metatron does play a remarkably extensive role, for 
he serves as chief of the angels who carries out all of God's commands. 

The rabbinic explanation for Metatron's being seated is that he is the heavenly 
scribe, whose job it is to record the merits of Israel. The version in 3 Enoch elaborates 
on the godlike role Metatron plays, surrounded by ministering angels. Metatron's 
punishment of sixty fiery lashes demonstrates his subservience to God. It seems likely 
that Elisha's apostasy led him to become a Gnostic, whose primary belief was that 
there are two powers in heaven. 

This myth is directly modeled after Daniel 7, where Daniel has a vision of the Ancient 
of Days, one of the names of God. Daniel's vision itself is directly based on Isaiah's vision 
in Isaiah 6:1-8. Here, however, Metatron has taken the place of God in Elisha's vision. This 
shows the extreme nature of the Metatron mythology, in which Metatron's role some- 
times seems to eclipse that of God. Here, ironically, this is done by drawing on a biblical 
model. The talmudic version of this myth was likely intended as a warning against 
Gnosticism in general and speculations about Enoch/Metatron in particular. This ac- 
cusation finds its answer in 3 Enoch , dating from around the eighth century. It is fasci- 
nating to observe how this talmudic warning myth is incorporated in 3 Enoch into the 
overall myth of Metatron, and slanted in a way to demonstrate that Elisha ben Abuyah 
failed to recognize Metatron's true role as God's second in command. But at the same 
time the myth is certainly intended to elevate the primary role of Metatron in the 
heavenly pantheon to one who is second only to God. See "The Four Who Entered 
Paradise," p. 173. 

Anafiel, the angel who punishes Metatron, is the same angel who brought Enoch 
into heaven, where the metamorphosis into Metatron took place. Anafiel YHVH is 
one of the eight princes of heaven whose names include the Tetragrammaton, sug- 
gesting that they are an extension of God. Metatron's power is over all of the angels 
except for these eight princes.

176 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


210. RABBI ISHMAEL'S ASCENT 

One of the Roman emperors called in ten of the finest sages and demanded to study the 
Torah with them. They began at the beginning of Genesis, and all went well until they 
reached the passage in Exodus that reads. He who kidnaps a man , whether he has sold him or 
is still holding him, shall be put to death (Exod. 21: 16). When he read this, the Emperor 
remembered how Joseph's brothers had sold him into slavery. Yet they had not been 
punished by death, as the law required. 

The Emperor asked the sages if this ruling applied to Joseph's brothers, and they agreed 
that it did. Then he demanded that the law r be fulfilled and the executions carried out. 
The sages tried to explain that Joseph's brothers had died long ago. The Emperor told 
them that he knew that the brothers could no longer be punished. But in that case, the 
punishment must be carried out on those who represented Joseph's brothers in that age. 
And he pointed to each of the ten sages and told them that surely none represented the 
leaders of the tribes of Israel more than they did. 

Then the Emperor signed a decree commanding that the ten sages be put to death, 
among them Rabbi Akiba, Rabbi Ishmael, Rabbi Hananiah ben Teradion, and seven other 
of the greatest sages who ever lived. 

All of the sages were placed in a cell together, so that none might escape before the 
execution was carried out. There in that cell they turned to Rabbi Ishmael and begged 
him to use the power of the Name to overturn the Emperor's decree, for they knew that 
he alone could do it. Rabbi Ishmael told them that he could indeed overturn the decree, 
but first they must find out if it was solely that of the Emperor, or if in condemning them 
the Emperor was carrying out a decree of the Holy One, blessed be He. 

Then Rabbi Ishmael put on his tallit and tefillin and chanted a long prayer. And as he 
prayed, his soul ascended to the sixth heaven, where the angel Gabriel greeted him and 
asked to know why he had come there. Rabbi Ishmael told him of the Emperor's decree, 
and that he had ascended to learn if it were a Divine decree or not. 

Then Gabriel swore that he had heard the decree pronounced from behind the Pargod, 
the heavenly curtain. But he told Rabbi Ishmael not to mourn, for the ten sages would 
shortly be reunited in Paradise. Meanwhile their martyrdom would free the world from 
the evil that had entered it when Joseph's brothers sold him into slavery. And when that 
terrible sin had been lifted from the world, one of the chains that held back the Messiah 
would be broken, and the days of the Messiah would be that much closer. Rabbi Ishmael 
was greatly comforted to learn this and accepted his fate at once. Then he and the angel 
Gabriel took their leave of each other, and Rabbi Ishmael returned to this world. 

When he opened his eyes. Rabbi Ishmael saw that all of the other sages had gathered 
around him, waiting for his soul to return from on high. He told them at once all he had 
learned from the lips of the angel Gabriel. And when the other sages learned that they 
had been chosen to lift the sin of Joseph's brothers from the world, and to break one of 
the chains of the Messiah, they embraced their destiny. And one by one they went bravely 
to their deaths. 

While most texts describing heavenly journeys make the ascent the focus of the 
tale, "Rabbi Ishmael's Ascent" is a portion of a longer midrashic narrative known as 
"The Legend of the Ten Martyrs." Here ten of the most famous Jewish martyrs, in- 
cluding Rabbi Akiba and Rabbi Ishmael, are linked as victims of the same evil decree, 
even though historically they did not all live at the same time. Rabbi Ishmael then 
undertakes an ascent into Paradise to discover if this is actually a heavenly decree or 
not. If not, he has it within his power to overthrow the Emperor's decree by drawing 
on the power of God's Name. So far the tale reads like a fairy tale. If it had followed 
this pattern. Rabbi Ishmael would have learned that it was not a heavenly decree, and 
on his return he would have defeated the Emperor, saving himself and his fellow 
sages. But this account has fused the Hekhalot-type tale of ascent with the accounts of 
the deaths of these great sages culled from rabbinic sources, primarily from the Tal- 



HEAVENLY JOURNEYS 177 


mud. Thus Rabbi Ishmael learns that heaven has approved the decree against the 
sages to erase the sin of Joseph's brothers in selling Joseph. Note that this explanation 
gives the deaths of the sages cosmic meaning, in righting what was perceived as an 
epic wrong in the Torah, in which Joseph's brothers are never punished for selling 
him into slavery. For it is clearly stated in the Torah that the punishment for such a sin 
is death: He who kidnaps a man , whether he has sold him or is still holding him , shall be put 
to death (Exod. 21:16). In "The Legend of the Ten Martyrs," it is the emperor who has 
commanded the sages to teach him the Bible, and it is the emperor who raises the 
question of whether or not Joseph's brothers were punished. But this was clearly a 
question on the minds of the rabbis, who scrutinized the events prior to the giving of 
the Torah for evidence that the laws were fulfilled. And even though the Emperor's 
linking of the sins of Joseph's brothers with the ten sages seems arbitrary and unrea- 
sonable, Hayim Vital states in Etz Hayim that the souls of the ten martyrs were bom 
from ten drops of semen that came forth from Joseph, suggesting that for the kabbalists, 
at least, there was some justification to the Emperor's charge. 

Also, the rabbis sought precedents for evil behavior in the biblical text. For ex- 
ample, they wanted to know how Cain died, which is not reported. In fact, there are 
four different versions of how Cain died that are found in the aggadic texts. See "The 
Death of Cain," p. 451. In "Rabbi Ishmael's Ascent" it is therefore possible to see the 
imprint of four basic kinds of Jewish narratives combined into one: 1) the tale of as- 
cent; 2) the linking tale, which links key figures from various generations into a chain 
midrash; 3) the tale that responds to a specific point of the Law, in this case the pun- 
ishment required for the sin of Joseph's brothers; and 4) the martyrological tale. 

* In addition, this tale can be seen to have major theological ramifications. It shifts 
the blame for the Roman oppression to God, much in the same way that the myth of 
the Ari shifts the blame for the Fall from Adam and Eve to God. This is a natural 
consequence of monotheism: if there is only one God, then everything that takes place 
must have been brought into being by that God, including evil acts. One strange no- 
tion found in this important tale is that it would be possible, indeed expected by God, 
that anyone other than Joseph's brothers be punished for their sin. Yet this is what the 
tale implies. This is an essentially kabbalistic premise. The sin of Joseph's brothers has 
cosmic implications; it created a taint in existence, much in the way that the person of 
Cain is transformed into a principle of evil in the kabbalah. Therefore the deaths of 
the ten martyrs have a meaning that transcends their earthly loss: a major taint has 
been removed from the world. From this perspective the deaths represent a monu- 
mental sacrifice, which has the effect of serving as a cosmic act of tikkun, of repair and 
restoration. (Note that this sacrifice has Christian overtones.) 

The accounts of the deaths of the rabbis, drawn from diverse time periods and sources, 
are very moving. For example. Rabbi Haninah ben Teradion was burned along with the 
Torah: "They took him, wrapped him in the scroll of the Torah, placed bundles of branches 

around him and set him on fire His disciples called out, 'Rabbi, what do You see?' 

He answered: 'The parchments are being burnt but the letters are soaring on high'" (B. 
A.Z. 18a). The other rabbis who were martyred, in addition to Rabbi Ishmael, Rabbi 
Akiba, and Rabbi Haninah ben Teradion, include Rabbi Simeon ben Gamaliel, Rabbi 
Yehudah ben Bava, Rabbi Yehudah ben Dema, Rabbi Hutzpit, Rabbi Haninah ben 
Hakhinai, Rabbi Yeshvav the scribe, and Rabbi Eleazar ben Shammua. Midrash Eleh 
Ezkerah includes an interesting myth about Rabbi Ishmael that identifies the angel Gabriel 
as his true father. This myth makes the meeting of Rabbi Ishmael and Gabriel in Para- 
dise much more meaningful. See "How Rabbi Ishmael Was Conceived," p. 201.

211. THE ENTRANCE OF THE SIXTH HEAVENLY PALACE 

Those who ascend on high must beware at the entrance of the sixth hekhal , the sixth 
heavenly palace. It appears as if it were engulfed by a sea of waves, but anyone who cries 
out, "Water, water!" is in grave danger. For there is not even a drop of water, only the 
radiance of pure marble stones, more awe-inspiring than water. Furthermore, the door- 
keepers of the sixth palace destroy all those who arrive there without permission. 

Those warlike doorkeepers, the angels Dumiel and Kaspiel, are taller than mountains, 
and sharper than peaks. Their bows are strung and stand before them; their swords are 
sharpened and in their hands. Lightning issues forth from their eyes, and spider webs of 
fire from their nostrils, and torches of fiery coals from their mouths. And they are equipped 
with helmets and coats of mail, and javelins and spears are hung upon their muscles. 
These gatekeepers would destroy all those who arrive there without permission. 

It is said of Ben Azzai that he reached the entrance of the sixth heavenly palace and 
saw the radiance of the light of the pure marble stones. He called out, "Water, water," and 
in a wink the doorkeeper who guards that gate cut off his head. This became a sign for all 
generations, not to err at the entrance of the sixth hekhal 

Only those who are protected by the angel Lumiel by reason of righteousness will be 
able to pass beyond the doorkeeper of the sixth palace. For the angel bears a gift for those 
who deserve it. It is not a gift of silver and not a gift of gold, but it grants the one who 
"descends" to the Merkavah the privilege that he should not be questioned, not in the first 
palace and not in the second, not in the third palace and not in the fourth, and not in the 
fifth palace or the sixth, and not in the seventh. But Lumiel shows the seal to the proper 
angels, and the one who ascends is able to go on to the next gate. 

Of all the dangers of trying to ascend to Paradise (paradoxically known as "de- 
scending to the Merkavah "), the greatest lurks at the entrance of the sixth gate. This 
gate is guarded by the dangerous angels Dumiel (Divine silence) and Kaspiel (Divine 
wrath). In Hekhalot Rabbati the death of Ben Azzai recorded in B. Hagigah 14b is re- 
counted as having taken place at the sixth gate, when the doorkeeper cut off his head. 

(Other texts offer different explanations, most of them less violent.) The secret to pass- 
ing beyond the gate of the sixth heaven and thereby being able to enter the seventh 
heaven, Aravot, is held by the angel Lumiel, who bears a seal that makes it possible to 
pass beyond all of the doorkeepers without being questioned. This seal is only avail- 
able to the very righteous. This would suggest that of the four sages who entered 
Paradise, as recounted in B. Hagigah 14b, only Rabbi Akiba, who entered and departed 
in peace, was righteous enough to deserve this seal. Hekhalot Rabbati asks: "What is it 
like to know the secret of the Merkavah ? It is like having a ladder in one's house and 
being able to go up and down at will." Gershom Scholem has found an echo of the 
these heavenly gatekeepers in Kafka's famous parable, "Before the Law." See this story 
on p. 179. See "The Four Who Entered Paradise," p. 173.

212. BEFORE THE LAW 

Before the Law stands a man guarding the door. To this doorkeeper comes a man from 
the country who asks to be admitted to the Law. But the doorkeeper says that he cannot 
grant him entry. The man thinks about it and asks if, in that case, he will be permitted to 
enter later. "Possibly," says the doorkeeper, "but not now." 

As the gateway to the Law is, as always, open, and the doorkeeper steps aside, the 
man stoops to look within. When the doorkeeper sees this, he laughs and says, "If it 
tempts you that much, just try to get in. But be aware that I am mighty. And I am only the 
lowliest doorkeeper. From hall to hall there are doorkeepers, each mightier than the one 
before. Even I can no longer bear the sight of the third of these." 

The man from the country has not expected such difficulties. Surely, he thinks, the 
Law ought to be accessible to everybody, always, but now as he looks more carefully at 
the doorkeeper, with his big pointed nose and long, thin, black Tatar beard, he decides 
he'd rather wait for permission to enter. The doorkeeper gives him a stool and has him sit 
down beside the door. There he sits for days and for years. He often tries to be admitted, 
and wearies the doorkeeper with his pleas. The doorkeeper frequently questions him, 
asks him about where he comes from and many other things, but they are distant inquir- 
ies, the sort great men make, and in the end he always says that he cannot let him in yet. 
The man, who has equipped himself for his journey with many things, employs every- 
thing, however valuable, to bribe the doorkeeper. He takes it all, saying however, "I ac- 
cept this only so you won't think you've failed to do anything." 

All these long years the man watches the doorkeeper unceasingly. He forgets the other 
doorkeepers, and this first one seems to be the only obstacle between him and the Law. He 
curses his miserable luck, at first recklessly and loudly; later, as he grows old, he only 
grumbles to himself. He becomes childish, and since his years of scrutiny of the door- 
keeper have enabled him to recognize even the fleas in his fur collar, he asks even the fleas 
to help change the doorkeeper's mind. Finally his eyes grow feeble, and he doesn't know if 
it's really getting darker around him or if his eyes are only tricking him. But in the darkness 
he now observes an inextinguishable radiance streaming out of the door of the Law. 

Now he will not live much longer. Before he dies all he has been through converges in 
his mind into one question that he has never yet asked the doorkeeper. He signals to him, 
as he can no longer raise his stiffening body. The doorkeeper has to bend down low to 
him, as their difference in size has altered, much to the man's disadvantage. "What do 
you want to know now?" asks the doorkeeper. "There's no satisfying you." "Everyone 
struggles to reach the Law," says the man. "How can it be that in all these years no one 
but me has asked to get in?" The doorkeeper recognizes that the man's life is almost over 
and, because his hearing is failing, he roars at him, "No one else could be allowed in here. 
This entrance was intended only for you. I am now going to close it." 

This famous parable by Kafka from The Trial can be read as a religious allegory or 
as an allegory of human justice. Although it is generally thought of more in terms of 
the latter, it has the distinct elements of a religious allegory. The key image is that "of 
an inextinguishable radiance streaming out of the door of the Law." This clearly sug- 
gests the eternal nature of the Law, which, of course, draws this eternal quality from 
God. This shifts the focus of the parable from human justice to the need for divine 
justice, and hints at the remoteness of God. 

The doorkeeper guarding the gate to the Law is reminiscent of the angel placed at 
the gate of the Garden of Eden, with the flaming sword that turned every way, to 
guard the way to the tree of life (Gen. 3:24). Also echoed is the popular Christian concep- 
tion of St. Peter serving as the doorkeeper at the Gates of Heaven. 



180 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


Gershom Scholem has said that there are three pillars of Jewish mystical thought: 
the Bible, the Zohar, and the writings of Kafka. Thus he viewed Kafka's writings, which 
have been interpreted in a multitude of ways, as mystical texts. Scholem pointed out 
parallels between "Before the Law" and passages in the Hekhalot texts about angels 
guarding the gates of the palaces of heaven. For a description of these angels, see "The 
Entrance of the Sixth Heavenly Palace," p. 178. Compare this description with Kafka's 
description of the doorkeeper in "Before the Law." The parallels are striking, but since 
this Hekhalot text was little known during Kafka's lifetime, it is not likely that he had 
direct knowledge of it. Moshe Idel also identifies the quest in this tale as the remnant 
of a mystical one. See Kabbalah: New Perspectives, p. 271. 

Another perspective is suggested by Zohar 1:7b: Open the gates of righteousness for 
me — This is the gateway to the Lord (Ps. 68:19-20). Assuredly, without entering through 
that gate one will never gain access to the most high King. Imagine a king greatly 
exalted who screens himself from the common view behind gate upon gate, and at the 
end, one special gate, locked and barred. Said the king: "He who wishes to enter into 
my presence must first of all pass through that gate." 

Another parallel is found in Ibn Gabirol's eleventh century treatise. The Book of the 
Selection of Pearls (ch. 8): "The following laconic observations are said to have been 
addressed to a king, by one who stood by the gate of the royal palace, but who failed 
to obtain access. First: Necessity and hope prompted me to approach your throne. 
Second: My dire distress admits of no delay. Third: My disappointment would gratify 
the malice of my enemies. Fourth: Your acquiescence would confer advantages, and 
even your refusal would relieve me from anxiety and suspense." 

Max Brod, Kafka's close friend and biographer, comments about this parable: 
"Kafka's deeply ironic legend 'Before the Law' is not the reminiscence or retelling of 
this ancient lore, as it would seem at first glance, but an original creation drawn deeply 
from his archaic soul. It is yet another proof of his profound roots in Judaism, whose 
potency and creative images rose to new activities in his unconscious." ( Johannes 
Reuchlin und sein Kampf, Stuttgart: 1965, pp. 274-275). 

Of course, "Before the Law" can also be read as a personal statement of the kind of 
obstruction Kafka experienced at the hands of his father. The role of the gatekeeper can 
also be identified with Kafka's mother, for Kafka gave^ds mother the epic letter he wrote 
to his father, to pass on to him, but she decided not to do so. In such a reading Kafka's 
father represents the Law, the strict, godlike figure. See Kafka's Letter to His Father. 

Also, Kafka's parable is relevant to human justice, where, on many occasions, people 
have been denied justice by the very ones who were supposed to provide it for them. 
In doing so they perform the obstructive role of the gatekeeper, who was supposed to 
welcome the man from the country at the gate intended only for him, but instead 
prevented him from entering at all. 

Readers may wonder why a modem parable by Franz Kafka has been included in a 
book of Jewish mythology. There are several reasons for this. Kafka's fiction possesses a 
strong mythic element, and scholars have become increasingly aware of the strong in- 
fluence on it of Jewish tradition; Kafka's writing in general, and this parable in particu- 
lar, has taken on the qualities of a sacred text in our time; and there are strong parallels 
between this parable and traditional Jewish myths about the quest to reach God, but 
also a strong element of doubt in Kafka's parable that reflects the modern era. Just as the 
evolution of Jewish mythology did not end with the canonization of the Bible or the 
Talmud, and continued to flourish in the kabbalistic and hasidic era, so too it can be 
seen to continue in the modem era in the writings of Kafka. It also can be found in other 
seminal Jewish authors, such as I. L. Peretz, S. Y. Agnon, Bruno Schulz, and I. B. Singer.

213. A JOURNEY TO THE STARS 

It once happened on a voyage that a giant wave picked up the ship in which Rabbah bar 
Bar Hannah was a passenger and lifted it so high that he could see the resting place of the 
smallest star. It appeared to him like a field large enough to plant forty measures of mus- 
tard seeds. And if the wave had lifted them any higher, they would have been burned by 
the heat of the star. 

The tall tales of Rabbah bar Bar Hannah recount astonishing events that occurred 
during his land and sea journeys. Here he encounters a giant wave that lifts the ship 
so high it almost reaches a star. For other examples of Rabbah's tall tales, see "Fiery 
Waves," p. 104; "Where Heaven and Earth Meet," p. 194; and "The Dead of the Desert," 
p. 471.

214. A JEWISH ICARUS 

Yozel Frandrik was a wonder child, bom in the days of the Temple. He could speak from 
the time he was bom. When he was still a child, he crept into the Temple and cut off the 
Shem ha-Meforash, the Ineffable Name of God. Then he took a knife and made a cut in his 
foot and put the Name inside it, and sewed it shut. At that instant he grew wings, and 
after that there was nothing he could not accomplish. 

He flew like a bird and ascended on high, until he was flying with the angels. But an 
angel poured water on his feet, making him impure. All at once his magic powers left 
him, his wings fell off, and he tumbled to the ground. He could not fly any more after 
that, but he never returned the Ineffable Name, and no one knows where it is to this day. 

This is a highly unusual oral myth collected in Israel by the Israel Folktale Ar- 
chives. It is a fantasy about a strange wonder child, Yozel Frandrik. He is said to have 
lived in the Temple period. In an act both daring and outrageous, he steals into the 
Temple and cuts off God's Name, YHVH, known as the Shem ha-Meforash. Using pow- 
ers of kabbalistic wizardry, he implants the Name of God in his foot, and he immedi- 
ately grows wings. Flying through the heavens, he provokes the anger of the angels, 
and one of them pours water on his foot, making him impure. This causes him to lose 
all powers and fall from heaven, just as happens to Icarus. 

Indeed, this myth has all the earmarks of a Jewish Icarus. Icarus, flying with wax 
wings created by his father, Dedalus, flew too close to the sun, causing the wings to 
melt and for him to plunge to his death. Yozel Frandrik also does forbidden things, in 
this case cutting off God's Name from the Temple, then implanting the Name in his 
foot, which is another desecration of the Name. Still, like Moses when he struck the 
rock instead of speaking to it, the magic works — the power of the Name causes Yozel 
to grow wings. In this case, his fall from heaven is not due to melting wings, but to an 
angel purposely rendering him impure, in order to sap him of his powers. This in- 
deed is what takes place, although Yozel survives. Nor does he give the Name back. 

Thus he is portrayed as unrepentant to the end. 

David J. Halperin, in a private communication, suggests another perspective: "To 
my mind, there is no doubt at all that this tale is rooted in the anti-Christian Toledot 
Yeshu tradition of the Middle Ages. Yozel Frandrik is none other than Jesus. His name 
is a corruption of 'Yeshu (ben) Pandira/ the standard rabbinic designation for Jesus. 

In the Toledot Yeshu tradition, Jesus sneaks into the Temple and learns the letters of 
God's Name from the Foundation Stone. He writes the Name on parchment, which 
he smuggles out of the Temple by concealing it in an incision he has made in his thigh. 

Later he flies up to heaven; Rabbi Judah Ish Bartota (=Judas Iscariot, presumably) 



182 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


flies up after him. After an inconclusive aerial dogfight between the two, Judah delib- 
erately ejaculates his semen onto Jesus, with the result that Jesus becomes impure and 
falls down to earth. The parallels with 'Yozel Frandrik' seem to me overwhelming." 

In another text, Megillat Ahimaaz, a dead man is brought to life when God's Name, 
written on parchment, is implanted in his arm. However, such apparent life leaves the 
man without a soul, and unable to pronounce God's Name during prayers. It is this 
inability that gives him away. See "The Young Man Without a Soul" in Gabriel's Palace, 
pp. 145-148. A parallel use of the Name to bring the dead to life is found in the Ma'aseh 
Buck #171, where a killer is brought to life to confess his sin.

215. EZEKIEL'S VISION 

In the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, when I was in the community of 
exiles by the Chebar Canal, the heavens opened and I saw visions of God. On the fifth 
day of the month— it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin— the word of the 
Lord came to the priest Ezekiel son of Buzi, by the Chebar Canal, in the land of the 
Chaldeans. And the hand of the Lord came upon him there. 

I looked, and lo, a stormy wind came sweeping out of the north— a huge cloud and 
flashing fire, surrounded by a radiance; and in the center of it, in the center of the fire, a 
gleam as of amber. In the center of it were also the figures of four creatures. And this was 
their appearance: 

They had the figures of human beings. However, each had four faces, and each of 
them had four wings; the legs of each were fused into a single rigid leg, and the feet of 
each were like a single calf's hoof; and their sparkle was like the luster of burnished 
bronze. They had human hands below their wings. The four of them had their faces and 
their wings on their four sides. Each one's wings touched those of the other. They did not 
turn when they moved; each could move in the direction of any of its faces. 

Each of them had a human face in front; each of the four had the face of a lion on the 
right; each of the four had the face of an ox on the left; and each of the four had the face of 
an eagle at the back. Such were their faces. As for their wings, they were separated: above, 
each had two touching those of the others, while the other two covered its body. And 
each could move in the direction of any of its faces; they went wherever the spirit im- 
pelled them to go, without turning when they moved. 

Such then was the appearance of the creatures. With them was something that looked 
like burning coals of fire. This fire, suggestive of torches, kept moving about among the 
creatures; the fire had a radiance, and lightning issued from the fire. Dashing to and fro 
among the creatures was something that looked like flares. 

As I gazed on the creatures, I saw one wheel on the ground next to each of the four-faced 
creatures. As for the appearance and structure of the wheels, they gleamed like beryl. All 
four had the same form; the appearance and structure of each was as of two wheels cutting 
through each other. And when they moved, each could move in the direction of any of its 
four quarters; they did not veer when they moved. Their rims were tall and frightening, for 
the rims of all four were covered all over with eyes. And when the creatures moved for- 
ward, the wheels moved at their sides; and when the creatures were borne above the earth, 
the wheels were borne too. Wherever the spirit impelled them to go, they went— wherever 
the spirit impelled them — and the wheels were borne alongside them; for the spirit of the 
creatures was in the wheels. When those moved, these moved; and when those stood still, 
these stood still; and when those were borne above the earth, the wheels were borne along- 
side them — for the spirit of the creatures was in the wheels. 



THE DIVINE CHARIOT 183 


Above the heads of the creatures was a form: an expanse, with an awe-inspiring gleam 
as of crystal, was spread out above their heads. Under the expanse, each had one pair of 
wings extended toward those of the others; and each had another pair covering its body. 
When they moved, I could hear the sound of their wings like the sound of mighty waters, 
like the sound of Shaddai, a tumult like the din of an army. When they stood still, they 
would let their wings droop. From above the expanse over their heads came a sound. 
When they stood still, they would let their wings droop. 

Above the expanse over their heads was the semblance of a throne, in appearance like 
sapphire; and on top, upon this semblance of a throne, there was the semblance of a 
human form. From what appeared as his loins up, I saw a gleam as of amber — what 
looked like a fire encased in a frame; and from what appeared as his loins down, I saw 
what looked like fire. There was a radiance all about him. Like the appearance of the bow 
that shines in the clouds on a day of rain, such was the appearance of the surrounding 
radiance. That was the appearance of the semblance of the Presence of the Lord. When I 
beheld it, I flung myself down on my face. And I heard the voice of someone speaking. 

Ezekiel's vision, which opens the Book of Ezekiel, is intended to be understood as 
a sign that God is about to withdraw his protection of the Temple and of Jerusalem. It 
is hard to understate the importance of this strange vision of the Divine Chariot 
(Merkavah). The description of the chariot became the basis for an entire branch of 
Jewish mysticism, what is known as Ma'aseh Merkavah, or Mysteries of the Chariot. 

(The other branch is Ma'aseh Bereshit, Mysteries of the Creation.) In the Mishnah, strict 
limitations are placed on the study of these two mystical branches: " Ma'aseh Bereshit 
may not be expounded in the presence of two, nor Ma'aseh Merkavah in the presence 
of one, unless he is wise and understanding" (Mishnah Hag . 2.1). It is clear that the 
rabbis didn't want those who were untutored in mystical principles to delve too deeply 
into these esoteric studies. For an example of how careful the rabbis were in discuss- 
ing Ma'aseh Merkavah , see the next entry, "Mysteries of the Chariot." 

Ezekiel's vision is one of the most difficult portions in the Bible, yet it is also re- 
garded as a detailed revelation of divine secrets. Those who sought to expound it 
believed that it revealed the secrets of the angelic realms, of God's throne, and even of 
God Himself. The Divine Chariot Ezekiel sees is also God's Throne of Glory. Some- 
how God's Throne and Chariot are fused into one, traveling to earth yet remaining in 
its place in heaven. 

This vision inspired subsequent literary descriptions of heavenly journeys, and 
this genre of Jewish mystical texts is known as Hekhalot texts, and includes such im- 
portant works as Hekhalot Rabhati and 3 Enoch. Most of these texts involve the ascent 
of either Rabbi Ishmael or Rabbi Akiba. David J. Halperin's The Faces of the Chariot is 
the most extensive study of the literature of Ma'aseh Merkavah.

216. MYSTERIES OF THE CHARIOT 

Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai and his student. Rabbi Eleazar ben Arakh, once rode through 
a field on their donkeys. And Rabbi Eleazar said: "Please, rabbi, teach me something 
about the Mysteries of the Chariot." 

"Surely you know that such mysteries may not be revealed to a single student, unless 
he is able to comprehend them on his own," said Rabbi Yohanan. "Therefore you may 
begin the discussion, and I will decide whether to speak of such secrets." 



184 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


At that moment Rabbi Eleazar dismounted from his donkey, wrapped himself in his 
prayer shawl, and sat down beneath an olive tree. "Why did you dismount?" asked Rabbi 
Yohanan, surprised. Rabbi Eleazar replied: "When we discuss Ma’aseh Merkavah, the 
Mysteries of the Chariot, the Shekhinah descends to listen, accompanied by many angels. 
Should I, then, be seated upon a donkey?" 

Rabbi Eleazar then began to discourse upon these very mysteries, and as he spoke a circle 
of fire descended from heaven to surround that field, and a song of praise rose up from the 
trees. And in the center of that circle an angel appeared, who stood before them and said: 
"Indeed, these are the very same Mysteries of the Chariot that are spoken of behind the 
Pargod." Then the angel disappeared, and they heard nothing more than the wind. 

At that moment Rabbi Yohanan turned to his student and kissed him on the forehead. 
"How blessed is God to have a son like Abraham, and how blessed is Abraham to have a 
son such as you. Rabbi Eleazar." 

Rabbi Yehoshua learned of this incident from Rabbi Yossi ha-Kohen while they were 
also traveling along a road. They too agreed to stop and discuss the Mysteries of the 
Chariot. All at once the skies became covered with clouds and a splendid rainbow ap- 
peared. And the rabbis saw that clusters of angels had gathered around to listen, like 
guests at a wedding who rejoice with the bride and groom. 

Later Rabbi Yossi told Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai what had happened. And Rabbi 
Yohanan replied: "Fortunate are we to have been so blessed. And now I know why I 
dreamed last night that you and I were sitting together on Mount Sinai when we heard a 
heavenly voice telling us to rise, for magnificent palaces and golden beds awaited us in 
Paradise, where we were to join the souls that sit before the Divine Presence." 

There are two primary categories of early kabbalistic contemplation: those linked 
to Ma'aseh Bereshit or The Work of Creation, and those linked to Ma'aseh Merkavah, or 
The Work of the Chariot. The former focuses on the mystical meaning of Creation as 
described in Genesis, and the latter on the vision of Ezekiel. Here the discussion of 
Ezekiel's vision and its mystical implications invokes yet another vision, shared by 
two rabbis, of angels dancing in a field. In many ways this talmudic tale defines the 
essential kabbalistic experience, presenting it in a positive and powerful fashion, and 
making it clear that Jewish mysticism is not merely a text-oriented study, but involves 
actual mystical experiences. Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai was one of the great talmudic 
sages, but here the sage accompanying him is the one who invokes the mystical vi- 
sion. This tale serves as a primary model for many tales found in the Zohar, where 
two or more rabbis discover that the lowly Jew who is traveling with them is actually 
a hidden saint, who reveals great kabbalistic mysteries to them, or invokes a mystical 
vision.

217. THE SEVEN HEAVENS 

There are seven heavens. The first serves to renew the work of Creation every day. The 
second is that in which the sun and moon and stars and constellations are set. In the third 
millstones grind manna for the righteous. In the fourth is the heavenly Jerusalem, where 
the Temple and altar are built. There Michael, Israel's guardian angel, makes offerings. In 
the fifth heaven there are companies of the ministering angels who are silent by day and 
utter divine songs at night. 



THE SEVEN HEAVENS 185 


In the sixth heaven are stored the treasuries of snow and hail, and the lofts of dews 
and raindrops, the chambers of whirlwind and storm, the cave of vapor and the doors of 
fire. The seventh is the highest heaven, Aravot, where are found the treasuries of peace 
and blessing, the souls of the righteous and the souls not yet created, as well as the dew 
with which God will revive the dead. So too are there many kinds of angels, the Ofanim 
and the Seraphim and the holy living creatures and the ministering angels. And the Throne 
of God, high and exalted, dwells over them all. 

In Jewish lore, the basic concepts of heaven and hell are elaborated, describing 
seven levels of heaven and seven levels of hell. In fact, there are also seven levels of 
the earth. The seven heavens are identified as Vilon (Curtain), Raki'a (Firmament), 
Shehakim (Clouds), Zebul (Lofty Dwelling), Ma'on (Dwelling), Makhon (Residence) and 
Aravot (Highest Heaven). This myth of the seven heavens attributes a specific func- 
tion to each one. In more general terms, the souls of the righteous are said to ascend 
from the lower heavens to the higher ones as they become worthy of them. The higher 
the soul ascends, the closer it comes to God and to the palaces of the patriarchs and 
sages that are found in the highest heavens. According to Rabbi Meir ibn Gabbai in 
Avodat ha-Kodesh 27, the soul does not ascend to the highest heavens on the first at- 
tempt. Accustomed to living in the darkness of the body, it cannot endure the bril- 
liance of the divine light. Therefore the soul stays in the lower Gan Eden until it gets 
used to this light, and then it ascends on high.

218. THE EIGHTH HEAVEN 

There are not only seven heavens, but there is even an eighth heaven. It is found above 
the heads of the living creatures, as it is said. Above the heads of the creatures was a form: an 
expanse , with an awe-inspiring gleam as of crystal, was spread out above their heads (Ezek. 1:22). 
This is the place where the most hidden mysteries are to be found. But it is not permitted 
to reveal any more about them, as it said. The hidden things are for God , the revealed things 
are for our children (Deut. 29:28). 

While Jewish lore often speaks of seven heavens, and these are described in detail 
in various rabbinic texts and in the Hekhalot texts that recount heavenly journeys, little 
is said about an eighth heaven. But in B. Hagigah 13a, Rabbi Aha ben Jacob mentions 
the eighth heaven, which is described as being above the hayot or living creatures that 
hold up God's throne. This is the ultimate place of mysteries, and such mysteries 
could not be revealed: "The things that are the mystery of the world should be kept 
secret" (B. Hag. 13a). The existence of such an eighth heaven may be inferred since the 
living creatures in the seventh heaven hold up the Throne of Glory, and Ezekiel 1:13- 
14 describes a vast expanse that is understood to be another firmament ( raki'a ) above 
their heads. 

This eighth heaven is an essential part of Gnostic speculation, where it is described 
as a power beyond the reach of the seven heavens. See Poimandres 26.

186 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


219. THE PARGOD 

There is an exceedingly wonderful curtain in Paradise, spread before God, which sepa- 
rates God from the angels. That curtain is entirely covered with supernal illuminations, 
forming the letters of the complete Name of God. All forms and representations in this 
world are depicted there, just the way they are in the world below. This curtain is known 
as the Pargod. Only God's Bride and the angel Metatron, Prince of the Presence, are per- 
mitted on God's side of the curtain. The deeds of all the generations of the world, past 
and present, are printed there, until the last generation. 

When Rabbi Ishmael ascended on high, Metatron took him to the Pargod. There 
Metatron pointed out all the generations that would follow, like a father teaching his son 
the letters of the Torah. And there Rabbi Ishmael witnessed all the generations from the 
time of Adam until the days of the Messiah, and all of their deeds were recounted there. 
Not only did he witness these deeds with his own eyes, but he experienced them as if 
they were taking place. \ 

After witnessing all of the generations printed on that heavenly curtain. Rabbi Ishmael 
opened his mouth, saying. How many are the things You have made, O Lord; the earth is full of 
Your creations (Ps. 104:24). 

3 Enoch records Rabbi Ishmael's ascent into heaven, led by the angel Metatron, the 
Prince of the Presence. As part of his tour of heaven, Metatron takes him to the Pargod, 
the curtain that separates God from the angels. This curtain is the heavenly counter- 
part of the curtain that separated the Holy of Holies in the earthly Tabernacle and 
Temple. (See Exodus 26:31 and 2 Chronicles 3:14.) 

This myth demonstrates that God, and the mysteries of God, are hidden even from 
the angels, except for Metatron. Just as humans are not supposed to view God face to 
face, neither are the angels. There are occasional exceptions to this rule, whereby, for 
example, Moses ascends to the Throne of Glory and speaks to God face to face (B. 

Men. 29b and B. Shab. 88b-89a). The Pargod is also known as Pargod ha-Makom — the 
Curtain of the Place of God. The identification of Makom as the place of God comes 
from the dream of Jacob, when he said. This is none other than the abode of God, and that 
is the gateway to heaven (Gen. 28:17) The term Makom is also a designation for God, and 
is often translated as "God Almighty." 

In this myth, the Pargod is the curtain that God is hidden behind, which has printed 
on it the history of all generations from the first to the last. Thus the whole course of 
human history has already been determined in the heavenly realm and has been pre- 
ordained by God. This motif of God's foreknowledge of all generations is also found 
in The Book of Raziel, p. 253 and in the myths about the pre-existence of the Torah. See 
"Seven Things Created Before the Creation," p. 74. 

Shloyshe Sheorim describes a heavenly curtain that separates the men from the women 
in Paradise. See "Women in Paradise," p. 190.

220. THE MAP OF TIME AND SPACE 

There is a king who possesses a map of all the worlds. It is shaped like a hand, with five 
fingers and lines, like a real hand. Everything that has existed or will ever exist until the 
end of time is illustrated on this hand. The lines and wrinkles of the hand illustrate the 



THE SEVEN HEAVENS 187 


structure of all the worlds, just like a map. Every nation and city is illustrated there, along 
with all the rivers, bridges, and mountains. All the people who live in those nations and 
everything they experience are illustrated on that hand, even the roads from one nation 
to another. So too are the pathways from earth to heaven delineated, as well as the path- 
ways between one world and the next. Elijah ascended to heaven on one pathway, while 
Moses went to heaven on another, and Enoch went to heaven on yet another path, and all 
of these pathways are also illustrated there. Thus everything is illustrated on that hand: 
what was, what is, and what will be. 

This is an intriguing allegory by Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav in which a king — who 
is surely God — possesses an object in the shape of a map that portrays everything that 
has existed or will exist. This map of time and space likely represents the Pargod, the 
mythical curtain in Paradise that separates God from the angels. One side of this cur- 
tain is said to portray all of the past and future, exactly as does this map. See " The 
Pargod ," p. 186.

221. THE PLACE OF THE STARS 

The stars in the firmament have fiery bodies, like angels, and they are gathered in the 
Place of the Stars. When Metatron, Prince of the Presence, took Rabbi Ishmael on a tour of 
heaven, he showed him that place. As Rabbi Ishmael walked by his side, hand in hand, 
Metatron pointed out the stars glowing like fiery sparks clustered around the Merkavah, 
the very Throne and Chariot of God Almighty. 

At that moment Metatron clapped his hands, and chased the stars away from there. 
They flew off with flaming wings, and fled from the four sides of God's Throne, and as 
the stars flew by, Metatron told Rabbi Ishmael the name of every single one of them, as it 
is said. He reckoned the number of the stars ; to each He gave its name (Ps. 147:4). For God had 
given every one of them a name. 

All the stars in the firmament are counted by the angel Rahatiel, for they are the handi- 
work of God. They come forth to be counted in order to praise God with songs and 
hymns, as it is said. The heavens declare the glory of God (Ps. 19:1). 

But in the time to come God will create them anew, and they will open their mouths 
and utter a song to the Lord. 

In this celestial myth, the stars are regarded as animate beings, much like angels. 
Above all they are drawn to surround God's Throne, the Merkavah , which is also por- 
trayed as a chariot. In this view, the stars, like the angels, exist primarily to praise 
God, and they are fully under the control of heaven, as indicated here by the ease with 
which Metatron claps his hand and they depart. 3 Enoch is a treasure-trove of infor- 
mation about the fantastic geography of heaven. In later Jewish texts, such as those of 
Maimonides, this mythic view of the stars would be replaced by a speculative astro- 
logical view.

222. THE RAINBOW OF THE SHEKHINAH 

The heavenly counterpart of the rainbow seen in the clouds is the rainbow of the Shekhinah , 
as it is said, I have set My bow in the clouds (Gen. 9:13). The arches of this rainbow are set 



188 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


above Aravot, the highest heaven, and clouds of the rainbow surround the Throne of 
Glory. Above the arches of the rainbow are the wheels of the Merkavah. The rainbow itself 
rests upon the shoulders of the angel Kerubiel, the Prince of the Cherubim. This angel 
has a mouth that is like a lamp of fire, a tongue of consuming fire, eyebrows like light- 
ning, and eyes like sparks of brilliance. On his head there is a crown of holiness on which 
God's Name is engraved. Between his shoulders rests the rainbow of the Shekhinah, and 
the splendor of the Shekhinah is on his face. 

Here the rainbow of the Shekhinah is described as a heavenly counterpart of the 
earthly rainbow. Its sources can be found in Genesis 9:13 and in Ezekiel 1:28: Like the 
appearance of the bow which shines in the clouds on a day of rain, such was the appearance of 
the surrounding radiance. Ezekiel's vision also links the rainbow with the vision of the 
Merkavah: Above the expanse over their heads was the semblance of a throne (Ezek. 1:26). 

Building on the vision of Ezekiel, this divine rainbow is described as one of the heav- 
enly splendors, in terms that link it to other mythic elements in the divine constellation. 

These include the Throne of Glory and the wheels of the Merkavah, the Divine Chariot. 

(Note that in Ezekiel's visions, there is some kind of combination of the identity of the 
Throne of Glory and the Divine Chariot.) These are known as "the wheels of the Ophanim." 
Imposed on all this is a gigantic angel, Kerubiel, Prince of the Cherubim, with the rain- 
bow of the Shekhinah resting between his shoulders. 

The angel Kerubiel is described in terms almost identical to Metatron, the fiery 
angel who is the focus of 3 Enoch. Both angels seem to represent the sun, which ex- 
plains the strange image of the rainbow resting on the angel's shoulders, since the 
rainbow is seen when the rain has stopped and the sun has reemerged.

223. THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES 

Heaven is always making music, with perfect harmony, created in accordance with its 
celestial motions, as it is said. The heavens declare the glory of God (Ps. 19:2). Some say the 
source of this music is an orchestra of angels. Others say it is the rhythm and melody of 
the planets and stars as they circle the heavens. 

If, by chance, this music should reach our ears, irrepressible cravings would emerge, 
frenzied longings, and insane passions. These longings would be so great, we would no 
longer take nourishment from food and drink in the manner of mortals, but as beings 
destined for immortality. 

This happened to Moses when he ascended Mount Sinai. There, for forty days and 
nights, he touched neither bread nor water. Soon the strains of this heavenly music reached 
his ears, along with the words of the Torah as God recited them. It is said that for the rest 
of his life Moses heard this unearthly music, just as the light that shone from his face after 
Sinai always remained with him. 

Here Philo draws on the Pythagorean concept of the music of the spheres. Philo's 
immediate source was probably an ancient midrash, which is found in Sefer Hadar 
Zekenim Toratam shel Rishonim. (See Ginzberg, Legends, 5:36, note 102.) However, its 
inclusion in his writings is consistent with his interest in Greek concepts. In the Greek 
view, music was believed to reflect divine harmony. The rhythm and melody of the 
heavenly bodies thus delineate the music of the spheres as well as reflect the moral 
order of the universe. The closest Jewish myth is that of the song of praise of the 
heavenly bodies, which grows out of Psalm 19:2: The heavens declare the glory ofYahweh. 

The progress of the sun in its circuit was said to produce a hymn of praise to God. See 
also Zohar 1:2316. 



THE SEVEN HEAVENS 189 


Linking the Greek concept of the music of the spheres with Moses creates a Jewish 
myth. Philo suggests that this music can only be heard by a disembodied soul, since it 
would otherwise drive mortals mad with passion. Since Moses did without food or 
drink while on Mount Sinai, he achieved this spiritual state, and thus was able to hear 
this heavenly music.

224. THE TREASURY OF MERITS 

There is a Treasury of Merits hidden in heaven. In that treasury there are rooms in which 
ledgers are kept that show the sorrows recorded there, all differing from one another. 
Nearby there are rooms with even greater hardships to be found — those destined to die 
by the sword, those destined to die by famine, those destined for captivity, those des- 
tined for disgrace. And every day there are added hardships more severe than these, but 
whenever Israel blesses God's Name, these hardships are not permitted to leave the room. 

So too are there treasuries of comfort, where ministering angels sit and weave gar- 
ments of salvation, making crowns of life and fixing precious stones and pearls to them. 
These, too, are intended for the Israelites. One crown has the sun and moon and twelve 
constellations fastened to it. This crown is intended for David, King of Israel. 

When Moses was in heaven, God showed him all the treasuries that will be given to 
the righteous in the World to Come. Some of those treasuries were for those who obeyed 
God's commandments, others for those who took care of orphans. Among them Moses 
saw a very great treasury. He asked, "And to whom will this treasury be given?" God 
answered, "That is the Treasury of Gifts. I will give it to whomever I want." 

There are many myths about heavenly treasuries. The Treasury of Merits contains 
ledgers that keep track of sorrows and hardships. This reinforces the idea that God 
observes all that takes place in a person's life and credits them for their suffering and 
hardships. See "The Books of Life and Death," p. 289. So too are there treasuries of 
comfort, intended for the righteous in the World to Come. Moses encounters a mys- 
terious, large treasury, which God identifies as the Treasury of Gifts, and God refuses 
to explain how He will determine who will receive those gifts. Rabbi Nachman of 
Bratslav identifies these free gifts as the life force. He states that this gift can only be 
received in idle moments. Therefore, even holy men need these idle moments to re- 
ceive this life-force, which they then pass on to those who really need it. Thus for 
Rabbi Nachman times of leisure are just as sacred as times of prayer or study. In this 
he follows the pattern of his great-grandfather the Ba'al Shem Tov, who often took 
long walks in the forest. See "The Treasury of Souls," p. 166.

225. THE WINGS OF HEAVEN 

The wings of heaven are tied to the wings of the land, and the wings of the land are tied 
to the wings of heaven, and sealed with God's name. 

This is an imaginative restatement of the primary kabbalistic principle that "as 
above, so below; as below, so above."

226. THE PALACES OF HEAVEN 

The mysteries of the Torah are not only contemplated in this world, but also in the World 
to Come, for genuine scholars do not cease their studies when they die. The souls of the 
righteous, along with the angels, continue to study Torah in the heavenly Garden of 
Eden. There each of the patriarchs and matriarchs and great sages has his or her own 
palace, where they teach myriads of students beneath tranquil canopies. It is possible to 
sit in the classroom of Maimonides, as well as the classroom of Rashi, the great commen- 
tator. Those who ascend even higher in heaven arrive at the palace of Moses, where the 
Torah is taught from the very lips of Moses. And those who ascend to the very highest 
heaven reach the palace of Abraham. Abraham's mastery of the Torah is said to be so 
great that those who hear him weep tears of joy. 

One of the primary traditional rewards for the righteous souls who ascended to 
Paradise was the opportunity to study Torah with the greatest sages of all time, in- 
cluding the patriarchs and great talmudic masters. Some texts even describe the Mes- 
siah teaching Torah in his heavenly palace, and there are even texts in which God 
Himself teaches Torah to the souls of the righteous. See "The Ba'al Shem Tov Ascends 
on High," p. 209, and "God Teaches Torah in the World to Come," p. 271. See also 
"The Ocean of Tears," a folktale about a journey to the palaces of heaven, in Reimagining 
the Bible, pp. 157-159.

227. WOMEN IN PARADISE 

There are six palaces in Paradise where the souls of the righteous women make their 
home. Each of these righteous women has a palace of her own. In each chamber there are 
beautiful canopies, with angels set over them, and every day they are crowned with the 
radiance of the Shekhinah. 

The first palace is ruled by Bitiah, Pharaoh's daughter, who raised Moses as if he were 
her own son. She teaches the commandments of the Torah to the many thousands of 
myriads of pious women who are with her, and she serves as their queen. These women 
still maintain their human form, and they are clothed in garments of light, and there is 
great joy among them. Three times a day Bitiah goes to a place where there is a curtain, 
and bows before the image of Moses, saying, "Fortunate am I for drawing such a light 
out of the water." 

The next palace is that of Serah bat Asher, who rules over thousands of myriads of 
righteous women. They busy themselves with praises of the Lord, and contemplate the 
commandments of the Torah. Three times a day Serah goes to a curtain and bows before 
the image of Joseph, saying, "Happy was the day on which I gave the good news about 
Joseph to my grandfather, Jacob." 

The other palaces are presided over by Yocheved, the mother of Moses, Miriam the 
prophetess, the sister of Moses, and Deborah the prophetess. All day long the women are 
by themselves, as are the men, for there is a curtain spread out in Paradise that separates 
them. But every night they come together at midnight, for that is the hour of copulation. 
Then they cleave soul to soul and light to light, and the fruit of this union are the souls of 
those who become converts to Judaism. 



THE LANDMARKS OF HEAVEN 191 


Hidden deep within these six palaces are the four hidden palaces of the matriarchs, 
Sarah, Rebecca, Leah, and Rachel. No one can imagine what joy and purity are found there, 
for no one has seen these palaces, or is permitted to reveal anything about them. 

The righteous women in these heavenly palaces are those who never had to suffer 
the pains of Gehenna. Their souls went directly to Paradise at the time of their deaths. 

Those whose sins require that they first be purified in Gehenna, Jewish hell, are not 
permitted in these palaces. 

Although Bitiah, the daughter of Pharaoh, was not Jewish, she still has been in- 
ducted into the Jewish pantheon of righteous women in Paradise. Indeed, she rules 
over the first of six palaces devoted to the souls of righteous women. Leviticus Kabbah 
1:3 explains that her name means "daughter of God" (Bitiah). According to the Zohar, 
the other women who rule over these heavenly palaces are Yocheved, Miriam, Deborah, 
and the four matriarchs. The last have hidden palaces within the six heavenly palaces 
of the righteous women. Seder Gan Eden adds Hulda the prophetess and Abigail to the 
list of righteous women.

Asher," p. 377.

228. THE TENT OF THE SUN 

It is a journey of five hundred years between one firmament to another, and the sun makes 
this journey covered with a tent, as it is said. He placed in them a tent for the sun (Ps. 19:5). 

The sun rises in the east, riding forth in a chariot crowned as a bridegroom. Three 
letters of God's Name are written upon the heart of the sun, and angels lead it. His fiery 
face looks down upon the earth in the summer, but in winter the face of the sun turns icy, 
and were it not for fire, nothing would be able to endure. Thus the sun runs his course 
across the heavens, and as he sets in the west, the sun bows down before God, saying: 
"Master of the universe, I have fulfilled all Your commands." 

At the End of Days God will roll open the upper firmament, and then God will remove 
the tent from the sun. On that day God will make a tent for the righteous and hide them 
in it from the searing heat of the Day of Judgment. 

Just as there are sun myths in other traditions, so too are there sun myths in Juda- 
ism. Here the sun is personified and rides in a chariot led by angels, much as Apollo 
guides the chariot of the rising sun. There are some beautiful details, such as three 
letters of God's Name written on the heart of the sun. The tent of the sun is elsewhere 
described as a sheath, as in Midrash Tanhuma, where it is said that "The sun is kept 
within its sheath, but during the Tammuz solstice, it emerges from its sheath to ripen 
fruits" (Midrash Tanhuma , Ve-Atah Tetzaveh 6). The purpose of this tent/sheath is to 
prevent the sun from incinerating the world: "The orb of the sun is kept within a 
sheath, in front of which there is a pool of water. When the sun comes out, God tem- 
pers its strength in the water, so that as it goes forth it will not incinerate the world" 
(Genesis Kabbah 6:6). The image of the sun's chariot derives from 2 Kings 23:11: the 
chariots of the sun. The rolling open of the upper firmament derives from the passage. 



192 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


The heavens shall be rolled up like a scroll (Isa. 34:4). The tent of the sun is described (Y. 
A.Z. 3) as a pool of water set in front of the sun. When the sun comes forth, God 
diminishes the sun's power by immersing it in the water, so that it will not go out and 
consume the world. 

The key images of this myth, including that of the tent of the sun and of the sun as 
a bridegroom grow out of Psalms 19:5-6: He placed them in a tent for the sun, who is like a 
groom coming forth from his chamber, like a hero , eager to run his course . 

Note that the descriptions of the angel Metatron portray him in terms that seem 
identical to the sun, suggesting that the myth of Metatron may well be a remnant of a 
sun myth in Judaism. See "The Metamorphosis and Enthronement of Enoch," p. 156.

229. THE TENT OF HEAVEN 

Heaven is like a stretched-out tent, whose comers are low and whose center is high. The 
children of Adam sit under that tent and make their home there. The hooks of heaven are 
fastened to the waters of the ocean, and the edges of heaven are spread over the waters. 

This myth of the heavens forming a tent is based on the verse Who spread out the 
skies like gauze, stretched them out like a tent to dwell in (Isa. 40:22). Of course, the image 
of the tent is a resonant one in Judaism, where the 40 years the Israelites spent wan- 
dering in the desert, sleeping in tents, serve as an archetype of Jewish experience. The 
simple, primitive notion that the sky is a big tent also emphasizes the role of God in 
ruling over the entire world. It also suggests the idea that heaven and earth together 
form God's palace, as stated in Isaiah 66:1, " The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My 
footstool ." A similar notion is expressed in Habakkuk 3:3, His majesty fills the skies , His 
splendor fills the earth.

230. THE CRYSTAL PALACE 

Led by the angel Michael, Enoch ascended on high, until they reached the heaven of 
heavens. There he saw a structure built of crystals, and between those crystals were tongues 
of living fire. Rivers full of living fire encircled that structure, and countless angels went 
in and out of that crystal palace, including Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. With them was 
the Ancient of Days. His head was white and pure like wool, as it is said. And the hair of 
His head was like pure wool (Dan. 7:9). 

Here Enoch ascends to the highest heaven, Aravot, and sees God, here identified as 
the Ancient of Days (alternately translated as "Antecedent of Time" or "Head of Days"), 
accompanied by the angels, entering a crystal structure that appears to be some kind of 
heavenly palace. We know that this figure is God because of the description of His hair, 
which is white and like pure wool. This is an often-echoed description of God from 
Daniel 7:9: And the hair of His head was like pure wool. This scene of God accompanied by 
the angels in heaven is reminiscent of God walking in the Garden of Eden (Gen. 3:8).

231. THE CELESTIAL ACADEMY 

Not a day passes in which God does not teach a new law in the heavenly academy. Just as the 
souls of the holy sages each teach in their own heavenly palace, so God teaches in the Celes- 
tial Academy. It is said that God assigns the righteous a closer place to the divine glory than 
He does for the angels. And the angels are always asking them, "What has God taught you?" 

There are certain matters that must be left undecided until God comes and teaches the 
truth, for one day God will settle all unresolved questions of the Law. But God is not the 
only teacher in the Celestial Academy. Elijah and the Messiah also teach there. And until 
God delivers a final decision, it is Elijah's task to settle all doubts on ritual and judicial 
matters. So too does the Messiah elucidate the words of the Torah, and point out where 
the Law has been misconstrued. 

After God has spoken, the sages of the Celestial Academy discuss God's rulings, and 
sometimes debate them. Then who will settle the matter? On one occasion they decided 
that it should be Rabbah bar Nachmani, who was alive on earth at that time, for he was 
an expert on these laws. A messenger was sent for him, but the Angel of Death could not 
approach him, because he did not interrupt his studies for even a moment. Meanwhile, a 
wind blew that rustled the bushes, and he imagined it to be a troop of soldiers. "Let me 
die," he cried out, "rather than be delivered into their hands." As his soul took leave of this 
world, a heavenly voice called out, "Happy are you, O Rabbah bar Nachmani, whose soul 
has departed in purity." At that time a letter fell from the sky to Pumbedita, upon which 
was written, "Rabbah bar Nachmani has been called up to the Celestial Academy." 

Another visit to the Celestial Academy took place after the death of Rabbi Shimon bar 
Yohai. Rabbi Hiyya went to visit his grave and said: "Dust, be not proud, for Rabbi Shimon, 
the pillar of the world, will never waste away in you." And Rabbi Hiyya wept, and when 
he left there he was still weeping. 

That is when Rabbi Hiyya began to fast so that he might be permitted to see Rabbi 
Shimon's place in Paradise. After fasting for forty days, he dreamed that an angel came 
and told him he could not see Rabbi Shimon. Then Rabbi Hiyya continued to fast and 
weep for another forty days. And on the eightieth day Rabbi Hiyya dreamed that he saw 
Rabbi Shimon in Paradise. He was teaching while thousands listened, sages and angels 
alike. Then, in the dream. Rabbi Shimon said: "Let Rabbi Hiyya enter here, to see what 
awaits him in the World to Come." 

That is when Rabbi Hiyya awoke, and when he opened his eyes, he saw a winged 
angel standing beside the bed, and he understood that it had been sent to bring him to 
Paradise. Then Rabbi Hiyya mounted the angel, and they ascended at once to the Celes- 
tial Academy. There Rabbi Hiyya saw Rabbi Shimon standing exactly as he had seen him 
in his dream, discussing the same point of the Law. 

All at once there was a heavenly voice saying, "Make way for King Messiah, who is com- 
ing to Rabbi Shimon's academy." And all of the righteous stood and made a path for the 
Messiah. Just then the Messiah saw Rabbi Hiyya and said: "Who brought this mortal here?" 
Rabbi Shimon replied: "This is Rabbi Hiyya, who is the light of the lamp of the Torah." And 
the Messiah said: "Then let him be gathered here." "No," said Rabbi Shimon, "Let him be 
given more time." When the Messiah heard the words of Rabbi Shimon, he nodded in assent, 
and at that moment the winged angel brought Rabbi Hiyya back to this world. And an in- 
stant later he found himself alone in his room, and he could not stop shaking. 

Just as there are earthly academies where the Torah is studied and the laws are 
debated, so is there said to be a Celestial Academy, where God creates and teaches 
new laws every day. This notion is an interesting one, in that it suggests the ever- 
expanding nature of the Torah. The fact that it is God who is doing the teaching gives 



194 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


the seal of approval to this open-ended approach to Torah. This rabbinic myth can be 
seen to serve as a self-justification, arguing the correctness of this approach. 

The proof that God teaches on high is found in the verse Hear attentively the sound of 
His voice , and the meditation that comes forth from His mouth (Job 37:2). Genesis Rabhah 
49:2 explains that "meditation" refers to the Torah, as in the verse But you shall medi- 
tate therein day and night (Josh. 1:8). According to Genesis Rabbah, these are the laws of 
the Torah that even Abraham was said to know. 

Since the Torah was not given until the time of Moses, rabbis were frustrated that 
the earlier patriarchs did not know the Torah. This was so difficult to accept that there 
are various legends about how they received the Torah anyway, such as the chain of 
legends about the Book of Raziel, which is a clear mask for the Torah. But there is 
another notion, that there were certain laws of the Torah that Abraham knew, since, 
for example, he followed the laws of circumcision. How did Abraham learn these 
laws? This myth from Genesis Rabbah suggests that he somehow learned them directly 
from God, as these are the same laws that God teaches in heaven. In some fashion, 
which is not described, Abraham was privy to these teachings. 

Rabbah bar Nachmani receives an invitation from heaven to resolve a debate in the 
Celestial Academy. The Angel of Death is sent as a messenger to bring him, but is 
unable to do so because he never stops studying the Torah. This reflects the tradition 
that the Angel of Death cannot take a man while he is studying Torah. A similar story 
is told about King David and the Angel of Death, in which the angel had to create a 
diversion to lure David away from his studies, so that he could take his soul. 

Unlike Rabbah bar Nachmani, Rabbi Hiyya, disciple of Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai, is 
determined to go to the Celestial Academy even though he does not have an invita- 
tion. Rabbi Hiyya fasts to achieve something that is not permitted to the living— to 
see Shimon bar Yohai's place in Paradise. This tale confirms the taboo of a human 
entering into Paradise, which finds its model in the tale of the ascent of Moses into 
heaven to receive the Torah. The angels sought to cast him out of Paradise, for none of 
the living are permitted there (B. Shab. 88b). See "The Ascent of Moses," p. 261. For 
another account of a journey into Paradise by one of the living, see "Rabbi Joshua ben 
Levi and the Angel of Death," p. 207. 

The account of Rabbi Hiyya's efforts to travel to the Celestial Academy, from the 
Zohar , may have been inspired by a talmudic myth concerning Rabbi Hiyya found in 
B. Bava hAetzia 85b. Here one rabbi sees another whose eyes appeared as though they 
had been burnt. He asks him what has happened, and the rabbi explains that he asked 
Elijah to show him the souls of departed rabbis as they ascend to the Celestial Acad- 
emy. Elijah agreed that he could look upon all except for the carriage of Rabbi Hiyya. 
How would he recognize Rabbi Hiyya's carriage? All would be accompanied by an- 
gels when they ascend except Rabbi Hiyya's, which ascends on its own. But the rabbi 
disobeyed and did gaze upon Rabbi Hiyya's carriage, and at that instant two fiery 
streams came forth, which blinded him. The next day this rabbi prostrated himself on 
the grave of Rabbi Hiyya, and his sight was healed.

232. WHERE HEAVEN AND EARTH MEET 

In his desert travels, Rabbah bar Bar Hannah met a Bedouin, who offered to show him 
where heaven and earth meet. They went there, and found the Wheel of Heaven, which 
contained many windows. Rabbah took his bread basket and placed it in one of the win- 
dows of heaven. Then he prayed the afternoon prayer. 



THE MINISTERIN6 AN6ELS 195 


When he finished praying, Rabbah could not find his basket. He asked the Bedouin if 
there were thieves in that place. The Bedouin explained that the Wheel of Heaven turned 
when the sun set. He told Rabbah to wait until the next day and he would find his basket. 
And he did. 

This is one of the miraculous tales attributed to Rabbah bar Bar Hannah, who is the 
Sinbad of rabbinic literature. A series of tall tales attributed to him is found in tractate 
Bava Batra of the Talmud. Here a mysterious Bedouin (who might be Elijah in dis- 
guise) shows him where the Wheel of Heaven can be found, at the place where heaven 
and earth kiss. Proof that the wheel does indeed revolve every twenty-four hours 
comes from the disappearance and reappearance of Rabbah's basket. 

The reference to the Wheel of Heaven offers an explanation for the cycle of the sun, 
positing a mythical place where the Wheel of Heaven comes into contact with the 
earth. That such a place would be found in rabbinic lore is significant, as it ties to- 
gether the worlds above and below.

233. THE PRIMORDIAL METATRON 

The Primordial Metatron was the first of creation, the son of the Shekhinah. The first words of 
the Torah, In the beginning God created, refer to Metatron. The Primordial Metatron assisted 
God in the creation of the world, and has assisted God ever since in ruling the worlds above 
and below. When God said to Moses, "Come up to the Lord," he meant to come up to Metatron. 

This description of a Primordial Metatron closely resembles the myths about the 
Heavenly Man and Adam Kadmon. What is unusual is that the primordial Metatron 
is described as the son of the Shekhinah. Since this myth is found in the Zohar, the 
Shekhinah refers to God's Bride, making the Primordial Metatron the child of God and 
the Shekhinah. The Christian echoes of the "son of God" are apparent, as well as the 
structure of a divine family as is found in other mythic traditions, such as the Greek or 
Canaanite. See "The Heavenly Man," p. 124 and "Adam Kadmon," p. 15. 

The identification of "the Lord" as Metatron is, surprisingly, found in the Talmud. 

For a further discussion of this, see the Introduction, p. 1. 

The notion of a Primordial Metatron contradicts the standard explanation of 
Metatron' s origin as Enoch, who was transformed into Metatron after being carried 
into heaven in a fiery chariot. It demonstrates an alternate Metatron tradition apart 
from that linked to Enoch. Of course, the original Enoch tradition dates from around 
the second century bce, and the Zohar from the thirteenth century. Thus it is possible 
that this is one of many new mythic traditions found in the Zohar.

234. THE ANGEL METATRON 

God made a throne for Metatron similar to the Throne of Glory, and spread a curtain of 
splendor over him, and on it were fixed all kinds of lights in the universe. Metatron sits 
on that throne at the entrance to the seventh heavenly palace, where he judges all the 
upper beings, the family on high, with the permission of God. So too does he offer the 



196 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


souls of the righteous in the heavenly Temple as an atonement for the Jewish people. The 
hand of God rests on the head of His servant, whose height is that of the entire universe, 
and the attending angels stand before him. 

When Surya, the Prince of the Presence, goes in to arrange and to set in order God's 
Throne of Glory and to prepare a seat for Metatron, the Mighty One of Jacob, he binds a 
thousand diadems of majesty upon the heads of each of them, and kneels and falls down 
and prostrates himself a thousand times before each one. 

Before God appointed Metatron to serve the Throne of Glory, God opened up three 
hundred thousands gates of discernment to him, and as many gates of cunning, compas- 
sion, and love, as well as the gates of humility, sustenance, mercy, and the fear of heaven. 
And God revealed the mysteries of the Torah to him and all the secrets of wisdom, and all 
the secrets of Creation. 

Then God gave Metatron a royal crown that included 49 precious stones, each as bright 
as the light of the sun. The light of these stones penetrates to the far comers of all seven 
heavens. God Himself engraved on Metatron's crown the letters with which the heavens 
and the earth and all their hosts were created. So too did God give him His cloak. His 
crown, and His name. And God made Metatron a garment with all types of light in it, 
and He dressed him in it. So too did God give Metatron the highest splendor, which is the 
light of the soul that Adam forfeited by his sin. 

And God sent forth a herald, who announced that Metatron was ruler over all the 
princes of heaven and over all the children of heaven. And every angel who had to speak 
in God's presence should speak to him instead. Indeed, there are those who say that 
Metatron is the Lord God of Israel, God of the heavens and God of the earth, God of 
Gods, God of the sea and God of the land. 

This is Metatron, Prince of the Presence. The angels who are with him encircle the 
Throne of Glory on one side and the celestial beasts are on the other side, and the Shekhinah 
is in the center of the Throne of Glory. And God called Metatron the lesser Yahweh before 
His entire heavenly family, as it is said, for "My Name is within him " (Exod. 23:23). 

Then Metatron says in a great voice, "The Throne of Glory is glistening!" Immediately, 
the angels surrounding the throne fall silent and hasten into the river of fire, and the celes- 
tial creatures turn their faces toward the earth. Then Metatron brings the fire of deafness 
and puts it in their ears, so that they do not hear the sound of God's speech and the explicit 
Name that Metatron utters at that time in seven voices, or, some say, seventy voices in all. 

In the Hekhalot texts, describing heavenly journeys, the angel Metatron is described 
in terms that are virtually equal, and sometimes superior, to those used to describe God. 

When Hekhalot Rabbati describes Metatron as "Lord God of Israel, God of heavens and 
God of the earth, God of Gods, God of the sea and God of the land," there is little doubt 
that the author regards Metatron at least as the "Lesser Yahweh," if not as God's equal. 

Just the fact that both God and Metatron are served by Surya, the Prince of the Presence 
is a clear indication of their divine status, and he is described as treating them equally, 
prostrating himself a thousand times before each one. 

According to Gershom Scholem, Metatron was a secret name for Michael. Michael is 
not only one of the archangels, but he is also the High Priest in the heavenly Temple, so 
that his role is already elevated, although not to the heights of Metatron. Metatron is more 
commonly linked to Enoch and the belief that Enoch had been transformed into Metatron.

THE MINISTERING ANCELS 197 


235. THE ANGEL SANDALPHON 

Now the angels do not have permission to sing in heaven until the children of Israel first 
raise their voices in song on earth. Only when the angels hear praises of Israel can they 
commence to sing. 

When it comes time to attend to the songs and music and praises that ascend from 
earth from the synagogues and schools, there is a certain angel, Sandalphon, who stands 
above the windows of the firmament. As the prayers of Israel are offered, all the words 
uttered ascend on high, cleaving their way through ethers and firmaments, until they 
reach Sandalphon. He stands behind the Throne of God and wreathes crowns out of 
those prayers. 

When the crowns are ready, he adjures them so that they rise of their own accord and 
come to rest on the head of God, as it is said. Blessings light upon the head of the righteous 
(Prov. 10:6). And when the crown reaches God's head, all the hosts on high shake with 
awe, and the creatures of the chariot roar like lions, and all of them cry out. Holy , holy , 
holy! The Lord of Hosts (Isa. 6:3). 

Sandalphon is one of the most prominent of the angels in fewish lore. He is said to 
be so tall that if he were standing on the earth, his head would reach into the highest 
heaven. In the myths about the ascent of Moses into heaven, Moses sees Sandalphon 
standing behind God's throne. See "The Ascent of Moses/' p. 261. But the most com- 
mon myth about Sandalphon concerns his gathering the prayers of Israel and forming 
them into crowns of prayer for God to wear on His Throne of Glory.

236. MICHAEL, THE PATRON ANGEL 

The archangel Michael is Israel's patron angel. Once Michael praised Israel for her loyalty 
to God. Overhearing this, Satan declared that he could take away the holiness entrusted to 
Israel. Through sin and strife, Satan succeeded in snatching it away, and the Temple was 
destroyed and the people sent into exile. The angel Michael led them into exile, but then he 
abandoned them. But the day will come when it will be proved that Israel did not inten- 
tionally surrender her trust, and then she will regain the favor of her patron angel. 

This myth grows out of the tradition that each nation has its own guardian angel, 
and Michael is the guardian angel of Israel. Here Israel loses Michael's trust through 
sin and strife, triggered by Satan, and the only hope for Israel is to regain Michael's 
trust. This, it appears, would be the equivalent of the coming of the Messiah. Other 
myths describe God as Israel's guardian, while all other nations have angels. See "The 
Seventy Nations and the Land of Israel," p. 408.

237. ELIJAH THE ANGEL 

Elijah was translated, body and soul, from this world to the world above, as it is said, A 
fiery chariot with fiery horses suddenly appeared . . . and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind 
(2 Kings 2:11). Nor did he ever taste death, but he was transformed into an angel. At that 



198 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


time Elijah received a celestial body, which made it possible for him to ascend to heaven. 
But when he descends to earth on a mission, he resumes wearing his terrestrial body. 

The angel Elijah has giant wings, and with four strokes of his wings he can travel from 
one end of the world to the other. Therefore no place on earth is too far removed for his 
help. Thus he serves as a protector of the just and pious, hovering over them and guard- 
ing them against evil and saving them from danger. 

Some say that Elijah was originally created as an angel, and later he descended to earth 
as the prophet Elijah. Others say that the heavenly Elijah is none other than the angel 
Sandalphon, one of the greatest and mightiest of the heavenly hosts. Thus, Elijah is known 
as Sandalphon on high, but when he descends to this world, he is known as Elijah. 

Elijah is not only an important prophet, but the manner of his departure from earth, 
carried into heaven in a fiery chariot, inspired extensive rabbinic and folk traditions 
about Elijah's role after he was taken into Paradise. There are hundreds of tales about 
Elijah returning to earth as God's messenger, meeting with the great sages of subse- 
quent generations and assisting the poor in their times of desperation. It was Elijah 
who was said to have taught Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai the secrets of heaven that were 
later written down in the Zohar, during the 13 years Shimon bar Yohai remained in 
hiding in a cave from the Romans. In this role as a teacher, Elijah created the role of the 
Tzaddik, who imparts holy secrets to those worthy of receiving them. And it is Elijah 
whom, it is said, will sound the hom of the ram that Abraham sacrificed at Mount 
Moriah to announce the beginning of the messianic era. 

In addition to these traditions about Elijah's role in this world, there are tales about 
Elijah's role in heaven. Here he is described as having been transformed into an angel, 
or, in an alternate version, having been created as an angel in the first place. One myth 
identifies him as the angel Sandalphon when he is in heaven, and as Elijah when he 
descends to this world. See "The Angel Sandalphon," p. 197. 

The most striking parallel to Elijah is the myth of Enoch. Just as Elijah was carried 
into paradise in a chariot, so too was Enoch brought into heaven the same way when 
God took him (Gen. 5:24). And just as Elijah is described here as being transformed into 
angel, so too was Enoch transformed into the angel Metatron. Both of them are among 
the most important angels, taking orders directly from God. In fact, it seems likely that 
the extensive mythic tradition about Enoch was inspired by the description of Elijah 
being taken into heaven in a fiery chariot. See "The Metamorphosis of Enoch," p. 156.

238. THE KEEPER OF THE BOOK OF RECORDS 

There is a heavenly prince, Radweriel, who is the Keeper of the Book of Records. Out of 
every word that issues from his mouth, an angel is created. He fetches the case of writ- 
ings with the Book of Records in it, and brings it before God. And he breaks the seal of the 
case, opens it, takes out the book and delivers it to God. And God receives it and gives it 
to the heavenly scribes, that they may read it in the Great Court of Justice, in the highest 
heaven, before the heavenly household. 

There are a multitude of angels listed in various ancient Jewish texts, each with his 
own particular role to play. Although Metatron is identified as the heavenly scribe, 
Radweriel is identified as the Keeper of the Book of Records. This is the book that 
contains a record of everything that a person does, so that on Rosh ha-Shanah God can 
weigh their good and bad deeds and make a decision about whether their lives should 
be renewed for another year, a decision that is sealed ten days later on Yom Kippur. 



THE MINISTERING ANGELS 199 


One strange detail about Radweriel suggests that his power is exceptionally great, 
for each time he speaks, an angel is created. Since God is said to be the Creator of 
everything, including the angels, the notion that one angel has the power to create 
other angels implies a shift of one of God's primary roles. See "The Book of Life and 
the Book of Death," p. 289. 

Sources : 

B. Avot 3; 3 Enoch 27:1-3. 


239. THE ANGEL GALLIZUR 

God does not utter evil decrees Himself, as it is said, It is not at the word of the Most High, 
that weal and woe befall (Lam. 3:38). Instead, God has the angel Gallizur utter all evil de- 
crees. Gallizur also reveals the secrets of God. So too does he open his wings to absorb the 
fiery breath of the creatures of the chariot, for if he did not absorb it, the angels would be 
consumed by their fiery breath. Gallizur also takes braziers filled with coals from the 
river Rigyon, the river of fire, whose coals consume angels and men, and he holds these 
up near angels and kings, so that fear of the angels and kings will strike the world. 

This obscure angel is in charge of pronouncing God's evil decrees. This is an at- 
tempt to resolve the theological problem of God's role in the existence of evil. In mono- 
theism, God is responsible for both good and evil. On the other hand, God is portrayed 
as being entirely good, and it would be inappropriate and unseemly for God to pro- 
nounce evil decrees, as stated in Lamentations 3:38. Therefore the angel Gallizur takes 
over this role and pronounces evil decrees for God. There is perhaps a hint here of a 
Gnostic dualism.

Pesikta Rabbati 20:4; Sefer ha-Zikhronot 52:8. 


240. THE ANGEL OF CONCEPTION 

Among the angels there is one who serves as the midwife of souls. This is Lailah, the Angel 
of Conception. When the time has come for a man and his wife to conceive a child, God 
directs Lailah to seek out a certain soul hidden in the Garden of Eden, and command it to 
enter a drop of semen. At first the soul refuses, for it still remembers the pain of being bom, 
and it prefers to remain pure. But Lailah compels the soul to obey, and that is when God 
decrees what the fate of that sperm will be, whether male or female, strong or weak, rich or 
poor, and so on. Then the angel turns around and places the soul in the womb of the mother. 

While the infant grows in the womb, Lailah places a lighted candle at the head of the 
unborn infant, so he can see from one end of the world to the other, as it is said. His lamp 
shone above my head , and by His light I walked through darkness (Job 29:3). For nine months 
Lailah watches over the unborn infant, teaching him the entire Torah as well as the history 
of his soul. During this time, the evil inclination has no power over him. And before he is 
bom, he is given an oath to keep his soul pure, lest God take it back from him. Then Lailah 
leads the child into the Garden of Eden, and shows him the righteous ones with crowns on 
their heads. So too does Lailah lead the child to the netherworld and show him the punish- 
ments of Gehenna. But when the time has come to be bom, the angel extinguishes the 
lamp, and brings forth the child into the world. The instant the child emerges, Lailah lightly 
strikes the newborn above the lip, causing it to cry out. And at that instant the infant forgets 
all it has learned. That is the origin of the mark on the upper lip, which everyone bears. 

Indeed, Lailah is a guardian angel, who watches over that child all of his days. And 
when the time has come to take leave of this world, it is Lailah who comes to him and 



200 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


says, "Do you not recognize me? The time of your departure has come. I have come to 
take you from this world." Thereupon Lailah leads him to the World to Come, where he 
renders an accounting before God, and he is judged according to his merits. 

This myth describes the formation of a child. The soul is here revealed to have 
been drawn from on high and sent to this world reluctantly. Such a myth affirms the 
rabbinic belief in the essential purity of the human soul, which is subjected to the 
power of the Yetzer ha-Ra, the Evil Inclination. This myth of conception is also a re- 
minder of God's powerful role in every stage of our lives. A famous passage in Pirke 
Avot 3:1 says: "Know where you came from, where you are going, and before whom 
you will in the future have to give account and reckoning. Where you came from — 
from a fetid drop; where you are going— to a place of dust, worms and maggots; and 
before whom you will in the future have to give account and reckoning — before God, 
the Supreme King of kings." 

According to Rabbi Meir ibn Gabbai in Avodat ha-Kodesh, "Before a soul descends 
to this world, it recognizes the Oneness of God and grasps the secrets of the Torah." 

He links this intrinsic knowledge of the soul with the verse Open my eyes that I may 
perceive the wonder of Your teachings (Psalms 119:18). These are the wonders that were 
apprehended before the child was born. 

Although angels are generally regarded as sexless, and some rabbinic sources say 
they do not procreate, almost all of them bear male names such as Michael or Gabriel 
and they have male characteristics. In addition, the noun, malakh (angel) is grammati- 
cally masculine. However, Yalkut Hadash (Mai. 63 and 93) says: "It is appropriate to 
distinguish between male and female angels." And there is one angel, the angel Lailah, 
who has distinctly feminine characteristics. This angel is responsible for the fetus, for 
assisting at birth, and for guiding the soul from this world to the next. In many ways 
Lailah is the polar opposite of Lilith, who wastes seed, is not maternal, and is bent on 
destruction, not creation. While the word Lailah, meaning "night," is masculine, the 
name Lailah is feminine, and the name of this angel does not end in the usual "el," 
representing God's Name. Thus, even though there is no direct evidence that Lailah is 
a feminine angel, the name Lailah and the role of the angel strongly indicate feminine 
characteristics. 

Lailah, the angel's name, likely derives from a rabbinic discussion in B. Niddah 16b, 
where conception is described as taking place at night. There the name of the angel in 
charge of conception is identified as "Night" (lailah). This angel takes a drop and places 
it before God. B. Niddah 30b adds important details about the formation of the embryo 
and the role of Lailah. It explains that a light shining above the unborn infant's head lets 
the child see from one end of the world to the other. At the same time, the angel teaches 
the unborn child the Torah. But as soon as the child is born, the angel strikes it on the 
upper lip, causing the infant to forget all he has learned. The full myth of Lailah and the 
formation of the embryo is found in Midrash Tanhuma Pekudei 3. For more on the tradi- 
tion of guardian angels in Judaism, see "Guardian Angels," p. 202. 

According to Rabbi Menashe ben Israel in Nishmat Hayim 2:18, God breathes the 
soul into a person at conception, much as He did with Adam, when He blew into his 
nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living being (Gen. 2:7). This appears to be an 
alternate explanation for the version portrayed in the myth of Lailah, where the angel 
orders the soul to enter the seed.

241. THE ANGEL OF THE COVENANT 

Whoever has the sign of the circumcision sealed in his flesh will not descend to Gehenna. 
When a man brings his son into the covenant of the circumcision, God calls upon the 
angels and says to them, "Come and see what my sons are doing in the world." At that 
time Elijah, the Angel of the Covenant, swoops down to earth in four leaps. For this 
reason, a chair must be prepared in Elijah's honor, and one should say, "This is the chair 
of Elijah." If this is not done, Elijah does not dwell there. Then Elijah ascends on high and 
testifies before God about whether or not a man has circumcised his son. 

The covenant of circumcision (b'rit) is performed on Jewish boys on the eighth day 
after their birth. The ceremony includes a chair identified as the chair of Elijah, and 
Elijah is believed to be present at the ceremony. For this reason, Elijah, who was taken 
up into heaven in a whirlwind in 2 Kings 2:11, is identified as the angel of the covenant. 

This ritual of the b'rit derives from Abraham's circumcision in Genesis 17:24. This 
is considered the most elemental rite in Judaism, and it was (and in most Jewish homes 
still is) unthinkable that it would not be performed. This covenant was believed to 
provide God's protection for the child, who is believed to be in danger from the forces 
of evil until the ritual of the circumcision is performed. See "Abraham's Vision of 
God," p. 331.

242. HOW RABBI ISHMAEL WAS CONCEIVED 

Rabbi Ishmael, the High Priest, was so handsome that he was said to resemble an angel. 
His mother and father had been childless for many years before he was bom. Rabbi 
Ishmael's father told his wife to pay close attention when she left the mikveh, the ritual 
bath. If anything unpleasant crossed her path, she should return to the bathhouse and 
immerse herself again. Then, perhaps, she would succeed in having a child. 

The next time his wife left the mikveh, a black dog crossed her path. She returned and 
reimmersed herself, but again the dog crossed before her. This happened eight times, 
and each time she reimmersed herself. God was so moved by her righteousness that He 
sent the angel Gabriel to earth. Gabriel took the form of her husband, and met her at the 
door of the bathhouse. He led her home and that night Rabbi Ishmael was conceived. 
And he was as handsome as his father, the angel Gabriel. 

Here the High Priest, Rabbi Ishmael, is said to have been the child of an angel and 
a human, with the angel Gabriel having taken on the appearance of his father and 
having had sexual relations with his mother. That is given as the explanation for Rabbi 
Ishmael's great beauty. 

The union of humans and angels is very unusual in Jewish lore, but there is an 
extensive tradition linked to the rabbinic interpretations of Genesis 6, concerning the 
Sons of God and the daughters of men, where the Sons of God are identified as angels. 

See the series of stories concerning this myth, pp. 454-460.

243. THE ANGEL OF FRIENDSHIP 

Everyone has a light burning for him in the world above, and everyone's light is unique. 
When two friends meet, their lights above are united, and out of that union of two lights an 



202 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


angel is bom. That angel has the strength to survive for only one year, unless its life is re- 
newed when the friends meet again. But if they are separated for more than year, the angel 
begins to languish and eventually wastes away. That is why a blessing over the dead is made 
upon meeting a friend who has not been seen for more than a year, to revive the angel. 

According to the Talmud (B. Berakhot 58b) two friends who have not seen each 
other for a year say the blessing: "Blessed is He who revives the dead." The explana- 
tion for this strange blessing is that an angel comes into existence when two people 
become friends, but the angel dies if they go more than a year without meeting. This 
tradition about the Angel of Friendship has been attributed to Reb Pinhas of Koretz, 

Reb Shmelke of Nicholsberg and Reb Abraham Joshua Heschel of Apta. 

Another tradition about the creation and transformation of angels is attributed to 
Reb Pinhas of Koretz: "Every good deed turns into an angel. But if the deed is imper- 
fect, so is the angel. Perhaps it will be mute. What a disgrace to be served in Paradise 
by such an angel. Or it might have an arm or leg missing. And these imperfections can 
only be repaired by the repentance of the one who brought the imperfect angel into 
being." This kind of transformation is known as tikkun or repair, and it is parallel to 
the mystical cosmology of the Ari, where every good deed is said to raise up a fallen 
spark. 

The theme of good deeds in the transformation of the angels is common in kabbal- 
istic and Hasidic lore. The key passage is Mishneh Avot 4:2: "He who does a mitzvah 
acquires an advocate. He who does a sin acquires an accuser." This notion is further 
developed in Exodus Rabbah 32:6: "The angels are sustained only by the splendor of 
the Shekhinah, and you are their means of sustenance," meaning that a good deed 
creates an angel. Rabbi Hayim Vital confirms this meaning in Sha'arei Kedushah, where 
he writes that "the diligent study of the Law and the performance of the divine com- 
mandments brings about the creation of a new angel." This serves as an explanation 
for the existence of the maggidim, the angelic figures who are said to visit sages and 
bring them heavenly mysteries. Joseph Karo (1488-1575), author of the Shulhan Arukh, 
the code of Jewish law, was famous for being visited by such a maggid. See "The Angel 
of the Mishnah" in Gabriels Palace , pp. 112-113. 

Another source echoed here is found in Ma'asiyot Noraim ve-Nifla'im concerning 
the gaon Rabbi Yehezkel of Prague (1713-1793). He was said to have stated that "The 
angels that are found in the upper world were created by the deeds of the Tzaddikim." 

Note that Reb Pinhas has the angel that comes into being as a result of friendship, or, 
by implication, love, function as a symbolic child. This expands the circumstances for 
the creation of an angel to include angels created by human interaction.

244. GUARDIAN ANGELS 

Each person is given a particular guardian angel, according to his ways. A righteous man 
who speaks the truth is assigned an angel who goes along with him in the ways of the 
righteous and helps him to speak the truth. 

When a man makes himself act like a saint, willing to suffer, he is assigned an angel 
who goes along with him in the way of saints and helps the man to accept all suffering. 

If, on the other hand, a man behaves like one of the wicked, lying and deceiving, he is 
assigned an angel who goes along with him in the way of the wicked and leads him on to 
more deceit. 

And if a man follows a middle way, he is assigned an angel who follows that same 
path, as it is said. Render to each man according to his way (Jer. 27:10). 



THE MINISTERING ANCELS 203 


Some say that every man has two guardian angels, representing the Yetzer ha-Ra, the 
Evil Inclination, and the Yetzer ha-Tov, the Good Inclination. And these angels who ac- 
company a man testify before God about his acts. 

There are multiple myths about guardian angels in Judaism, as well as a rabbinic 
debate about whether each person has one or two guardian angels. The position of 
Maimonides in Guide to the Perplexed is that every person is accompanied by two an- 
gels, one on the right side and one on the left. Eliyahu Zuta explains that the nature of 
a person's guardian angel is a mirror of that person, and can lead the person on to 
good or to evil. The notion of an angel luring a person into evil is strange, and seems 
to be intentionally avoiding the use of demons. Usually angels are not distinguished 
by their individuality, but this myth suggests that they share the same strengths and 
weaknesses of those they guard. 

Here the verse from Jeremiah 27:10, "7 give to every man according to his ways/' is 
interpreted to mean that God gives them an angel. 

See "The Sabbath Angels/' p. 315. See also "The Angel of Conception," p. 199, about 
the angel Lailah, who plays a role very much like that of a guardian angel.

245. THE MIGHT OF THE ANGELS 

God's angels are mighty, but they are not the equal of God. So great is the size of the 
angels, that the distance from heaven to earth is no more than the palm of an angel. Proof 
of the might of the angels is demonstrated by the fact that one of them stretched forth his 
hand from heaven and grasped Ezekiel by a lock of his hair, as it is said. He stretched out 
the form of a hand , and took me by the hair of my head (Ezek. 8:3). This teaches us that there is 
no limit to God's ministering angels. How much more so, then, is there no limit to God. 

This brief myth attempts to convey the great size and power of the angels, while 
emphasizing that the angels themselves are still subject to God. Since the size of the 
angels is so gigantic — with the palm of an angel as big as the distance from heaven to 
earth — the immense size and power of God cannot even be imagined. 

From a mythological perspective, this myth attributes the kind of size and power 
to the angels that other gods have in Babylonian or Canaanite or Greek mythology, 
but, at the same time, it attempts to reinforce the monotheistic concept that the angels 
are still subject to God's will.

246. THE ANGEL OF LOSSES 

There is an angel who watches over people, even in the dark. This is Yode'a, the Angel of 
Losses. He watches lives unfold, recording every detail before it fades. This angel has 
servants, and his servants have servants. Some of these servants are angels, and some are 
not. Each of the angels carries a shovel, and they spend all their time digging, searching 
for losses. For a great deal is lost in our lives. 

Every Tzaddik is a servant of the angel Yode'a, for even a Tzaddik who searches after 
lost things is himself sometimes lost. Then it is necessary to search in the dark, in the 



204 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


realm of the unknown. And with what do you search in the darkness? With the light of 
the soul. For the soul is a light planted in the Tzaddik to seek after whatever has been lost. 

What kind of light is it? Not a torch, but a small candle. Yet even so, with it you can 
search inside deep wells, where darkness is unbroken, peering into every comer and 
crevice. It is necessary to be guided by that light, small though it may be. 

This is a teaching of Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav. Rabbi Nachman appears to have 
invented this angel, Yode'a, the angel of losses. Much like Reb Pinhas of Koretz, Rabbi 
Nachman was highly aware of surrounding spirits. For Reb Pinhas these were often 
angels. See, for example, "The Angel of Friendship," p. 201. Here too Rabbi Nachman 
recognizes an angel that is invisible to all the others. In this case it is an obscure angel 
that he finds, the Angel of Losses. This angel, along with his servants, searches for 
what has been lost. The kind of work that this angel does is clearly linked to the myth 
of the Ari, for the second phase of this myth concerns gathering the scattered sparks. 

These are not unlike the losses that Yode'a collects, for the sparks too have been lost. 

Yode a means "to know." Thus the angel's name reflects its purpose, which is to 
recall all that has been lost. See "The Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the 
Sparks," p. 122.

247. THE ANGEL TZADKIEL 

It is the angel Tzadkiel who dresses each soul that enters Paradise in a garment of great 
purity, woven by the Bride of God. So too was Tzadkiel the teacher of Abraham. It was he 
who taught him the ways of wisdom. 

For the first year after the Ari died. Rabbi Hayim Vital never dreamed of his master. In 
time he began to fear that the Ari was angry with him or thought him an unworthy 
disciple. Hayim Vital confided these fears to Rabbi Yehoshua Albuv. Rabbi Yehoshua 
told him that he knew a holy name that could invoke the angel Tzadkiel, and that this 
angel could reveal to him the reason for the Ari's absence. But this angel could be seen 
only in a mirror. 

Rabbi Yehoshua taught the secret name to Hayim Vital. For the next week he fasted 
and immersed himself in the mikveh. Then, on the fifth of Av, the yahrzeit (anniversary) of 
the death of the Ari, Hayim Vital stood before a mirror and pronounced the holy name. 
All at once there was a blinding light in the mirror, and Hayim Vital shut his eyes. And 
when he opened them, he was barely able to make out a presence in the mirror. And as 
his eyes adjusted to that great light, he recognized that it was indeed an angel. 

The angel spoke first and said: "I have come at your command. What is it you wish to 
know?" And Hayim Vital replied: "Tell me first who you are." And the angel revealed 
that it was Tzadkiel. 

Then Hayim Vital asked the angel for help in contacting the Ari in the World to Come, 
for since his death the Ari had been silent. And Hayim Vital also asked if he had some- 
how sinned and was therefore unworthy of the Ari's presence in his dreams. 

In reply Tzadkiel said: "Know that the holy Ari has prepared a place for you in Para- 
dise, at his side, along with Rabbi Akiba and Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai. For you are a 
true Tzaddik in the eyes of God. Yet there is one sin that holds the Ari back from visiting 
you in the world of dreams." 

And Hayim Vital asked: "What sin is this?" 

The angel said: "In your life, you are perfect. But you have not done enough to see that 
others truly repent, to make the coming of the Messiah possible. Until you accept the 



THE MINISTERIN6 AN6ELS 205 


burden of being a Tzaddik and bring others to repentance, the Ari will hold back from 
visiting you. But if you accomplish this, he will guide you in your dreams as he did when 
he was in this world." 

Then Hayim Vital swore that he would do everything to make others aware of the 
power of repentance to hasten the End of Days. And when the angel had witnessed this 
vow, he vanished from the mirror and was gone. So night and day Hayim Vital devoted 
himself to fulfilling his vow, and before the year was out the Ari began to visit him in his 
dreams, and once more became his guide. 

Here the figure who assists Hayim Vital is Rabbi Yehoshua Albuv. Hayim Vital also 
seeks the help of Rabbi Yehoshua in invoking Elijah in another story in Shivhei Rabbi 
Hayim Vital , p. 91. 

Hayim Vital was very interested in the mystical process of invoking angels. Here he 
invokes the angel Tzadkiel, who is mentioned many times in the Zohar and early kabbalistic 
texts, including Sefer Yetzirah. Tzadkiel is identified as a companion of the angel Gabriel. 

He is also identified as the good angel in the famous legend of the two angels who follow 
a man home from the synagogue (B. Shab. 119b). See "The Sabbath Angels," p. 315. 

According to Siddur Shaar Shamayim, Tzadkiel is the name of the good angel, and 
the evil angel is Samael, the Evil One. In the present story, Hayim Vital invokes the 
angel, which he must view in a mirror, as is customary, as divine beings cannot be 
seen face to face. The angel confirms that heaven regards him as a Tzaddik , but urges 
him to use his powers to cause others to repent, suggesting that Vital's failure to do so 
has caused the soul of the Ari, his master, to keep his distance after death. Note that 
this tale emphasizes the almost messianic role in which Hayim Vital viewed himself 
while acknowledging some failure on his part to inspire others to repent.

248. THE ANGEL OF RAIN 

The Angel of Rain encompasses all miracles. Resembling an ox whose lip has been split 
open, this angel stands between the Deep and the Deep. That is the meaning of Deep calls 
to deep (Ps. 42:8). The Angel of Rain stands between these two Deeps and brings about 
miracles both above and below. 

The concept of the Deep, tehom , first appears in Genesis 1:2: Now the earth was un- 
formed and void , and darkness was upon the face of the Deep. According to Exodus Rabbah 
5:9, there are upper miracles, which correspond to the Upper Deep, and lower miracles, 
which correspond to the Lower Deep. Just as rain fertilizes the earth and makes it 
possible for things to grow, so the Angel of Rain facilitates miracles above and below. 

The Angel of Rain is referred to as B'ree in Job 26:7.

249. GOD CHANGES THE ROLES OF THE ANGELS 

Before the enemy came, Jeremiah warned the people to repent so they would not have to 
go into exile. But the people said, "If the enemy comes, what can they do to us? By invok- 
ing the aid of one of the celestial princes we can surround the city with a wall of water, 
and by invoking the aid of another, we can surround it with a wall of fire, while another 
angel will surround it with a wall of iron." 



206 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


Hearing this, God said, "They would avail themselves of My angelic host." So God 
changed the roles of the angels, setting the angel who had dominion over water to have 
dominion over fire, and the one who had dominion over fire to have dominion over iron. 
So that when the names of the angels were invoked, they did not respond, for they had 
been removed from control of those elements. 

This myth expands on the verses: He has brought low in dishonor the kingdom and its 
leaders (Lam. 2:2) and So I profaned the holy princes (Isa. 43:28). Here the princes are 
understood to refer to the celestial princes, especially those that are in charge of ele- 
ments such as fire and water. This should be regarded as a polemical myth, opposing 
the use of (and dependence on) the invocation of the names of angels to accomplish 
magical goals. For other examples of polemic myths, see "Adam the Last and First," 
p. 129 and "Jacob's Image Cast Out of Heaven," p. 368. For one of the best examples of 
a polemic myth see "The Homunculus of Maimonides," p. 284.

250. THE CREATION OF THE ANGEL OF DEATH 

Some say that the only thing created on the first day of creation was the Angel of Death. How 
do we know this? By the word "darkness" in the verse Darkness was over the face of the deep 
(Gen. 1:2). But others say that when God created the world, there was no Angel of Death. 

So when was the Angel of Death created? Some say it was at the time of the sin of 
Adam and Eve, for the serpent was the Angel of Death, and it caused death for the entire 
world. But others say that the Angel of Death did not come into being until Cain slew 
Abel, for until then no one had died, and there was no need for such an angel. Then God 
transformed Cain into the Angel of Death, as punishment for having slain his brother, 
and that is how the Angel of Death came into being. 

Cain served as the Angel of Death for one hundred and thirty years, wandering and 
roaming about, accursed. After the death of Cain, Lamech took his place as the Angel of 
Death. 


This myth attempts to determine when the Angel of Death was created based on the 
appropriate biblical episode. Because the serpent in the Garden of Eden led Adam and 
Eve into a sin that brought about mortality, it is identified in the Zohar as the Angel of 
Death. (Zohar 1:35b also identifies the serpent as Satan and as the Yetzer ha-Ra, the Evil 
Impulse that entices a person to sin and afterward rises up before the heavenly court to 
accuse the sinner.) Likewise, because Cain was the first murderer. Midrash Tanhuma iden- 
tifies him as becoming transformed into the Angel of Death. Cain's descendent, Lamech, 
who was said to have accidentally slain Cain, is also identified as one who took on the 
mantle of the Angel of Death. See "The Death of Cain," p. 451.

251. RABBI JOSHUA BEN LEVI AND THE ANGEL OF DEATH 

When the time came for Rabbi Joshua ben Levi to die, God told the Angel of Death to go 
to him and grant any request he might make. When the Angel of Death revealed himself 
to him. Rabbi Joshua said, "Show me my place in the Garden of Eden." The Angel of 



THE ANGEL OF DEATH 207 


Death agreed to take him there, but Rabbi Joshua said, "Give me your sword. I am afraid 
you may frighten me or kill me on the way/' So the Angel of Death gave him his sword. 

When they arrived at the Garden of Eden, they sat on the wall of the Garden of Eden 
and the angel showed him his place there. Suddenly Rabbi Joshua jumped down from 
the wall into the Garden of Eden, taking the angel's sword with him. The angel demanded 
that he give the sword back, but Rabbi Joshua swore that he would not. At that moment 
a heavenly voice went forth and said, "Give him back his sword. Otherwise he cannot 
perform his duty." So Rabbi Joshua gave the sword back. 

This is a very famous talmudic legend about Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. Because he was 
so pious, God directed the Angel of Death to treat him with special consideration, so 
when Rabbi Joshua asked to see his heavenly reward, the angel took him to the Garden 
of Eden. Rabbi Joshua then tricked the angel by jumping into the Garden (thus entering 
the World to Come without dying) and stealing the angel's sword, without which he 
would be unable to perform his assigned task of slaying the living when their time 
comes to take leave of this world. Rabbi Joshua's behavior may seem childish, but his 
intention — to spare the living the pain of death — can certainly be seen to be admirable. 

By entering the Garden of Eden in this manner. Rabbi Joshua becomes one of the few 
people in rabbinic literature who were said to have entered Paradise alive. 

Derekh Eretz Zuta 1 lists nine who were said to enter Paradise alive. The list in- 
cludes Enoch, Elijah, the Messiah, Eliezer, the servant of Abraham, Hiram, king of 
Tyre, Ebed Melech, the Ethiopian, Jaabez, the son of Rabbi Yehudah ha-Nagid, Bitiah, 
the daughter of Pharaoh, and Serah bat Asher. Note that this list does not include 
Moses, who is said to have ascended into heaven alive. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi, or the 
four sages who were said to have entered Paradise, Rabbi Akiba, Shimon ben Azzai, 
Shimon ben Zoma, and Aher (Elisha ben Abuyah). See "The Ascent of Moses," p. 261 
and "The Four Who Entered Paradise," p. 173. 

Gershon Winkler reports hearing a version of the story of Rabbi Joshua and the 
Angel of Death in which Rabbi Joshua made the angel promise never to show his 
terrifying face — said to be full of eyes (B. A Z 20b) — when coming to take a soul, and 
only then did he return the angel's sword. 

See "The Messiah in Hell," p. 241, which describes Rabbi Joshua ben Levi's subse- 
quent visit to Gehenna after his visit to Paradise.

252. RABBI LOEW AND THE ANGEL OF DEATH 

One night, not long before the Holy Days were to begin. Rabbi Loew glimpsed a light in the 
synagogue across the way, and he wondered who might be there at that hour. He left his 
house, and as he approached the synagogue he saw through the window a strange figure 
standing at the pulpit. The closer Rabbi Loew came, the more sinister did the figure seem, 
and suddenly Rabbi Loew realized who it was — the Angel of Death — and at the same time 
he came close enough to see the angel sharpening a knife over a long scroll on which many 
names were written. Rabbi Loew was pierced with terror and resisted a powerful impulse 
to run away. But a moment later he became calm and self-possessed, and he knew what he 
had to do. As silently as possible he opened the door of the synagogue and came up behind 
the dreaded angel. All at once he snatched the long list out of the angel's hands, tearing it 
away from him, and ran from the synagogue to his home, where he threw the list into the 
flames and watched until every scrap of it had burned to ashes. 



208 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


Now the plague had begun to spread in the city, and that was the list of victims the 
Angel of Death had come to take in one fell swoop. Now only those on the piece of the list 
left in his hands fell victim to him; all the rest were spared. But among those on the list was 
Rabbi Loew, and it was he, above all, whom the deadly angel was determined to capture. 

Rabbi Loew, who could read the lines of the future, knew that the angel would try to 
snatch him to seek revenge. But Rabbi Loew used his powers to avoid the angel, much as 
King David had done, studying Torah day and night. For the Angel of Death is forbidden 
to take a man while he is engaged in the study of Torah. Yet even so, the angel found a 
ruse by which to capture him. He hid in a rose of great beauty that grew in the garden of 
Rabbi Loew's grandson. One day the boy picked the rose as a gift for his grandfather, and 
as he held it in his hands to present to Rabbi Loew, the rabbi perceived the presence of the 
dark angel, hidden in the rose. Then he did not hesitate, but accepted the gift from his 
grandson, for he knew that if he did not, the boy's life would be endangered. But no 
sooner did Rabbi Loew take it in his hand than the Angel of Death struck him like a 
serpent and snatched his soul. 

The most famous tale of an encounter with the Angel of Death is that of King David, 
found in the Talmud. Here David learns that he is fated to die on a Sabbath. Knowing 
that the Angel of Death is forbidden to snatch a man while he is studying, David 
spends every Sabbath immersed in study. In frustration the Angel of Death creates a 
ruse by shaking a tree outside his study, and when David goes out to investigate, the 
angel snatches his life (B. Shab. 30a-b). A common theme found in folklore is that of 
the snake hidden in a rose, who bites the one who picks it. Such a theme is found in 
"The Princess and the Rose” in the medieval collection Sefer Sha’ashuim. 

Another key legend of an encounter with the Angel of Death is found in the 
pseudepigraphal text The Testament of Abraham. Here the Angel of Death disguises 
himself as a young man of mild appearance, but reveals his true appearance when 
Abraham demands it. The description of its terrible face is one of the most horrible to 
be found anywhere. It is such a face that overwhelms the father and mother in "The 
Bridegroom and the Angel of Death" in Hibbur ha-Ma'asiyot ve-ha-Midrashot ve-ha- 
Aggadot. In this story, the next of kin of the bridegroom all offer to take his place to 
spare him being snatched by the Angel of Death, until the moment of truth, when all 
back out, except for the bride, who so impresses God with her willingness to die that 
both bride and bridegroom are spared. See "The Bridegroom and the Angel of Death" 
in Gabriel’s Palace, pp. 162-164. 

A major study of the legends of the Angel of Death was undertaken by Haim 
Schwarzbaum in the last years of his life. Professor Dov Noy tells the story that he 
once asked Schwarzbaum why it was taking him so long to finish his book on the 
Angel of Death. Schwarzbaum replied that he believed the Angel of Death would 
prefer to take him after he had finished the book, and that is why he was taking his 
time. Unfortunately, he died before the book was completed.

253. THE HEAVENLY COURT 


God does nothing without consulting the Heavenly Court, as it is said. This sentence is 
decreed by the Watchers; this verdict is commanded by the Holy Ones (Dan. 4:14). Nor does a 
day pass when God does not pass a new law in the Heavenly Court. For every day God 
creates new rules and regulations for the guidance of humankind. 



THE CATES OF HEAVEN 209 


It is not clear who are the members of the Heavenly Court. They may be identified 
with the Council of Souls. See "The Council of Souls," p. 160. Psalm 89:7-8 depicts God 
as the head of a council of other gods, which may be the origin of the heavenly court. 
The heavenly court may also be identified, through the verse from Daniel 4:14, with the 
Watchers. The identities of all three groups, the Heavenly Court, the Council of Souls 
and the Watchers seem to intersect and blur. However, in the pseudepigraphic Enoch 
literature the Watchers are identified with a group of rebellious angels. According to 
Rabbi Hayim of Volozhin, the judges of the heavenly court are the Tzaddikim of their 
generation, since angels cannot understand how a person can sin (Efz ha-Hayim 150).

254. THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN 

When Manasseh reigned as king over Jerusalem, he wrought much evil in the sight of the Lord (2 
Chron. 33:6). But when Manasseh was carried away to Babylon bound in fetters, he 
humbled himself before the Lord and prayed to Him. 

Now all the ministering angels went and closed the windows of heaven, so that the 
prayer of Manasseh should not reach God. 

God replied, "If I do not accept him as a penitent, I shall lock the door before all who 
would repent." Then what did God do? He made an opening through the heavens under 
His Throne of Glory and heard Manasseh's supplication and received his entreaty, and 
brought him back to Jerusalem. 

This myth emphasizes the power of repentance, even for those who have commit- 
ted terrible sins. The mythical imagery found here is quite amazing— God makes an 
opening in heaven, reaches down and picks Manasseh up and carries him from Babylon 
to Jerusalem. 

A similarly surprising tradition about repentance is found concerning Cain. An 
encounter is reported in Genesis Rabbah 22:13 between Adam and Cain many years 
after Cain was punished. "How did your case go?" Adam asked. "I repented and am 
reconciled, replied Cain. Hearing thus, Adam struck his face, crying, "So great is the 
power of repentance, and I did not know!" Then he arose and exclaimed. It is a good 
thing to make confession unto the Lord (Ps. 92:1).

255. THE BA'AL SHEM TOV ASCENDS ON HIGH 

On Rosh ha-Shanah of 5507 [1746] the Ba'al Shem Tov made an adjuration, pronounced a 
holy name, and ascended on high. In the vision that followed, he saw wondrous things 
that he had never seen before, and he learned things that words cannot express. 

First he reached the Garden of Eden, where the souls of the righteous pass on their 
way to Paradise. There he saw many souls, some known to him and some unknown, and 
he discovered that it was a special time of grace. Many wicked people had repented, and 
their sins had been forgiven. It was wondrous for him to see how many were accepted as 
penitents. They were in a state of great rapture, and were about to ascend on high. 

All of them entreated the Ba al Shem Tov to ascend with them, to be their guide, and 
because of their great joy, he resolved to ascend together with them. But he knew there 
were great dangers involved in ascending into the highest heavens, so he called upon his 
teacher, the prophet Ahijah, to accompany him. All of them entered the column in the 
Garden of Eden that serves as a path to Paradise and began their ascent. 



210 MYTHS OF HEAVEN 


As they journeyed on high, the Ba'al Shem Tov led those souls through the hidden 
palaces of heaven, one after another. All the mysteries of heaven are concealed in those 
palaces, as well as all the treasuries of heaven. 

The Ba al Shem Tov rose from rung to rung until he reached the palace of the Messiah 
in the highest heaven. There the Messiah teaches Torah with all the sages and saints and 
the Seven Shepherds. They greeted him with such great rejoicing that he was afraid that 
his soul had taken leave of the world, but they assured him that the time had not come 
for his soul to depart from his body. At last he asked the Messiah, "When will my Master 
come?" And the Messiah replied, "When your teachings are known in the world, and 
others are capable of ascending on high like you." 

This account, from a famous letter attributed to the Ba'al Shem Tov (ca. 1700-1760), 
describes a heavenly ascent on Rosh ha-Shanah 5507 (September 1746). Rosh ha-Shanah! 
the New Year, is the traditional Day of Judgment when God decides people's fate. See 
"The Book of Life and the Book of Death," p. 289. 

This letter was said to have been written by the Ba'al Shem Tov to his brother-in- 
law, Rabbi Abraham Gershon of Kittov, when the latter was in the Land of Israel. It is 
one of the only examples of writings by the Ba'al Shem Tov. In Ben Porat Yosef, where 
the letter was first published, the author. Rabbi Yakov Yosef of Polnoye (1704-1784), 
stated that the Ba'al Shem Tov gave him the letter to deliver to his brother-in-law! 

Rabbi Gershon. But Rabbi Yakov Yosef was unable to make the journey to the Holy 
Land, and therefore the letter remained with him. This indicates the authenticity of 
the letter. 

One of the Ushpizin, as the Seven Shepherds are known, is said to visit a righteous 
man s sukkah on each of the nights of Sukkot — if properly invited. There are varying 
lists of the identities of the Seven Shepherds. According to Micah 5:4 and B. Sukkah 
52b, they are Adam, Seth, Methuselah, David, Abraham, Jacob, and Moses. According 
to the Zohar (3:103b-104a), they are Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, together with Moses, 

Aaron, and Joseph, plus King David. The Ba'al Shem Tov does not specify the names 
of the Seven Shepherds he encounters, but they are likely to be the list of those found 
in the Zohar , where Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron and Joseph each represent 
one of the sefirot from Hesed to Yesod. See "The Seven Shepherds," p. 299.

THE UNFINISHED CORNER OF CREATION 


256. THE UNFINISHED CORNER OF CREATION 

All of Creation had been completed except for the northern comer of the world. God 
began to create it, but left it unfinished, saying, "Whoever declares himself to be God, let 
him come and finish this corner, and then all shall know he is a god." There, in that 
unfinished corner, demons, winds, earthquakes, and evil spirits dwell, and from there 
they come forth to the world, as it is said. From the north shall disaster break loose (Jer. 1:14). 
When the Sabbath departs, great bands of evil spirits set out from there and roam the 
world. 


Because of the cold north wind, the north was identified as the abode of evil spir- 
its. This myth explains why — because that part of creation is unfinished. Here God 
makes a challenge to those who assert that they are divinities. The true test for a di- 
vinity is the ability to create a world. So God left one comer of the world unfinished, 
with the challenge that anyone who could finish it would indeed be a true god. Of 
course, the clear implication is that such a creation would be impossible. 

Rabbi Moshe Hayim Luzzatto offers a different perspective about unfinished cre- 
ation: "God began Creation but left it unfinished so that man could eventually bring it 
to completion" (Adir ba-Marom). 

The Kotzker Rebbe said of this unfinished comer of creation: "One little comer — 
God left one little corner in darkness so that we may hide in it!"

257. THE DARKNESS THAT EXISTED BEFORE CREATION 

What happened to the darkness that existed before the creation of the world? Some say it 
is hidden in the seventh compartment of Gehenna. That compartment contains six na- 
tions of the world, but they cannot see each other on account of the darkness. The heretic 
Elisha ben Abuyah is said to reside there. 

The description of darkness found in Genesis, the earth being unformed and void , with 
darkness over the surface of the deep (Gen. 1:2), is quite ambiguous. Instead of stating that 
God created the darkness, the text seems to be saying that the darkness already ex- 
isted — it was already upon the face of the deep. What is unclear is the meaning of dark- 
ness: whether it is to be understood as an absence of light, in the way that "unformed 
and void" suggests an absence. Or is darkness to be understood as a physical element, 
such as light? One possible answer to this question is given by Isaiah, who quotes 
God as saying, "I form light and create darkness" (Isa. 45:7). Here the difference depends 
on the word yotzer , "forming," and borei, "creating." The key here is that what God 
only forms, not creates, must have pre-existed. That, ultimately, may be the meaning 
of darkness was upon the face of the deep — the darkness was already there, a pre-existing 
element. This suggests a Gnostic view of the Creation, in which the Creator is some- 
thing less than a supreme divinity. For another text with such Gnostic undertones, see 
"Light from the Temple," p. 411.

214 MYTHS OF HELL 


258. THE BANISHMENT OF DUMAH 

The angel Dumah was the celestial Prince of Egypt. When Moses said that God would 
exercise judgment against the gods of Egypt, Dumah ran away four hundred parasangs. 
Then God said to him: "It is My decree!" And at that moment Dumah's power and do- 
minion were taken away from him, and he was banished to the lower regions and ap- 
pointed over the realms of Gehenna and the angels of destruction. Thus he' serves as 
judge of all the souls of the wicked. 

Dumah sees to it that the wicked are punished every day of the week, except for the 
Sabbath, when they are released. But at the close of the Sabbath Dumah casts their souls 
back into Gehenna, and their punishments begin anew. 

This myth is clearly intended to parallel that of the fall of Lucifer. Just as Lucifer 
was an angel who rebelled against God and was cast out of heaven, so here the angel 
Dumah rebels upon learning that God planned to defeat Egypt, since Dumah is the 
celestial prince of Egypt. And just as Lucifer is identified with the Devil and said to 
rule in hell, so too is Dumah assigned to rule over Gehenna, Jewish hell. Other sources 
identify the prince of Gehenna as Arsiel. Midrash ha-Ne'elam in Zohar Hadash 25a-b 
describes Arsiel as standing before the souls of the righteous to prevent them from 
praying for the wicked before God. He demands that they also be placed under his 
dominion so that he can take them down to the netherworld, as it is said. Let me have 
the souls (Gen. 14:21). 

Although Lucifer's fall is rooted in Jewish sources, the myth was primarily taken 
up in Christian lore, and the myths of Lucifer and the Devil became merged into one. 

See "The Fall of Lucifer," p. 108. 

Concerning the release of wicked souls on the Sabbath, see "Sabbath in Gehenna," 
p. 238. For more on the angel Dumah, see "The Punishments of Gehenna," p. 236. 
Because of his role as the angel in charge of Gehenna, Dumah is sometimes 
misidentified as the Angel of Death.

259. GOD'S PRISON 

There is a dreadful abyss at the end of heaven and earth where there is no firmament of 
the heavens above, and no earth beneath it. Columns of heavenly fire fill the abyss, the 
smell of sulphur is everywhere, and around it there is a wasteland without water; with 
no birds to be seen. 

This place is God's prison for rebellious stars and fallen angels. In it are seven stars burn- 
ing like great mountains as they roll over the fire of the abyss. Because they did not come 
forth at their appointed times, God has bound them in that place for ten thousand years. 

There, too, are imprisoned the fallen angels who deceived mankind into making sacri- 
fices to demons as if they were gods, and those who went astray with the daughters of 
men and defiled them. 

This bleak abyss, a kind of protohell, holds seven stars that transgressed God's 
command to come forth, as well as fallen angels who have been imprisoned. This is 
one of the places shown to Enoch in 1 Enoch. For more on the mythic account of the 
fallen angels see "The Watchers," p. 457.

THE UNFINISHED CORNER OF CREATION 215 


260. ADAM AND THE DEMONS 

After the expulsion from Eden, Adam was so filled with grief that he separated from his 
wife. Eve, for one hundred and thirty years. What did Adam do for so long? Some say that 
he repented for a hundred and thirty years by standing in the River Gihon until the waters 
reached up to his neck, and he fasted until his body became as wrinkled as seaweed. 

Others say that female demons swarmed around Adam and inflamed him, until they 
succeeded in seducing him. In this way Adam begot mutant demons, both male and 
female, who were half human and half-demonic. At the same time, male demons were 
inflamed by Eve and seduced by her, and she too gave birth to a great many demons. 

Some say it was Lilith, Adam's first wife, who found him alone and lay down by his 
side, and thus were begotten myriads of demons, spirits, and imps. Others say it was not 
Lilith, but her sister, Na'amah, who found Adam there. 

When God saw how Adam had turned away from Eve, He put desire for her back into 
Adam's heart. And when, at last, Adam and Eve were reunited, she bore Seth, who, 
unlike Cain, was the very image of Adam, as it is said, When Adam had lived one hundred 
and thirty years , he begot a son in his likeness after his image , and he named him Seth (Gen. 5:3). 

This strange legend about Adam being seduced by female demons, and Eve seduc- 
ing male ones, grows out of the biblical verse When Adam had lived one hundred and 
thirty years , he begot a son in his likeness after his image , and he named him Seth (Gen. 5:3). 

Since the statement of the birth of Seth follows the mention of 130 years, the rabbis 
assumed that Adam must have withdrawn from Eve for that long. 

Various explanations are given for Adam's separation from Eve. Some attribute it 
to their expulsion from Eden and Adam's realization that death had been decreed 
against the world on his account, while other sources link it to Adam's grief over the 
death of Abel. 

There are also contradictory myths explaining what happened to Adam during the 
130 years. One tells us that Adam repented by standing in the River Gihon, and the 
other assumes that his sexual desire was as great as ever, making him vulnerable to 
female demons, while male demons impregnated Eve. The demons that Adam and 
Eve give birth to are called mazikim. These mazikim and their demonic consorts ac- 
count for the proliferation of demons. The Zohar (3:76b) attributes heavenly beauty to 
the daughters of Adam who were conceived in this way. The reference to Seth being in 
the image of Adam, and some texts say, the seed of Adam, while Cain was not, refers 
to the midrash that attributes Cain's conception to intercourse between Eve and the 
serpent, making Cain the son of the serpent. See "The Seed of Cain," p. 448. 

This myth about Adam echoes the Greek myth of Tantalus, who was punished for 
his crimes by having to stand in a river up to his neck. There he is consumed by hunger 
and thirst. There is a nearby tree, with a branch he could reach, that bears every kind of 
fruit. But if he reaches for it, it pulls away. Likewise, he tries to drink from the river, but 
as soon as he reaches for it, the water subsides. From this punishment comes the term 
"tantalize." Note that the Greek myth focuses the torment on food and water, while the 
Jewish myth focuses on sexual issues. See Greek Myths by Robert Graves, 108d.

216 MYTHS OF HELL 


261 . ADAM AND LILITH 

When God created Adam and saw that he was alone, He created a woman from dust, like 
him, and named her Lilith. But when God brought her to Adam, they immediately began 
to fight. Adam wanted her to lie beneath him, but Lilith insisted that he lie below her. 
When Lilith saw that they would never agree, she uttered God's Name and flew into the 
air and fled from Adam. Then Adam prayed to his Creator, saying, "Master of the Uni- 
verse, the woman you gave me has already left me." So God called upon three angels, 
Senoy, Sansenoy, and Semangelof, to bring her back. God said, "Go and fetch Lilith. If she 
agrees to go back, fine. If not, bring her back by force." 

The angels left at once and caught up with Lilith, who was living in a cave by the Red 
Sea, in the place where Pharaoh's army would drown. They seized her and said, "Your 
maker has commanded you to return to your husband at once. If you agree to come with 
us, fine; if not, we 11 drown one hundred of your demonic offspring every day." 

Lilith said. Go ahead. But don t you know that I was created to strangle newborn 
infants, boys before the eighth day and girls before the twentieth? Let's make a deal. 
Whenever I see your names on an amulet, I will have no power over that infant." When 
the angels saw that was the best they would get from her, they agreed, so long as one 
hundred of her demon children perished every day. 

That is why one hundred of Lilith's demon offspring perish daily, and that is why the 
names of the three angels are written on the amulets hung above the beds of newborn 
children. And when Lilith sees the names of the angels, she remembers her oath, and she 
leaves those children alone. 

The haunting legend of Lilith finds its source in the rabbinic commentary on the 
biblical passage Male and female He created them (Gen. 1:27). It appeared to the rabbis 
that this passage contradicted the sequential creation of Adam and Eve (Gen. 2:21-22). 
Therefore they attempted to resolve this contradiction by saying that Male and female 
He created them referred to Adam's first wife, whom they named Lilith, while Eve, who 
was created later, was Adam's second wife. They chose the name Lilith from Isaiah 
34:14, where Lilith is mentioned (Yea, Lilith shall repose there), in what is believed to be 
a reference to a Babylonian night demoness. 

Even though Lilith seems to leap fully formed out of a line in the Bible, it is likely 
that the legend was already told among the Jewish people, and that the rabbis sought 
out a text to attach it to. In any case, the mythological figure of Lilith almost certainly 
finds its origin in other cultures of the Ancient Near East. Lilith's role as a seducer of 
men is likely to have been based on the Babylonian night demon Lilitu, a succubus who 
seduces men in their sleep, while Lilith's role as a child slayer may well derive from the 
Babylonian demon Lamashtu. It is interesting to note that the roles of l ili tu and Lamashtu 
became blurred together, and Lilith took on the roles of both seducer and child slayer. 

Having brought a powerful figure such as Lilith into being, the rabbis felt com- 
pelled to recount her entire history. In this case, the legend began to grow quite exten- 
sive. The first complete version of it is found in Alpha Beta de-Ben Sira, dating from the 
ninth century in North Africa, the primary source of the myth. 

Here Adam and Lilith are described as having been created at the same time, and 
having fought over everything from the first. They had a final confrontation over the 
question of the missionary position. Adam insisted on it; Lilith refused, preferring the 
opposite, with the female dominant. When they couldn't agree, Lilith pronounced the 
secret Name of God, the Tetragrammaton, YHVH, which has remarkable supernatural 
powers, and flew out of the Garden of Eden and landed on the shore of the Red Sea. There 
Lilith took up residence in a nearby cave and took for lovers all the demons who lived 
there, while Adam, left alone, complained to God that his woman had left him. God sent 
the three angels to command Lilith to return. She refused, and they threatened to kill 100 
of her demon offspring daily. Lilith still refused to return; she was never very maternal. 



LILITH RISES FROM THE DEEP 217 


When Lilith offers a compromise, the myth takes a strange turn. She tells the an- 
gels that she was created to strangle children, boys before the eighth day and girls 
before the twentieth. But if a woman carried an amulet with the words "Out Lilith!" 
on it, along with the names of the angels, she would leave that woman and her chil- 
dren alone. What is really occurring is that another myth is being fused to the first, 
while the issue of Lilith's return to Adam is simply dropped. This second myth con- 
cerns Lilith's role as a child-destroying witch. Indeed, it is possible that a myth con- 
cerning another demoness has been incorporated into that of Lilith. In all likelihood, 
we can identify this demoness as Obyzouth, who is invoked by King Solomon in the 
first century text The Testament of Solomon. The king commands her to describe herself, 
and Obyzouth tells how she seeks to strangle children. Furthermore, she reveals that 
,she can be thwarted by the angel Raphael and by women who write her name on an 
amulet, for then she will flee from them to the other world. What appears to be taking 
place is that the demoness Lilith, who up to this point had been concerned with issues 
of independence and sexuality, here takes on a new aspect from Obyzouth, that of the 
child-destroying witch, by a process of mythic absorption. Why did this happen? Prob- 
ably because Lilith became such a dominant mythic figure that she absorbed the roles 
of die lesser known demoness. This likely occurred very early, between the first and 
third centuries, and Lilith has played a powerful dual role ever since in Jewish folk- 
lore and superstition. See "The Night Demoness," p. 223. 

So it is that Lilith is regarded both as a witch determined to strangle children and 
as the incarnation of lust. In her role as a witch, Lilith's actions provided an explana- 
tion for the terrible plague of infant mortality. Use of amulets against Lilith was wide- 
spread and is still considered necessary in some ultra-Orthodox Jewish circles. Only a 
generation ago grandmothers often tied red ribbons on a child's bed. These ribbons 
symbolically represented the amulet against Lilith and served the same purpose. 

The text of this amulet against Lilith is taken from Sefer Raziel. The amulet against 
Lilith has been found in archeological digs dating back 1,500 years. The traditional 
use of such amulets against Lilith was widespread, and visitors to the ultra-Orthodox 
Mea She'arim section of Jerusalem will even today find protective amulets against 
Lilith available for purchase. Both the text and even the primitive drawings on the 
ancient amulet are still in use. See "A Spell to Banish Lilith," p. 218, for the text.

262. LILITH RISES FROM THE DEEP 

From the crevice of the deep there came a certain evil female spirit whose name was 
Lilith. She had been condemned to imprisonment deep beneath the waves. But God's 
anger at the time of the Fall was so great that God decided to let Lilith go. So the dark 
Lilith, also known as the First Eve, was set free. She hides during the day in caves and 
other dark places. But at night she is free to roam the world. 

That is why it is written that a man may not sleep alone in a house, for Lilith will attempt 
to seduce him. She will slip in if the window is open a crack, slip beneath the door and 
beneath the sheets. Many a man has felt her long hair hanging in his face as he lay asleep, 
dreaming lustful dreams. After she steals his seed, Lilith gives birth to mutant demons, half 
human and half demon, who are destined to be outcasts. Humans will hate them, because 
they are half demon, and demons will hate them because they are half human. 



218 MYTHS OF HELL 


To lead the hearts of men astray, Lilith adorns herself with all manner of decorations, 
and stands at the entrance to roads and paths. She dresses for seduction, with earrings 
from Egypt and jewels hung around her neck. Her hair is long and red, her face white 
and pink, with six pendants hanging from her ears and all the ornaments of the East 
encircling her neck. Her mouth is like a tiny door, her lips beautiful, her words smooth as 
oil, and her tongue sharp as a sword. 

They will encounter her in a forest or a ruin, or in the cellar where an innkeeper takes his 
naps. One fool after another runs after her, drinks from her cup of wine, sleeps on her bed 
of Egyptian flax. And when he wakes up, thinking to sport with her, she takes off her finery 
and turns into a fierce warrior, her garment of flaming fire, her eyes horrific, and causes his 
body and soul to tremble, her sword sharpened with drops of poison. Then she kills him 
with a sharp sword from which bitter drops fall, and casts him into the very pit of hell. 

This account of Lilith from the Zohar demonstrates how she is viewed as a murder- 
ous demon, who uses her sexual powers to destroy men. In the Zohar , Lilith is viewed 
as the primary feminine force of evil, while Samael is the primary male force. While 
in the Talmud (B. Eruvin 100b) Lilith is generally described as having long, black hair, 
there are other sources, such as this one, where her hair is described as red. Some 
sources even assert that Lilith has wings (B. Nidah 24b). This links Lilith even closer to 
the Babylonian night demonesses Lilitu and Lamashtu.

263. A SPELL TO BANISH LILITH 


OUT LILITH! I adjure you, Lilith, in the Name of God, and in the names of the three 
angels sent after you, Senoy, Sansenoy, and Semangelof, to remember the vow you made 
that when you find their names you will cause no harm, neither you nor your cohorts; 
and in their names and in the names of the seals set down here, I adjure you. Queen of 
Demons, and all your multitudes, to cause no harm to a woman while she carries a child 
nor when she gives birth, nor to the children bom to her, neither during the day nor 
during the night, neither through their food nor through their drink, neither in their 
heads nor in their hearts. By the strength of these names and seals I so adjure you, Lilith, 
and all your offspring, to obey this command. 

This text is used to ward off the demoness Lilith in her attempts to strangle new- 
born babies. The text is placed inside of amulets worn by mothers during pregnancy, 
and hung above the beds of babies after they are bom. Lilith played the role of a child- 
destroying witch, for it was she who was blamed for the scourge of infant mortality. 

This text alludes to the story of how Lilith abandoned Adam and the Garden of Eden 
for a cave by the Red Sea. The demons were sent to order her to return to her husband, 
but she refused. After bargaining with the angels, they came to an agreement whereby 
Lilith would not try to harm any mother or infant protected by this amulet. See "Adam 
and Lilith," p. 216.

LILITH RISES FROM THE DEEP 219 


264. THE WOMAN IN THE FOREST 

Lilith seeks, above all, to seduce the best ones, knowing that if she can conquer them, the 
others will fall into her hands as well. Once she decided to try to seduce Rabbi Elimelekh 
of Lizhensk. 

At that time Rabbi Elimelekh was still a young man. He spent all day in the house of 
study, and at night he walked home through the forest, always taking the same path. 

One night, as he was walking through the forest, he saw a light in the distance. Curi- 
ous to know what it was, he left the path and followed the light. Before long he saw that 
it was coming from a cottage, one that he had never before seen in the forest. As he came 
closer, he peered into the window, and there he saw a woman with long, dark hair, who 
was wearing a very thin nightgown. 

As soon as he saw her, Reb Elimelekh knew he did not belong there, and he turned to 
leave. Just then the door to the cottage opened, and the woman called out: "Reb Melekh, 
wait! Please, come in." So Reb Elimelekh went in. Then the woman closed the door and 
stood before him and said: "Reb Melekh, I have seen you pass through the forest many 
times, and I have often hoped you would visit me. You know, I bathed in the spring 
today and I am clean. Surely the sin would be slight, but the pleasure would be abun- 
dant." And she dropped her gown. 

Reb Elimelekh stared at her with disbelief and struggled with himself, as did Jacob 
with the angel. And at last he wrenched out, "No!" At that instant the woman vanished, 
and the cottage disappeared, and Reb Elimelekh found himself standing alone in the 
forest. And there were glowworms at his feet. 

The woman in this tale is not identified, but everyone among the Hasidim who 
heard it knew exactly who she was — Lilith, or one of the daughters of Lilith. So vivid 
was the presence of Lilith in their lives that she became the primary projection of their 
sexual fantasies and fears. 

Lilith, as in this tale, is usually portrayed as having black hair. In fact she is charac- 
terized this way in the Talmud ( B . Eruvin 100b). She is brazen from the first, calling 
Reb Elimelekh not by his full name, Elimelekh, but by his familiar name, Melekh. This 
conveniently lets her avoid pronouncing Eli, "my God," which, as a demoness, she is 
forbidden to do. The fact that her hair is long indicates that she is unmarried, while 
having bathed in the spring informs him that she has purified herself in a mikveh. She 
is appealing to his knowledge of the Law when she tells him that the sin will be slight 
and the pleasure abundant. According to Deuteronomy 22:22, If a man be found lying 
with a married woman, then they shall both die. However, the expected parallel about a 
married man lying with an unmarried woman is missing, and, according to rabbinic 
principles of interpretation, what is not stated is not a law. Therefore, the sin is slight, 
since the law does not identify it as adultery. It is a sin, but not a mortal one. 

Thus Lilith comes equipped with many weapons. She does not only use the power 
of lust, her greatest weapon, but also appeals to his intelligence. Rabbi Elimelekh 
escapes, but only after a considerable struggle. The glowworms at the end indicate 
that Lilith has lost her power over him and Lilith has been revealed in her true form, 
that of a worm. Or, if this story is read as a Hasidic sexual fantasy, that the fantasy has 
reached its climax. 

The fact that the tale is attributed to Reb Elimelekh of Lizhensk indicates that Lilith 
was brazen enough to approach even the holiest of men. Indeed, this was her inten- 
tion. For if she could corrupt the best ones, the others would be sure to follow. Reb 
Elimelekh resists, but barely. The power of the Yetzer ha-Ra , the Evil Inclination, af- 
fects everyone on this earth, even rebbes. There is also a compensating force, the yetzer 
ha-tov , the Good Inclination. But, as might be expected, there is much more heard of 
the Yetzer ha-Ra in Jewish lore than there is of the Yetzer ha-Tov .

220 MYTHS OF HELL 


265. THE CELLAR 

Every impurity engenders demons. Whenever a man's seed is spilled, his demon off- 
spring are conceived. Lilith or one of the daughters of Lilith steals it. A drop is all that is 
needed. 

These demon sons regard the man as their father. They find a place to live in his house, 
whether in an attic or a cellar, or even in a closet. They make their home there. 

Not even married men are safe from the lure of Lilith. No sooner do their wives turn 
their backs, than Lilith seeks out victims among them. She appears to them in dreams 
during the night, and as visions during the day. Sometimes Lilith so sways a man that 
she becomes his secret wife. 

That is what happened in the city of Posen, where there once was a goldsmith who 
was secretly married to Lilith. The demoness lived in the cellar, where the goldsmith had 
his workshop. He spent time with his demon lover every day, while keeping her exist- 
ence secret from his family. Little by little the goldsmith yielded everything to her, lust- 
ing after her day and night. 

Once it happened that the goldsmith even got up in the middle of the Seder, when the 
words "And they went down into Egypt" were read, and he went down to the cellar. His 
wife followed after him, afraid that he was ill. She peered through the keyhole of the 
cellar door, and saw that the cellar had been transformed into a palatial chamber, while 
her husband lay naked in the arms of a lover. Maintaining control of herself, she returned 
to the Seder and revealed nothing to the rest of the family. But the next day she went to 
the rabbi and told him everything. 

The rabbi confronted the man with his sin and he confessed. Then the rabbi gave him 
an amulet to protect himself against Lilith, and he used it to free himself of her. But before 
she would release him, Lilith demanded that the cellar be bequeathed to her and their 
demon offspring for all time, and the man took a vow to this effect. He escaped her 
powers all the rest of his life, but as he lay on his deathbed, his demon children swarmed 
around him, invisible to his human family, crying out his name. 

After his death the house became known as being haunted. Eventually it was sold, 
and the new owner had a workman break open the door to the cellar, which had been 
nailed shut. When that workman was found dead on the threshold. Rabbi Yoel Ba'al 
Shem was sent to investigate. He confirmed that the cellar was infested with demons, 
and he ordered a rabbinic court, a Beit Din, to be convened. The court ruled against the 
demons' right to live in the cellar there, on the grounds that the demons transgressed the 
boundaries of the cellar, and they were expelled into the wilderness. 

One of the most popular and pervasive beliefs in Jewish folk tradition is that the 
demoness Lilith or one of her daughters, the Lilin, seek to steal a man's seed, in order 
to create a demon who is half-human and half-demon. These demonic sons are said to 
haunt their fathers all their lives. The struggle portrayed in this and other similar tales 
can be seen as one between humans and demons, with offspring who are half-human, 
half-demonic — or, as a struggle between Jews and Gentiles, where Jewish men are 
lured by Gentile women, and their offspring are half-Jewish, half-Gentile. In both cases 
the offspring are spumed by both sides. 

Lilith plays a major role in Jewish lore as the incarnation of lust. She haunts men in 
their dreams and imaginations. Every time a man had a sexual dream or fantasy, he 
was believed to have had intercourse with Lilith, and the product of this intercourse 
were mutant demons, half human and half demon, who were spurned by humans 
and by demons alike. The story recounted here is a famous 17th-century folktale from 
the ethical text Kav ha-Yashar. 



LILITH RISES FROM THE DEEP 221 


Among the oral traditions about a man's demon sons is that that when he lies on 
his deathbed, his demon sons surround him, crying out his name. So too are the de- 
mon sons said to accompany a man's human sons to the cemetery, where they mourn 
for him. To deceive the demons, his true sons do not take a direct path to the funeral, 
but set off in the opposite direction. Once they reach the cemetery, they read Psalm 91 
out loud, to ward off the demons. Then they form a sacred circle and dance around 
the dead man seven times. This prevents the demon sons from approaching the de- 
ceased and demanding their inheritance. 

Psalm 91 is the psalm used to ward off demons and is believed to invoke supernatu- 
ral protective qualities. It is recited to keep away the forces of evil. Especially important 
is the verse. He will order his angels to guard you wherever you go (Psalms 91:11). It also 
includes verses such as. You need not fear the terror of the night , or the arrow that flies by day , 
the plague that stalks in the darkness , or the scourge that rages at noon (Ps. 91:5-6). 

These folk traditions grow out of a belief in extreme sexual purity, where any acci- 
dental or intentional spilling of a man's seed is regarded as a sin, the sin of Onan (Gen. 
38:8-10). So too do they reflect the widespread belief — and fear — of succubi, in the 
form of Lilith and her daughters. For more on nocturnal emissions, see B. Berakhot 57b 
and B. Yevamot 76a.

266. LILITH, THE QUEEN OF ZEMARGAD 

Lilith, the Queen of Zemargad, has the form of a beautiful woman from the head to the 
navel, and from the navel down she is flaming fire. Her only intention is to arouse wars 
and all kinds of destruction. It was she who seized and killed the sons of Job. 

Her lovers include Samael and Ashmedai, the King of Demons. Indeed, great jealousy 
sprang up between the demons Samael and Ashmedai over Lilith. 

When God brings about the destruction of Rome, and turns it into a ruin for all eter- 
nity, He will send Lilith there, and let her dwell in that ruin, for she is the ruination of the 
world, as it is said. And Lilith shall repose there (Isa. 34:14). 

Just as the sirens in Greek mythology are destructive female creatures, half-woman 
and half-bird, so Lilith is described here as being half-woman, half-fire. This descrip- 
tion serves a dual purpose. On the one hand it shows that she is not a real woman, but 
some kind of strange creature, and the fire that makes up her lower half symbolizes 
the fires of desire that she awakens and that her role is directly related to lust. 

In Jewish folklore, Lilith is identified as the Queen of Demons and is said to be mar- 
ried to Ashmedai, the King of Demons. In this myth, where the view of Lilith is entirely 



222 MYTHS OF HELL 


negative, she is viewed as a destructive creature who provokes nothing but lust and 
jealousy. Even her demon lovers, Samael and Ashmedai, fight over her. But, the myth 
promises, the day will come when, like Rome, Lilith will receive her just punishment 
and be forced to live in a ruin, since she has ruined so many lives. See "The Two Liliths," 
following, for a variant myth.

Targum to Job 1:15; Kabbalot in Mada'ei ha-Yahadut 2:257; Zohar 3:19a. 


267. THE TWO LILITHS 

Some say there are two Liliths. One is the spouse of Samael and the other is the spouse of 
Ashmedai. On Yom Kippur the two Liliths go forth into the desert and screech. And 
when the two meet there, they quarrel in the desert, and they strive with each other until 
their voices rise up to heaven, and the earth shakes with their clamor. God sees that this 
takes place so that the two Liliths should not accuse Israel while Israel is at prayer on 
Yom Kippur. 

Kabbalistic texts identify two Liliths, one sometimes known as Grandmother Lilith 
the Great and the other as Little Lilith. Mythic speculation about two Liliths grows 
out of two separate traditions about Lilith, one linking her to the demon Samael, and 
the other linking her to Ashmedai, the King of Demons. One of Lilith's specialties is to 
distract men while they are at prayer with lascivious thoughts. Here God sees to it 
that Lilith cannot distract Israel on Yom Kippur by sending the two Liliths out into the 
desert, where they screech and struggle with each other. 

This myth of the two Liliths being sent out into the desert on Yom Kippur seems to 
be parallel to that of the scapegoat sent out into the desert to Azazel on Yom Kippur 
(Lev. 16:20-22). See "A Scapegoat for Azazel," p. 295. But it replaces the male demon of 
the biblical myth— Azazel— with a female demon, Lilith. And instead of the scapegoat 
being sent to Azazel, the two Liliths are sent out to quarrel and screech at each other, 
distracting them and thus preventing them from accusing the people of Israel on the 
Day of Atonement. See "The Ba'al Shem Tov Ascends on High," p. 209 for another ex- 
ample of the theme of silencing the Accuser. 

A parallel mythic development is found in the myth of the two Messiahs, Messiah 
ben Joseph and Messiah ben David. See "The Two Messiahs," p. 517.

268. LILITH'S CHILDREN 

In his travels, Rabbah bar Bar Hannah reached the city of Mehuza. There he saw Hurmin, 
the son of Lilith, running along the battlements of the walls of the city. A cavalryman was 
chasing him from below, but even though he was riding on horseback, he could not catch 
up with him. 

Once Hurmin had two mules saddled and stood them on two bridges of the Rognag 
River. As Rabbah watched, Hurmin jumped back and forth from one to the other, hold- 
ing two glasses of wine in his hand, pouring wine from one to the other, without spilling 
a drop. When the king of Mehuza heard about Hurmin's stunts, he had him executed, for 
the king feared that Hurmin would try to depose him. 

As for Lilith's daughters, they are just as dangerous as she is. Their names are Na'amah, 
Agrat, Irit, and the Queen of Sheba. 



LILITH RISES FROM THE DEEP 223 


Some say that Na'amah is Lilith's daughter, and some say that she is her sister. In any 
case, they are like evil twins, for they work in exactly the same way. They lure grooms 
into their web, and marry them not to their intended brides, but to their demonic doubles. 

Watch out for Agrat. She roams about in the company of eighteen myriads of angels of 
death, all of whom kill by strangulation. It is dangerous to go out on Wednesday night or 
the eve of the Sabbath because of them. 

As for the Queen of Sheba, she seeks out men to seduce, just like her mother. She comes 
to them whether awake or asleep and steals their seed and bears them demonic offspring. 

The accounts of Rabbah bar Bar Hannah take the form of tall tales, on land and sea. 

This one recounts how he reached the city of Mehuza and saw Hurmin, Lilith's son, 
performing stunts. Rabbah's tales are generally interpreted as allegories. Here Rabbi 
Samuel ben Meir (1083-1174), known as Rashbam, sees Hurmin as representing the 
Yetzer ha-Ra, the Evil Inclination. The cavalryman is the Tzaddik who makes a great 
effort to perform the mitzvot, the commandments. The juggling of the cups indicates 
that every misdeed against Israel will be duly punished. 

While Lilith is undoubtedly the primary Jewish demoness, there are several other 
demonesses who make their mark in Jewish lore, especially Na'amah, Agrat, and the 
Queen of Sheba. So it is not surprising that they are sometimes identified as the daugh- 
ters of Lilith. Their functions are virtually identical to those of Lilith: seducing men 
and leading them astray, and giving birth to demons, including mutant demons fa- 
thered by human men. See "Demonic Doubles," p. 230.

269 . THE NIGHT DEMONESS 

Using the power of God's Name, King Solomon compelled the demon Omasis to reveal 
the names of all the other demons. One of those he named was Obyzouth. No sooner did 
the demon pronounce her name than Solomon saw what seemed to be a woman, whose 
body and limbs were veiled by her long hair. 

Solomon said to her, "Who are you?" She replied, "Who are you, and why do you 
want to know who I am? But if you wish to know this, then go into the royal chambers, 
wash your hands, seat yourself on your throne again, and ask me. Then you will learn 
who I am." 

And after King Solomon had done these things, he asked her again who she was, and 
she replied: "Men call me Obyzouth. At night I go around the whole world and visit 
women about to give birth. As soon as the child is bom, I do my best to strangle it. If I fail, 
I leave at once and go somewhere else, because I cannot let a single night pass without 
success. I have nothing else to do but kill children." 

When King Solomon heard this, he said. "Tell me, evil spirit, how can women protect 
themselves from you? By the name of what angel are you rendered harmless?" Obyzouth 
said, "By the angel Apharoph. And when women give birth, they should write my name 
on a piece of paper and hang it up, and I will flee from that place." 

This description of the demoness Obyzouth from The Testament of Solomon (first 
through third centuries CE) contains the key elements of the Lilith myth. Both are noc- 
turnal demons who attempt to strangle newborn babies. Even their appearance is simi- 
lar, for they both have long, black hair. But the demoness Obyzouth disappears after The 
Testament of Solomon, and Lilith takes over her role, in an example of mythic absorption. 

Now Lilith has two roles, as the incarnation of lust and as a child-destroying witch. As 



224 MYTHS OF HELL 


evidence of the link between the two demonesses in later kabbalistic literature, Obyzouth 
was said to be one of the secret names of Lilith.

270. LILITH THE WITCH 

At night Lilith flies over homes until she smells the odor of mothers' milk. She finds a 
way to enter the house — any kind of crack in the door or window will do. She can take 
any form she desires, a black cat, a broom, even a hair in the milk. Some say she comes 
there to strangle the infant, others that she wants to steal the afterbirth, to feed it to her 
children. Only if the child is guarded by an amulet against Lilith will the child be safe. 

But Lilith's greatest enemy was the old midwife who was familiar with all her tricks. It 
is told that Lilith, flying over the house of a woman who had recently given birth, smelled 
the mother's milk and transformed herself into a long, black hair that fell into a glass of 
milk. When the mother was about to drink the milk, she noticed the black hair and fainted. 
The midwife recognized the presence of Lilith at once and poured the glass of milk, hair 
and all, into a jug, and closed it tightly. Shaking the jug, the midwife heard the pleas of 
Lilith from within and extracted a vow from her not only to spare the woman and her 
child, but also to serve them for three years and protect them from other evil forces. This 
Lilith did, for once she takes an oath, she is compelled to carry it out. 

Note that the portrait of Lilith in the story of the midwife is quite different from 
that found in the male myths. The male attitude toward Lilith mixes fear with sexual 
fantasy. From a woman's perspective, however, Lilith is bad news in every way, as 
Lilith threatens to steal both her husband's affection and seed and the very life of her 
children. (It is important to contrast this traditional view of Lilith as an evil demoness 
with the contemporary view, espoused by Jewish feminists, that Lilith be viewed as a 
role model for sexual and personal independence. See footnote 172 in the Introduc- 
tion.) Thus Lilith holds far more power over men than she does over women. Perhaps 
this is because men are ambivalent toward Lilith, seeing her as something forbidden 
and tempting, while fearing her destructive abilities. For women, Lilith is a husband- 
stealing, child-destroying witch they fear and loathe more than anything else. And 
unlike the men, they are willing to struggle against her, here defeating her. The story 
of the midwife who captures Lilith is Kurdish. Professor Dov Noy suggests that this is 
a prime example of a woman's tale, containing secrets of how to defeat the enemy, 

Lilith. See "The Hair in the Milk" in Lilith's Cave , pp. 110-112.

271. LILITH AND ELIJAH 

Elijah was walking one day when he met Lilith. He said, "Unclean one, where are you 
going?" Lilith knew that she could not lie to Elijah, so she said, "I am going to the house 
of a woman who is about to give birth. I will give her a sleeping potion and kill her and 
take her child and eat it." 



LILITH RISES FROM THE DEEP 225 


Elijah said, "I curse you in the Name of the Lord. Be silent as a stone!" 

Lilith said, "O lord, release me from your curse and I swear by God's Name to forsake 
my evil ways. As long as I hear or see my own names I will retreat and not come near that 
person. I shall have no power to injure him or do evil. I swear to disclose my true names 
to you." 

Elijah said, "Tell me what your names are." 

Lilith said, "These are my names: Lilith, Abiti, Abizu, Amrusu, Hakash, Ode, Ayil, 
Matruta, Avgu, Katah, Kali, Batub, and Paritasha." Let them be written and hung about 
the house of women who are bearing a child, or around the child after it has been bom. 
And when I see those names, I shall run away at once. Neither the child nor the mother 
will ever be injured by me." 

And Elijah said, "So be it. Amen." 

Here Lilith is portrayed not only as a witch intent on killing children, but as a 
cannibal as well, who seeks to kill the mother and devour the child. This is the vilest 
description of Lilith to be found anywhere. At the same time, Lilith is subject to the 
power of Elijah, who curses her in God's Name to be silent as stone. This would be a 
terrible punishment for Lilith, who uses her verbal wiles to bargain her way out of 
every difficult situation. Lilith then agrees to stay away from every pregnant woman 
or newborn child where Lilith's own names are posted in the house. This creates the 
kind of amulet against Lilith found in "A Spell to Banish Lilith," p. 218. Here, how- 
ever, is a different story of the origin of the amulet. The more famous account found in 
The Alpha Beta de-Ben Sira tells how God sent three angels to force Lilith to return to 
Adam, but when she refused, they agreed on the creation of an amulet that would 
ward off Lilith. See "Adam and Lilith," p. 216. 

Thus there are two important elements that differ from the usual folk traditions 
about Lilith: one is that she devoured her infant victims, and the other is about her 
encounter with Elijah having resulted in the creation of an amulet to ward her off. 

An unknown Gnostic tale is referred to by Epiphanius in Panarion, in which Elijah 
was said to have been cast back into the world after his ascent on high. A female 
demon took hold of him and said, "Where are you going? I have children from you, 
and you can't go to heaven and leave your children here." Elijah said, "How can you 
have children from me? I was always chaste." The demon said, "But I do! While you 
were dreaming, you often had an emission, and I took the seeds from you and begot 
you children." The existence of this story indicates that Elijah and Lilith, or a Lilith- 
like figure, were regarded as traditional adversaries, one deeply pious, the other, the 
embodiment of evil.

272. LILITH FLEES FROM THE APPARITION OF EVE 

When God created Adam, he attached Eve to Adam's back. Her beauty was like that of 
the realms above. Some say she was only an apparition, for she had not been brought 
into being, while others say that she was Adam's other half, until God separated them, 
creating two beings where there had been one. 

Once Lilith approached Adam, seeking to seduce him, for she thought that he was all 
alone. But when she saw Eve's perfect image attached to Adam's back, Lilith flew from 
there to the cherubim who guard the gates of the Garden of Eden. But the cherubim 
turned her away, and God dispatched her to the depths of Cities of the Sea. 



226 MYTHS OF HELL 


There Lilith dwelt until Adam and Eve sinned. Then God freed her from the watery 
depths and let her roam to and fro in the world. She returned to the cherubim and dwelt 
there by the fiery ever-turning sword that guards the way to the Tree of Life (Gen. 3:24). 

Some say that she still bides her time there until the moon is on the wane and the light 
diminishes. Then she comes forth from the gates of the Garden and flies through the 
world seeking revenge against the children of Eve. 

But others say that God has exiled her once again to the Cities of the Sea, and that she 
will remain there until Rome is destroyed. Then God will bring Lilith from the depths 
and settle her in Rome's desolate ruins. 

This myth is a good example of how the Zohar takes an existing midrash and trans- 
forms it into a kabbalistic one. The midrash on which this myth is based ( B . Eruv. 14a) 
describes Adam and Eve as having been created back to back. That image recurs here 
(Zohar 1:19b), but it seems to suggest that rather than being a flesh and blood creature. 

Eve is more of an apparition, a perfect image. This interpretation grows out of the 
verse In the image of God He created him , male and female He created them (Gen. 1:27). 
Tzelem, the word for "image," has many mystical meanings. Here it seems to suggest 
that Eve is more of an archetype than a person. Lilith is intimidated by this vision, 
either because she realizes that Adam is already with another woman, or because 
Eve's supernal beauty (which is, after all, that of the image of God) so greatly tran- 
scends her own. Gershom Scholem suggests that tzelem is a kind of astral body (On the 
Mystical Shape of the Godhead , pp. 251-273). 

Then the myth recounts that Lilith flees to the cherubim, who guard the gates of 
the Garden of Eden (Gen. 3:24). Her reasons for seeking out the cherubim are not 
clear, but it is possible that she, too, wanted a human body In any case, the cherubim 
guarding the gates of Eden turn her away and God imprisons her in the depths of the 
sea. But Adam's sin causes God to set her free, and she comes as close as she can to the 
Garden of Eden— still, it seems, desiring entry there— while using the night to seek 
harm against human infants, which, it is implied, is her revenge against Eve. 

Zohar 3:19a describes Eve as being fastened to Adam's side, rather than his back, at 
the time that God breathes the breath of life into him, and this living soul pervades his 
body. In both of these sources from the Zohar it seems that the female plays a role 
similar to that defined by Carl Jung as the anima, the feminine side of a man, whose 
presence must be discovered and integrated in order for a man to achieve wholeness. 
Eventually, however, God splits Adam and prepares Eve as an independent person 
(Zohar 3:19a). Here "prepares" can be understood as transforming Eve from her image 
into a living person, or, more closely following the midrashim about the wedding of 
Adam and Eve, preparing her as a bride for Adam. Or both, for this same passage 
from the Zohar also states that the reason Lilith fled was that she saw God bringing 
Eve to Adam, dressed as a bride (Gen. 2:22). 

Kabbalistic cosmology offers an entirely different way of viewing this myth of Lilith 
and Eve. Here Lilith represents not a demoness, but the whole side of evil in the Sitra 
Ahra, "the Other Side," the domain of dark emanations and demonic power. Eve, like- 
wise represents the world of holiness. See "Adam the Hermaphrodite," p. 138, and 
"The First Wedding," p. 143.

VAMPIRES/ SPIRITS/ DYBBUKS, AND DEMONS 227 


273. THE SPIRITS OF THE SIXTH DAY 

God created all day long during the first six days of Creation and did not rest until the 
sun set on the sixth day. But when the Sabbath day was ready to be sanctified, there were 
still spirits that had been created who were left without a body. Thus their creation was 
incomplete, and they are blemished. The holy name does not dwell in them. That is why 
demons have no bodies, but are composed entirely of spirit. 

Some of these evil spirits tried to enter the body of Adam after God shaped him into 
the form of a human being, but before God breathed the breath of life into him. 

These spirits continue to exist in the realm of spirits, whirlwinds, and demons known 
as the Sitre Ahra , the Other Side. They are made corporeal in that realm, the realm of Cain. 

It is said that these spirits have three things in common with the angels, and three things 
in common with men. Like angels, they have wings, they fly from one end of the world to 
the other, and they know the future, for they hear it spoken from behind the heavenly 
curtain ( Pargod ). Like humans, they eat and drink, they propagate, and they die. 

Likewise, in three ways demons are like human beings, and in three ways they are like 
the angels. Like humans they eat and drink, reproduce and multiply, and die. In addi- 
tion, they are said to have the feet of cocks, they can change their appearance any time 
they please, and they see, but they cannot be seen. 

If you want to discover demons, take sifted ashes and sprinkle them around your bed, 
and in the morning you will see something like the footprints of a cock. If you want to see 
them, take the afterbirth of a black she-cat, the firstborn of a firstborn, roast it in fire and 
grind it to powder, and then put some in your eye and you will see them. 

This is a myth about the origin of evil spirits, which are said to have been created 
during the six days of creation with the intention of pairing them with bodies, but 
when the sun set on the sixth day of creation, there were many spirits left without 
bodies. These spirits are linked with the Sitra Ahra, the Other Side. They are regarded 
as unclean, and dwell in the realm of evil, or wander restlessly around the world. See 
"Adam and the Spirits," p. 140.

274. THE VAMPIRE DEMON 

The demons did not want to see the Temple built. They could not harm King Solomon, or 
the chief builder, so Omasis, a vampire demon, approached the chief builder's son and 
sucked blood from his thumb. He did this many times, until the boy was very weak. King 
Solomon noticed his condition, and asked him what was wrong. When the boy told the 
king, Solomon gave the boy his royal ring, with the letters of God's Name, YHVH, en- 
graved on it, and told the boy to throw the ring at the demon the next time he approached. 
That would make him the boy's prisoner. When that happened, the boy was to bring him 
to King Solomon. 

That is exactly how things came to pass, and before long King Solomon besieged Omasis 
with many questions about the other demons, what their names were, and how they 
could be stopped. In this way. King Solomon extracted the names of all the demons. And 
with the knowledge he gained, Solomon saw the building of the Temple completed, and 
held off the demons throughout the years he ruled, for they had no power over him. 

This is the earliest Jewish vampire tale, as well as one of the few such tales to be 
found in Jewish lore. This tale of the demon Omasis serves as the frame tale to The 



228 MYTH) OF HELL 


Testament of Solomon, a pseudepigraphal text believed to date from before the writing 
down of the Talmud. The conventional vampire/host relationship is presented quite 
clearly in the role of the demon and the boy who is his victim. King Solomon's plan to 
capture the vampire demon is similar to that used to capture Ashmedai king of de- 
mons, in B. Gittin 68. 

Sefer Hasidim (twelfth century) includes a tale about Astryiah the vampire, who 
sucks the blood from her victims while they are asleep.

275. AN EVIL DEMONESS 

One after the other. King Solomon invoked a host of demons and evil spirits, in order to 
find out their names and how they might be thwarted. Among them was a demoness 
whose name was Onoskelis. Her torso was that of a beautiful woman, but her legs were 
those of a mule. 

Solomon said, "Tell me who you are." She replied, "I am Onoskelis, a spirit that has 
been made into a body. I was created by the echo of a voice from a black heaven. I make 
my home in caves in the sides of cliffs and ravines. I travel by the moon. Sometimes I 
strangle men, sometimes I pervert them from their true nature, for men think of me as a 
woman, which I am not. Men worship me secretly and openly and this incites me to be 
an evildoer all the more." 

Then King Solomon uttered God's name and commanded her to spin hemp for the 
ropes used to build the Temple in Jerusalem. He had her bound in a such a way that she 
was powerless, so that she had to stand day and night to spin the hemp. 


The Testament of Solomon serves as a comprehensive listing of demons and spirits. 
King Solomon invokes and then interrogates them. Here he invokes the spirit of an 
evil demoness, Onoskelis, who seduces and strangles men. She is a Lilith-like figure, 
but there are some distinct differences. While Lilith demonstrates seductive beauty 
entirely, Onoskelis has a beautiful torso but the legs of a mule. Like Lilith, she de- 
ceives men into believing she is a woman, when she is actually a demoness set on 
their destruction. Solomon's punishment for her is like that of a fairy tale— she must 
endlessly spin hemp. This, of course, keeps her occupied, and forces her to contribute 
to the building of the Temple.

276. THE WIDOW OF SAFED 

A widow living in Safed, whom everyone considered pious, suddenly began to speak 
with the voice of a man, until it became apparent that a wandering spirit, a dybbuk, had 
taken possession of her body. The woman was greatly tormented by this spirit, and she 
sought help among the disciples of Rabbi Isaac Luria, known as the Ari. Rabbi Joseph 
Arsin was the first to visit her, and when the voice addressed him by name, he was amazed. 
Then the dybbuk revealed that he had once been a pupil of Rabbi Arsin's when they had 
both lived in Egypt, and he gave his name. Rabbi Arsin recalled that he had once had 
such a pupil and realized that the former pupil's soul was now addressing him. 

Rabbi Arsin demanded to know why the soul of this man had taken possession of the 
pious widow. The dybbuk readily confessed that he had committed a grievous sin. He 



VAMPIRES# SPIRITS# DYBBUKS# AND DEMONS 229 


had caused a woman to break her marriage vow and had fathered a child with her. And 
because of this sin, he had been enslaved after his death by three angels, who had dragged 
him by a heavy chain and had punished him endlessly. He had taken possession of the 
widow's body in order to escape this terrible punishment. 

Then Rabbi Arsin asked the dybbuk to describe the circumstances of his death, and the 
spirit said: "I lost my life when the ship on which I was sailing sank. Nor was I able to 
confess my sins before dying, because it happened so quickly. When the news of the 
wreck reached the closest town, my body was recovered along with the others who had 
drowned, and I was buried in a Jewish cemetery. But as soon as the mourners left, an evil 
angel opened the grave with a fiery rod and led me to the gates of Gehenna. But the angel 
guarding Gehenna refused to allow me to enter, so great was my sin, and instead I was 
condemned to wander, pursued by three avenging angels. 

"Twice before I tried to escape from this endless punishment. Once I took possession 
of a rabbi, but he invoked a flock of impure spirits, and in order to escape them I had to 
abandon his body. Later I became so desperate that I took possession of the body of a 
dog, which became so crazed that it ran until it dropped dead. Then I fled to Safed and 
entered the body of this woman." 

Rabbi Arsin then commanded the dybbuk to depart from the widow's body but the 
dybbuk refused. So Rabbi Arsin went to the Ari and asked him to perform the exorcism. 
The Ari called upon his disciple. Rabbi Hayim Vital, to do this in his name and gave him 
a formula, consisting of holy names, that would force the dybbuk to depart. 

Now when Rabbi Hayim Vital entered the house of the poor widow, the dybbuk forced 
her to turn her back to him. And when Hayim Vital asked the dybbuk to explain this, the 
spirit said that he could not bear the holy countenance of his face. Then Hayim Vital 
asked the dybbuk to tell him how long it had been cursed to wander. The spirit replied 
that its wandering would last until the child he had fathered had died. Finally, Hayim 
Vital asked to know how the dybbuk was able to enter the body of the widow. The dybbuk 
explained that the woman had made it possible because she had little faith, since she did 
not believe that the waters of the Red Sea had truly parted. 

Hayim Vital asked the woman if this was true, and she insisted that she did believe in 
the miracle. He made her repeat her belief three times, and on the third time Hayim Vital 
uttered the formula that the Ari had taught him. After that he commanded the dybbuk to 
depart from the woman by the little toe of her left foot. At that moment the dybbuk did 
depart with a terrible cry, and the woman was freed from the agony of that possession. 
The next day, when the Ari ordered that the mezuzzah on her door be checked, it was 
found to be empty, and that is why it did not protect against that evil spirit. 

The legends concerning Dybbuks, spirits of the dead who take possession of the liv- 
ing, multiply in the later medieval and Hasidic literature. There are scores of such ac- 
counts of possession in Jewish lore. "The Widow of Safed" records the history of one 
such case, revealing, in the process, the basic pattern to which all possessions are sub- 
jected. The dybbuk has been able to enter the house because the mezuzzah is defective and 
has been able to take possession of the woman because of her lack of faith in the miracle 
of the crossing of the Red Sea. The latter was the standard test of true faith among Jews. 

Note that the Ari sends Hayim Vital to perform the exorcism in this tale, imputing to 
him powers similar to those of his master. Another early account of possession by a 
dybbuk is found in Ma'aseh Buch 152, also dating from the sixteenth century, suggesting 
that the superstitious conditions both in Eastern Europe and the Middle East were right 
for this belief. Earlier cases of possession did not involve spirits of the dead, but rather 
demonic possession, as recorded in Josephus ( Antiquities , 8:2.5) and the Talmud (B. Me'ilah 
17b). It is interesting to note that the majority of these accounts of possession include 



230 MYTHS OF HELL 


details of name and place that far exceed the usual anonymity of folklore. Gedalyiah 
Nigal has compiled a Hebrew anthology of dybbuk tales, Sippurei ha-Dybbuk (Jerusalem: 
1983), and virtually every account includes the place and year where the possession and 
exorcism occurred and the names of the witnesses. The tales almost always follow the 
same pattern: (1) Someone becomes possessed by a dybbuk. (2) A rabbi confronts the 
spirit and demands that it reveal its name and history. (3) The dybbuk tells its tale. (4) The 
dybbuk is then exorcised, and the one who was possessed recovers. This suggests that 
the pattern established in the earliest of these tales, such as this one, was repeated in 
succeeding generations and became, in effect, a socially recognized form of madness. 
More recently, such possession has been identified primarily as a psychological aberra- 
tion. In Legends of the Hasidim, the editor, Jerome Mintz, reports a case of such possession 
in which the Satmar Rebbe supposedly advised someone said to be possessed by a dybbuk 
to see a good psychiatrist (pp. 411-412).

277 . DEMONIC DOUBLES 

The kingdom of Satan is measure for measure like the kingdom of man. Every male 
child, when bom, already has a double in the kingdom of demons. So too does every 
female, when she is bom, have her shadow bom there as well, in her precise shape and 
image, not unlike that seen in a mirror. And at the hour that a heavenly voice goes forth 
to announce that this one will be married to that one, a partner is also prepared at the 
same time in the spirit world. She sits and waits for him there from that time forward. 
And the man who is fortunate marries his partner from the family of man, but less fortu- 
nate is he who is found alone on the fourth night of the week or on the night of the 
Sabbath. For then he is in danger of being kidnapped by the sons of Satan, and led to a 
place that no man's feet should ever enter, there to marry, not his intended, but his 
intended's demonic double. 

The Talmud explains that "Forty days before a person is born, a heavenly voice 
goes forth to say that this one will be married to that one" (B. Sota 2a). This knowledge 
is available to the angels, but not only to the angels — the demons, too, overhear this 
voice and make evil use of the knowledge they obtain. Thus, in effect, the bashert 
tradition, where a person seeks out and marries his or her "destined one," has been 
corrupted and effectively reversed by demons. 

In The Testament of Solomon King Solomon forces the demon Ornasis to explain how 
demons are familiar with future events. Ornasis tells him that "We demons go up to 
the firmament of heaven, fly around among the stars, and hear the decisions that 
issue from God concerning the lives of men." This explains how the demons, as well 
as the angels, hear the heavenly voice that announces future events. Using future 
knowledge, demons create the demonic double of a person's bashert and trick people 
into marrying their demonic doubles. This serves to explain the many strange mar- 
riages that are found in the world.

278. THE UNDERWORLD 

There is a great and high mountain where the spirits of the dead assemble, in the place 
known as Sheol. There the spirits of the righteous are separated from the those of the 
sinners, where they will remain until the day of judgment. 

Meanwhile, the voices of the spirits of those who have died go forth from there to 
heaven, pleading for mercy. One of those spirits belongs to Abel, slain by his brother 
Cain, and he still makes his case against the seed of Cain, till they are annihilated from 
the face of the earth. 


This myth from 1 Enoch , dating from around the second century bce to the first 
century ce, identifies the place of the dead as Sheol, as does the Bible. Later Sheol is 
replaced by Gehenna, Jewish hell, where the souls of the dead are punished and puri- 
fied. This myth demonstrates that even after death the spirits of those who have been 
murdered continue to plead their case against their murderers. This belief can be traced 
to the verse Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground (Gen. 4:10), confirming 
the belief that such terrible deeds can never go unpunished. Also standing behind this 
myth is the concept of the seed of Abel and the seed of Cain. These are the descen- 
dants of Cain and Abel (or, in Abel's case, the descendants of Seth since Abel had no 
descendents that we know of), in whose blood the conflict is carried on. And the spirit 
of Abel will not be satisfied until all of the descendants of Cain— traditionally identi- 
fied as the enemies of the Jews — will be annihilated.

279. WHEN A MAN DIES 

Two angels watch over a man at the moment of his death, and they know whether he has 
ever been a thief, for even the stones and beams of his house witness against him, as it is said. 
For a stone shall cry out from the wall , and a rafter shall answer it from the woodwork (Hab. 2:11). 

Then the soul of the man who has died is brought before the patriarchs and they say to 
him, "My son, what have you done in the world from which you have come?" 

If he answers, "I have bought fields and vineyards, and I have tilled them all my life," 
they say, "Fool that you have been! Have you not learned that The earth is the Lord's and all 
that it holds" (Ps. 24:1). Angels then take him away and hand him over to the avenging 
angels, who thrust him into Gehenna. 

Then angels bring another before the patriarchs. They ask the same question, and if he 
answers, "I gathered gold and silver," they reply, "Fool, have you not read in the books of 
the prophets, Silver is Mine and gold is Mine— says the Lord of Hosts (Hag. 2:8). Likewise, he 
is turned over to the avenging angels. 

But when a scholar is brought before them, they ask the same question, and if he 
answers, "I have devoted my life to the study of the Law," the patriarchs say, "Let him 
enter into peace" (Isa. 57:2), and God receives him with grace. 

This account of what happens to those who die emphasizes the importance of the 
study of Torah in the eyes of the patriarchs, who are said to serve as judges, and in the 
eyes of God. The two angels who watch over a man at the time of his death are iden- 
tified as the Angel of Death and the Angel who counts a man's days and years.

280. THE CREATION OF GEHENNA 

Gehenna, the place of punishment, was one of the seven things created before the Cre- 
ation, but for a long time it was nothing more than a great void. Then, at the time that 
God separated Himself from Adam and ascended on high, God lit the fires of Gehenna, 
and made them alternate with periods where everything is covered by ice. 

This myth links the lighting of the fires of Gehenna to the exile of Adam from Eden. 

This implies that Adam's sin created the need for the fires to be lit. Thus, while Gehenna 
may have been created before the creation, it was only initiated as a place of punish- 
ment after the Fall. 

Not all myths about the nature of Gehenna are consistent. Some describe it solely 
as a place of terrible fires, but other versions have it alternate periods of great heat 
with periods of the deepest cold.

281. THE PRINCE OF GEHENNA 

Before the souls of the wicked are taken to the netherworld, Arsiel, the Prince of Gehenna, 
waits for God's order to take them there. Meanwhile, the Prince of Gehenna stands be- 
fore the righteous, saying, " Give me the souls " (Gen. 14:21). In this way he does his best to 
distract the righteous, so that they will not pray for the wicked. For the Prince of Gehenna 
knows only too well the power of their prayers. 

Several figures are identified as the Prince of Gehenna — the angel in charge of the 
souls of the wicked, who are being punished in Gehenna. Among them, Satan is the best 
known angel, along with Samael. The demon Ashmedai is said to rule the Kingdom of 
Demons. The Prince of Darkness is another name that is used. Here the Prince of Gehenna 
is identified as the angel Arsiel, who plays the satanic role of confronting the souls of 
the righteous to distract them from praying for the souls of the wicked. Then, when God 
gives the order, he takes them down to Gehenna. Note that God is at the head of the 
chain of the orders that send the wicked to the netherworld. All that remains to save the 
wicked from their fate are the prayers of the righteous. But they are a potent force. For 
more on the efficacy of the prayers of the righteous, see "The Ashes of Sinners," p. 242.

282. THE HISTORY OF GEHENNA 

Where is Gehenna? Some say it is above the firmament, others that it lies below the earth. 
Still others say that it lies behind the Mountains of Darkness. How big is it? As big as the 
Garden of Eden, and that is said to be boundless. 

Some say that Gehenna predates the creation of the universe. Others say that the space 
for Gehenna was created first, but its fires did not begin to bum until the eve of the first 
Sabbath. Still others say that the fires of Gehenna were created on the second day, while 
ordinary fire was not created until after the end of the Sabbath. So powerful are the fires 
of Gehenna that they make the sun red in the evening, as it passes over them. It is said 
that those fires will never be extinguished. 

But the fires of Gehenna are not the only punishment, for Gehenna is half fire and half 
hail. The fires of Gehenna are bad enough, but the hail is much worse. 



THE HISTORY OF 6EHENNA 233 


Gehenna is the place of punishment in Jewish lore, the Jewish equivalent of hell. It 
has much in common with the Christian concept of hell, except that in the Jewish 
view punishment in Gehenna never lasts more than a year, while in the Christian 
view it is eternal. It is usually described as being under the earth — when the earth 
opened and swallowed Korah, he and his followers fell into the fires of Gehenna. 

But there is also a tradition that heaven and Gehenna exist side by side, and that 
the wall separating them is no more than a hand's breadth. 

The concept of Gehenna grew out of the Valley of Gehinnom in Jerusalem, which 
was regarded as a place of evil, as children were once sacrificed in pagan ceremonies 
there.

283. THE OPENINGS OF GEHENNA 

Some say that there are three entrances to Gehenna, one in the wilderness, one in the sea, 
and a third in Jerusalem. Others say that there are two date trees in the valley of Gehinnom 
where smoke ascends, and that is the entrance to Gehenna. Others say that there are four 
openings to Gehenna on each side of the universe, sixteen in all. Whatever direction the 
wicked may take in trying to escape Gehenna, they only run into another of its openings. 
Still others say there are fifty gates to Gehenna, each of which has holes in which the feet 
of the wicked are locked. 

Then there are those who say that the mouth of Gehenna can be found anywhere in the 
world, and should it be needed, the mouth opens and swallows whatever is standing there. 

Various sources describe different entrances to Gehenna, and this myth attempts to 
resolve the contradictions by stating that Gehenna has three entrances. An alternate 
explanation suggests that the entrance to Gehenna can be found anywhere, and that the 
ground can open up and swallow a sinner, just as it did for Korah and his followers 
when they challenged Moses in Numbers 16:32. See "The Punishment of Korah," p. 235. 

See too "The Door to Gehenna," p. 240.

284. THE LANDSCAPE OF GEHENNA 

Some say that there are coals in Gehenna as big as mountains and as huge as the Dead 
Sea. So too are there rivers of pitch and sulphur flowing and fuming and seething through- 
out Gehenna. 

Others say that Gehenna is half fire and half ice, and when the sinners escape from the 
fire, they are tortured by the ice, and when they escape from the ice, the fire bums them. 



234 MYTHS OF HELL 


In many ways Gehenna is a distorted mirror image of Paradise. Just as there are 
rivers of balsam flowing through heaven, there are rivers of pitch and sulphur flow- 
ing in Gehenna. The rivers of balsam are part of the rewards of paradise, while the 
rivers of pitch and sulphur are part of the punishments of Gehenna. 

So too is Gehenna sometimes described as half fire, half ice. Those being punished 
by the fire try to escape to the ice, but it is so terrible that they run back to the fire, for 
there is no escape from the punishments of Gehenna.

Orhot Hayim; Baraita de-Masekhet Gehinnom in Hesed le-Avraham; Midrash Konen in Beit 
ha-Midrash 2:24-39. 


285. THE SCORPIONS OF GEHENNA 

There are seven thousand scorpions in every crevice of Gehenna. Every scorpion has 
seventy thousand pouches of venom, and from these flow six rivers of deadly poison. 
When a man comes in contact with that poison, he immediately bursts, and his body is 
cleft asunder, and he falls dead on his face. Then the avenging angels collect his limbs 
and revive him and place him on his feet and take their revenge on him all over again. 

These deadly scorpions, far more lethal than any found on earth, are one more 
example of the kinds of punishments of Gehenna, where a sinner can be killed and 
revived over and over again, so that his suffering continues until his time in Gehenna 
comes to an end. 

Sources: 

Baraita de-Masekhet Gehinnom in Hesed le-Avraham. 


286. THE BRIDGE OVER GEHENNA 

There is a bridge that spans Gehenna. The spirits of the dead have to struggle to cross 
that bridge. When they are directly over Gehenna, the bridge appears to be no wider 
than a thread, and some of them lose their balance and tumble into Gehenna, their di- 
minishing screams following them into the abyss. 

The tortures of Gehenna are myriad, and nothing is as it seems. Here the spirits of 
the dead are forced to cross a bridge that seems to be as narrow as a thread and, losing 
their balance, they fall into the Abyss. The point is that those who receive punish- 
ments in Gehenna have nothing they can depend on, and live in constant danger. In a 
metaphorical sense, the bridge across Gehenna symbolizes the immense difficulty of 
sinners finding their way out of the punishments of Gehenna.

287. THE DARKNESS OF GEHENNA 

The darkness of Gehenna is thick as the wall of a city. Nothing is more terrible than this 
darkness, as it is said, A land whose light is darkness , all gloom and disarray , whose light is like 
darkness (Job 10:22). This is the darkness of the plague of darkness, when Moses held out 



THE HISTORY OF 6EHENNA 235 


his arm toward the sky and thick darkness descended (Exod. 10:22). Where did that darkness 
come from? From the darkness of Gehenna. 

One of the punishments of Gehenna is a terrible darkness as thick as a wall. In- 
deed, it was this impenetrable darkness that God drew upon when he brought the 
plague of darkness to Egypt. Once again, the punishment is intended to fit the crime. 

Just as the sinners were blind to their sins, so they are punished in Gehenna by a 
darkness so thick it leaves them lost in blindness.

288. THE LIGHT OF GEHENNA 

Sometimes a light issues forth from Gehenna into the Garden of Eden. This is a sign that 
God has accepted the grief of one of the souls that is being punished. The soul's contrition 
warrants its entry into the Garden of Eden, where its suffering is transformed into delight. 

This myth is in direct contrast to "The Darkness of Gehenna." It shows that God 
continues to monitor the grief of the sinners in Gehenna, and that He is prepared at a 
moment's notice to accept deeply felt repentance to free those sinners from the punish- 
ments of Gehenna. In contrasting Gehenna with the Christian concept of hell, it is im- 
portant to note that the punishments of hell are supposed to last forever, while the time 
the soul of a sinner spends being punished in Gehenna is limited to a maximum of 
twelve months. And ultimately, when the Messiah comes, Gehenna will cease to exist.

289. THE PUNISHMENT OF KORAH 

Once a Bedouin came to Rabbah bar Bar Hannah and offered to show him where Korah 
and his followers had been swallowed up by the earth. They went there and they saw 
two cracks in the ground, with smoke coming out of them. Rabbah took a bundle of wool 
and soaked it in water and put it on the tip of a spear. He then stuck the spear into one of 
the cracks in the earth. When he took it out, they saw that the wool was scorched by fire. 
The Bedouin told Rabbah to put his ear to the ground, to hear what Korah and his follow- 
ers were saying. When Rabbah did, he heard them crying out, "Moses and the Torah are 
true, and we were liars!" The Bedouin told Rabbah that every thirty days the angel ap- 
pointed over the sinners of hell brings them to this place, where they are roasted by the 
fire. And all the while they cry out in regret over what they have done. 

This is one of the tall tales attributed to Rabbah bar Bar Hannah found in the Tal- 
mud. Here a Bedouin takes him to the place where Korah and his followers were 
swallowed up by the earth after they rebelled against Moses in Numbers 16:32. The 
place they fall into is Gehenna, where evil souls are punished. Once a month Gehenna 
returns to that place. This regularity echoes Rabbah's tale about the same Bedouin 
leading him to the Wheel of Heaven, which returns to the same place every 24 hours. 

The moral of this myth is quite apparent: Korah and his followers are still crying 
out in regret for their rebellion against Moses, which will haunt them forever. See 
"Where Heaven and Earth Meet," p. 121 and "The Dead of the Desert," p. 471.

236 MYTHS OF HELL 


290. THE INHABITANTS OF GEHENNA 

The souls of the wicked descend below to Gehenna, as it is said. The spirit of the beast goes 
downward to the earth (Eccles. 3:21). This includes the utterly wicked in Israel and the 
wicked among the nations of the earth. Both will go down to Gehenna, as it is said. The 
wind shall carry them off, and the whirlwind shall scatter them (Isa. 41:16). 

This myth answers the question of whether the punishments of Gehenna are lim- 
ited to Jews, or whether they apply to the wicked of other nations. Here both are 
described as being punished in Gehenna. 

Sources: 

Ecclesiastes Rabbah on Ecclesiastes 3:21; Eliyahu Kabbah 18:108-109; Eliyahu Zuta 11:192. 


291. THE FATE OF THE SOUL 

The souls of the righteous are stored beneath the Throne of Glory, while the souls of the 
wicked are made to wander, and one angel stands at one end of the world and another at 
the other end, and they throw the wicked souls to one another, as it is said. He shall sling 
away the lives of your enemies as from the hollow of a sling (1 Sam. 25:29). 

This brief myth presents a stark contrast between the fates of the souls of the righ- 
teous and those of the wicked. While those of the righteous are kept close by, beneath 
God's throne, those of the wicked experience the punishment of wandering and exile, 
traditionally the worst possible punishment. This is the same punishment Cain re- 
ceives when God makes him a ceaseless wanderer on earth (Gen. 4:11). But most startling 
is the image of the angels standing at each end of the world, throwing the souls of the 
wicked back and forth. This emphasizes how relentless is the wandering they are 
condemned to, which takes on characteristics of one of the punishments of Gehenna, 
Jewish hell. See "The Punishments of Gehenna," following.

B. Shabbat 152b. 


292. THE PUNISHMENTS OF GEHENNA 

Gehenna, where the souls of the wicked are punished, is ruled by the angel Dumah. 
Dumah was appointed to rule over the netherworld. Three angels of destruction are at 
his command. Their names are Mashit, Af, and Hema, and they command many legions 
of avenging angels. All of Gehenna is filled with their din, and their shouts reach into 
heaven. That is why the voices of the wicked can barely be heard as they shriek out, and 
why no one has mercy upon them. 

Every night, except the Sabbath, the angels of destruction punish those whose evil 
deeds were hatched in the dark. There the wicked learn firsthand why the dread of 
Gehenna is so great. 

But when the Sabbath begins, judgment vanishes from the world and the wicked in 
Gehenna rest. The angels of destruction cease ruling over them from the moment the 
Sabbath arrives, until the Sabbath comes to an end. Then the wicked are dragged back to 
the dungeons of Gehenna, where their punishment resumes. 

It is said that in the future all the people of Israel will enter Gehenna together with the 
nations of the world, and the latter will all perish, while Israel will depart from its midst 
unharmed, as it is said. When you walk through fire, you shall not be scorched; through flame, it 
shall not bum you (Isa. 43:2). 



THE HISTORY OF 6EHENNA 23 7 


This myth explains how Gehenna is ruled by the angel Dumah. ( Dumah is the He- 
brew word for silence and land of death.). Dumah, in turn, commands three forces of 
angels of destruction, led by three angels, Mashit, Af, and Hema. The myth is offered 
by way of explanation as to why the phrase "He, in His compassion" is not said on the 
Sabbath, lest the angels of destruction be stirred up. Nor is it necessary to conclude 
the Hashkivenu with the blessing "He who protects his people Israel," because there is 
no need for protection — the Sabbath itself protects. Instead the blessing used is "He 
who spreads over us a Tabernacle of Peace," which is clearly understood to be a refer- 
ence to the Sabbath. 

The myth also emphasizes that even the wicked in Gehenna are freed from their 
punishments on the Sabbath, which is thus celebrated not only on earth, but also in 
heaven by God and the angels (see "God Keeps the Sabbath," p. 314) and even by the 
wicked being punished in hell. 

A few key prooftexts are brought in to substantiate this myth. Concerning those 
who plot evil in the dark, it is said. Who do their work in dark places (Isa. 29:15). The 
dread of Gehenna is said to be referred to in the verse Because of terror by night (S. of S. 
3:8). The names of the three commanding angels under Dumah are taken from this 
verse. Rabbi Alexander explained, "The dread of Gehenna is similar to the dread of 
night" (B. Sanh. 7b). 

Sefer Hasidim reports a man riding through the desert who saw by the light of the 
moon a line of wagons pulled by human beings. He recognized them as people who 
had died. He asked what they were doing, and they told him that it was the punish- 
ment for their sins. For if a person behaved like an animal during his lifetime, he was 
put to work like an animal in the afterlife.

• 293. THE FATE OF SLANDERERS 

What is the fate of slanderers? When slander, spread about the earth, mounts even to the 
throne of glory, destroying angels descend at God's command and seize the slanderers 
and throw them into the furnace of Gehenna. 

But Gehenna objects, saying, "The tongue of a slanderer reaches from earth up to the 
heavens. The entire world cannot stand him. First send your arrows at him, and then I 
will receive him, as it is said, A warrior's sharp arrows , with hot coals of broom-wood (Ps. 
120:4)." Then those who slander are hung by their tongues and subject to all the tortures 
that Gehenna has to offer. 

The most despicable figures in Gehenna are the slanderers. Not even Gehenna, 
personified here, can bear their presence. So Gehenna insists that God punish them 
first, and then Gehenna will receive them, according to the verse A warrior's sharp 
arrows , with hot coals of broom-wood (Ps. 120:4). Here the "coals of broom-wood" refers 
to the punishments of Gehenna. For another example of the personification of Gehenna, 
see "Gehenna Seething," p. 238. 

Note that the sinners are cast into the furnace of Gehenna, where the hottest flames 
of Gehenna are burning. This is to demonstrate the seriousness of their sins.

238 MYTHS OF HELL 


294. SABBATH IN GEHENNA 

Even the wicked in Gehenna enjoy a respite on the Sabbath. Every Sabbath eve, when 
the day becomes sanctified, the angel in charge of souls announces, "Let the punishment 
of the sinners cease, for the Holy King approaches and the Day is about to be sanctified. 
He protects all!" Instantly all punishment ceases, and the guilty have a respite. The sin- 
ners who observed the Sabbath are led to two mountains of snow, where they remain 
until the end of the Sabbath, when the angel in charge of the spirits shouts, "All evildo- 
ers, back to Gehenna — the Sabbath is over!" and they are thrust back to their former 
place in hell. Some of them, however, take snow with them to cool them during the six 
days of the week, but God says to them: "Woe to you who steal even in hell!" 

But the fires of Gehenna do not come to a halt for those who never observed the Sab- 
bath. Since they did not observe the Sabbath before, they have no respite. An angel whose 
name is Santriel, which means "God is my Guardsman," goes and fetches the body of the 
sinner from the grave. He brings it to Gehenna before the eyes of the guilty, and they see 
how it has bred worms. They know the soul of such a sinner has no respite from the fire 
of Gehenna. And all those guilty who are there surround that body and proclaim over it: 
"This person is guilty, for he would not regard the honor of his Master, he denied the 
Holy One, blessed be He, and denied the Torah. Woe to him! It had been better for him 
never to be created and not to be subjected to this punishment and this disgrace!" 

Rabbi Yehudah said: "After the Sabbath goes out the angel comes and takes that body 
back to its grave, and both the body and the soul are punished, each in its own way." 

And all this takes place while the body is still well preserved. But once the body is 
decayed, it no longer suffers all these punishments. The guilty ones are punished in their 
bodies and their souls, each with a suitable punishment, so long as the body in the grave 
is intact. But when the body breaks down the punishment of the soul ceases. He who 
must leave Gehenna leaves, and he who must find rest has rest — to each is done what is 
suitable for him. 

So great is the redeeming power of the Sabbath, that even the souls being punished 
in Gehenna are allowed to rest on the Sabbath, until the close of the Sabbath. As Tola'at 
Ya'akov puts it, " Din — harsh justice — is banished on the eve of the Sabbath, even from 
the sinners in Gehenna. For the Sabbath protects the cosmos. But on Saturday night 
Din is restored to its station. A herald cries out: ' Let the wicked be in SheoY " (Ps. 9:18). In 
addition to a reprieve on the Sabbath, Zohar 2:150b lists further reprieves on new moons 
and festivals. 

For a folktale about Sabbath in Gehenna, see "Three Stars" in Gabriels Palace , pp. 
227-228. See also "Sabbath in Gehenna" by Isaac Bashevis Singer's in The Death of 
Methuselah and Other Stories , pp. 212-219.

295. GEHENNA SEETHING 

Gehenna is seething all the time. God asked, "Why are you seething?" 

Gehenna replied, "I am seething, quivering with anger, shaking because of the vile 
things the wicked say about Israel." 

God asked, "What will it take to calm you?" 

Gehenna answered, "Cram me full of those who transgress against Israel." 



THE HISTORY OF 6EHENNA 239 


God said, "I have already filled you with the nations of the earth, and there is no more 
room in you." 

Gehenna replied, "Master of the Universe, did You not promise that Gehenna would 
be increased in height by so many parasangs in order to accommodate all transgres- 
sors?" 

At that instant Gehenna was expanded, and God still flings Israel's transgressors into it. 

This myth continues the personification of Gehenna seen in "The Fate of Slander- 
ers," p. 237, both from Eliyahu Rabbah. Thus Gehenna is not only portrayed here as a 
place of punishment, but also as a being gripped by the most intense anger, like a 
seething pot. God recognizes that Gehenna is seething, and inquires if there is a way 
to calm it. Gehenna demands to be crammed full of those who transgress against 
Israel. God raises the question of whether Gehenna has enough room to hold them. 

This question of room in Gehenna grows out of Isaiah 5:14: Assuredly, Sheol has opened 
wide its gullet and parted its jaws in a measureless gape. God then expands Gehenna in 
order to accommodate all the new sinners. 

In another version of this myth, instead of asking to be expanded, Gehenna asks 
for an additional category of sinners, those who know the Torah yet transgress it.

296. THE SIZE OF GEHENNA 

The wicked wonder, "How many myriads can Gehenna hold? Two hundred, three hun- 
dred myriads? How can it ever hold all the wicked who appear in every generation?" 

God replies, "As you increase, Gehenna, too, increases, growing wider and broader 
and deeper every day," as it is said, Hisfirepit has been made both wide and deep (Isa. 30:33). 
For even though God finished creating the world and rested from His work on the sev- 
enth day, yet He continues to ordain punishment for the wicked, and to bestow rewards 
upon the righteous. 

The point of this myth about Gehenna is that there will always be room for more 
sinners — God will see to that. The question of finding sufficient space for all the sin- 
ners of Gehenna is also addressed in "Gehenna Seething," p. 238.

297. THE GATES OF GEHENNA 

Gehenna is located at the north of the world, in the unfinished comer of creation. There 
are three princes of Gehenna, who have been appointed over its three gates. One gate is 
in the desert, where Korah and his followers fell to the underworld of Sheol. The second 
gate is in the Sea of Tarshish, and the third gate is in the valley of Gehinnom in Jerusalem. 
The three ministers of Gehenna, Kipod, Nagdasniel, and Samael, are in charge of these 
three gates. 

Gehenna itself is filled with the dwellings of demons. Among the inhabitants are harm- 
ful demons and destructive spirits, as well as many hosts of avenging angels. There the 
wicked are punished in the seven circles of Gehenna. 

Avenging angels lead wraithlike beings to the gates, whipping them onward. When 
they reach one of the gates of Gehenna, an angel strikes the gate with his fiery whip so 



240 MYTHS OF HELL 


that it swings open. Then the angels force them all inside, even though they try to resist. 
But they are no match for his whip. 

This myth fills in details about the entrances to Gehenna and who rules them, as 
well as which avenging angels and demons serve there. See " The Unfinished Comer 
of Creation," p. 213 and "The Openings of Gehenna," p. 233.

298. THE DOOR TO GEHENNA 

There is a door that leads to Gehenna. It is a danger to anyone standing nearby. Without 
warning, the door will swing open and a hand reach out and grab whoever is standing 
there and pull them into Gehenna, never to be seen again. Then the door will slam shut. 

This motif of the forbidden door is well known in world folklore. Perhaps the best- 
known version is that found in the fairy tale "Bluebeard." Such a door becomes an 
emblem for all taboos, reminding us of Eve's plucking of the forbidden fruit or of the 
Greek myth of Pandora. In the Talmud, Paradise and Gehenna are said to be as close 
as three fingerbreadths, implying that it is very easy to sin, and that the door to Gehenna 
confronts us at every turn. For a Jewish folktale based on this motif, see "The Door to 
Gehenna" in Lilith's Cave , pp. 64-70. For more on the punishments of Gehenna see Hell 
in Jewish Literature by Samuel J. Fox, which collects these sources.

299. THE GATEKEEPER OF GEHENNA 

The angel appointed over the gates of hell is Samriel. He sees that no one is admitted to 
Gehenna unless his name is listed in the giant Book of Gehenna that Samriel consults. 
Avenging angels drag the souls of sinners to Gehenna, and the gatekeeper makes sure 
that they deserve to be punished there. 

Samriel is appointed over the three gates of Gehenna that are found on the side of the 
wilderness. He has the keys for these three gates, and when he opens them, the light of 
the world seeps in. Samriel has three angels under him, with three shovels, who clear a 
path out of Gehenna so that the light of the world can enter and be seen by the inmates of 
Gehenna. 

Once in a while a sage or rabbi descends to Gehenna in order to obtain a bill of divorce 
from one of the souls being punished there. But the gatekeeper turns them all away, all 
except for Rabbi Naftali Katz. When Rabbi Naftali came there on a mission, the angel 
guarding the gate of Gehenna looked for his name in the Book of Gehenna, and refused 
to admit him when it wasn't there. Rabbi Naftali threatened to take a vow to remain there 
for eternity and to pester the angel until he let him in. So the angel let him in. 

The only ones permitted into Gehenna are the sinners who are brought there for 
punishment. However, there are a number of stories about sympathetic rabbis who 
attempted to enter Gehenna to ease the suffering of the sinners there. This myth ex- 
plains that there is an angel, Samriel, who guards the entrance of Gehenna in order to 
keep out anyone who does not belong. In the story "Rabbi Naftali's Trance," Rabbi 



THE HISTORY OF GEHENNA 241 


Naftali descends to Gehenna to search for a man who abandoned his wife without 
giving her a bill of divorce. Unlike many others who had sought entrance there. Rabbi 
Naftali intimidates the powerful angel who guards Gehenna and succeeds in going 
in. See "Rabbi Naftali's Trance" in Gabriel's Palace , pp. 152-154. See also the following 
tale, "The Messiah in Hell," p. 241.

300. THE MESSIAH IN HELL 

When Rabbi Joshua ben Levi found himself in the Garden of Eden, he decided to explore it 
as completely as he could. One by one he explored the nine palaces of the Garden of Eden, 
until he came to the palace of the Messiah. He recognized the Messiah by the splendor of 
his aura. There he saw how the patriarchs and kings came to the Messiah every Sabbath 
and holy day and wept, because it was not yet time for him to go forth into the world. 

When Rabbi Joshua came before the Messiah, the Messiah said, "How are my children 
faring?" And Rabbi Joshua said: "Every day they await you." Then the Messiah gave a 
great sigh and wept. 

After that the Messiah showed Rabbi Joshua all of the earthly garden and the heav- 
enly one as well, and revealed the greatest mysteries to him. But when Rabbi Joshua 
asked to be shown hell, at first the Messiah refused, for the righteous are not permitted to 
behold hell. But when Rabbi Joshua told him that it was his intention to measure hell 
from beginning to end, the Messiah agreed to take him there. 

So it was that Rabbi Joshua followed the Messiah until they reached the fiery gates of 
hell. When the angels guarding the gate saw that the Messiah was with him, they admit- 
ted him at once. Everywhere they went. Rabbi Joshua saw the punishments of hell, where 
avenging angels smite the wicked with flaming rods, and throw them into fiery pits, and 
after that hang them by their tongues, or by the organs with which they committed adul- 
tery. And although Rabbi Joshua tried to measure the compartments of hell, he found 
that they were boundless, as was the suffering of the wicked. But whenever the wicked 
in hell saw the light of the Messiah, they rejoiced and cried out, "There is the one who 
will bring us out of here." 

This myth about the descent of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi and the Messiah into hell 
builds on the talmudic account of Rabbi Joshua's highly irregular entrance into the 
Garden of Eden. See "Rabbi Joshua ben Levi and the Angel of Death," p. 206. There 
Rabbi Joshua is portrayed as fearless, and here he asks the Messiah, whom he meets in 
heaven, to show him hell. The Messiah finally agrees and they descend to Gehenna 
together. Rabbi Joshua tries to measure the compartments of Gehenna, but discovers 
that they are boundless, i.e., that they can contain any number of sinners. However, 
this visit serves to give hope to the sinners of Gehenna, who acclaim the Messiah as 
the one who will free them from there, since one of the traditions about the coming of 
the Messiah is that all those being punished in Gehenna will be raised from there to 
Paradise. The Messiah described here is Messiah ben David, the celestial Messiah, 
who lives in a heavenly palace and will only descend to earth when the time is right 
for the footsteps of the Messiah to be heard.

242 MYTHS OF HELL 


301. THE SABBATH RESURRECTION 

On the eve of every Sabbath, between the afternoon and evening prayers, the spirits of 
the dead are led to a field in front of a river that comes out of the Garden of Eden. There 
they drink from this river, and when the congregation says, "Blessed is the Lord who is 
blessed," they are returned to their graves and God resurrects them and they stand up 
alive from their graves. In this way all the dead of Israel rest on the Sabbath, and come in 
crowds and sing in the presence of the Lord. And they come and prostrate themselves in 
the synagogues, and come to behold the Divine Presence and bow before it. 

This myth is a variant of that about Sabbath in Gehenna. However, this one seems 
to assume that all of the spirits of the dead are in a Hades-like place where they are 
kept during the week, not necessarily Gehenna, but more like Sheol. Although it is 
vague on this point, the central focus of the myth, on the resurrection of all of the dead 
of Israel every Sabbath, is memorable and unique. It tells us that the Sabbath is not 
only celebrated by the living, but also by the dead. 

Sources: 

Seder Gan Eden in Beit ha-Midrash 5:43. 


302. THE ASHES OF SINNERS 

Every twelve months the sinners of Gehenna are burned to ashes, and the wind dis- 
perses them and carries those ashes under the feet of the just, as it is said. And you shall 
trample the wicked to a pulp, for they shall be dust beneath your feet (Mai. 3:21). 

Then the righteous take pity on the fate of the sinners and they pray for mercy upon 
them, and say, "Master of the Universe, these are the men who rose early to go to syna- 
gogue. They read the Shema, prayed, and performed other commandments." 

Hearing this, God revives them out of the ashes and stands them upon their feet and 
brings them to life in the World to Come. 

For most sinners the punishments of Gehenna are only supposed to last for up to 
12 months. After that, their souls have been purified, and they are able to slowly as- 
cend on high, through the seven heavens. What is amazing about this myth of sinners 
being burned to ashes is that their revival comes about because the righteous inter- 
cede for them. 

Of course, the notion of the sinners in Gehenna being burned to ashes is highly 
punitive. But the myth also includes an example of righteousness and generosity on 
the part of the just, whose prayers make it possible for those burned to ashes to be 
restored for life in the world to come. 

See "The Prince of Gehenna," p. 232, for more about the power of the prayers of the 
righteous.

Orhot Hayim-, Seder Eliyahu Rabbah 3; Yalkut Shim'oni, Malachi 593. 


303. PURIFIED SOULS 

When the process of purification has been completed, the chief angels take a soul out of 
Gehenna and lead it to the Gate of Paradise. There they say to the angels standing guard: 
"This soul was broken after its ordeal in the infernal fire, and now it has come to you pure 
and white." 

Then God causes the sun to penetrate the firmament and shed its rays on that soul and 
heal it. 



THE HISTORY OF GEHENNA 243 


The purpose of Gehenna is to purify the souls of sinners so that they can be permit- 
ted to enter paradise. This myth demonstrates how a soul is taken out of Gehenna. 
Note that this purification process is clearly described as a painful one, where the soul 
is purified in the fires of Gehenna. 

Sources: 

Zohar 2:211a. 


304. HOW THE DEAD SEE THE DEAD 

The day a person dies is the day of his judgment, when the soul parts from the body. A 
person does not leave this world until he sees the Shekhinuh , accompanied by three min- 
istering angels, who receive the soul of a righteous person. These angels examine a person's 
deeds, and insist that a person confess to all that the body has done with the soul in this 
world. After this confession, the soul of a righteous person rejoices in its parting from 
this world and looks forward with delight to the world to come. For when God takes the 
souls of the righteous. He takes it with gentleness. But when He takes the souls of the 
wicked. He does so through cruel angels, as it is said, Therefore a cruel angel shall be sent 
against him (Prov. 17:11). 

After a man dies he can be seen by all the others who are dead. To each of them he 
appears as they last saw him alive: some see him as a youth, others as an old man. For the 
angel who guards the dead makes his soul assume these various forms so that all should 
recognize him by seeing him just as they saw him in life. 

However, if a man is condemned to punishment in Gehenna, he is enveloped in smoke 
and brimstone, so that none of those being punished can see the punishment of any 
other. Thus none are put to shame, except for those who have put others to shame. 

This description of a man seeing the Shekhinah as he dies is based on Exodus 33:20: 

No man shall see Me and live. The three angels who accompany the Shekhinah are identi- 
fied as the three angels who visited Abraham in Genesis 18:2. 

It is characteristic of Jewish myth to describe in great detail unknown realms, such 
as heaven, hell, or what comes to pass when a person leaves this life. Here the dead 
are said to see each other exactly as they appeared when they last saw each other 
alive. This explanation of how the dead see and recognize each other solves the prob- 
lem of a person's changing appearance by aging. 

Sources: 

Sifre on Deuteronomy 357; Midrash ha~Ne'elam in Zohar 1:98a; Sefer ha-Zikhronot 11:6. 




There were two angels to every one of them, one to lay 
his hand on the heart of each one, to keep his heart 
still, and one to lift each one's head, so that he might 
behold the splendor of his Creator. 


Midrash Aseret ha-Dibrot 






THE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET 


305. CREATION BY WORD 

In the beginning a word was spoken from the mouth of God, and the heavens and the 
earth came into being, as it is said. By the word ofYahweh the heavens were made (Ps. 33:6). It 
was no wearisome labor for God, whose word came into being at the instant it was spo- 
ken. When God told the heavens to continue to spread out, they went on expanding, as it 
is said. Who spread out the skies like gauze, stretched them out like a tent to dwell in (Isa. 40:22). 
Indeed, if God had not said: "Enough!" they would have gone on expanding until the 
end of time. 

This creation myth presents a variant of Genesis 1:3, where God said " Let there be 
light/' and there was light. Here, too, the world is created through speech. God is said to 
have spoken a word, and the world came into being. Here, however, another word is 
required to stop the expansion of the heavens. This echoes the myth of the golem, a 
man made out of day, who, when told to bring water from the river, continues to 
bring barrels of water until the house is flooded, simply because no one told him to 
stop. The image of the world continuing eternally to expand suggests the modem 
theory of the Big Bang.

Ketz, 12; Midrash Tehillim 148.3; Raziel ha~Malakh 30. 


306. TWO WORLDS 

In the beginning God created not one world, but two. For two worlds came forth out of 
the first two letters of God's Name, YHVH. 

Some say that this world was created with the letter heh, while the World to Come was 
created with the letter yod. That is the meaning of the heaven and the earth were finished, and 
all their array (Gen. 2:1). 

Others say that no one knows which letter this world was created with, the yod or the 
he. This has remained a mystery, to this day. All that is known is that with those two 
letters God brought two worlds into being. 

This myth postulates that God created two worlds at the time of the creation, this 
world, Olam ha-Zeh, and the Olam ha-Ba, the World to Come. Midrash Tehillim 62:1 
links this myth of two worlds to the verse Truly my soul waits quietly for God (Ps. 62:2). 

It then adds, "Know you upon whom you wait? Upon Him who created two worlds 
with the letters of His Name: with yod and heh He created worlds, this world and the 
World to Come." There is a rabbinic debate over which letter was used to create the 
two worlds. Midrash Tehillim 114:3 declares that no one is certain which letter was 
used for which creation. 

Other rabbinic sources view heaven and earth as a single world. Indeed, Genesis 
Rabbah 1:15 recounts a heated rabbinic discussion about which was created first, the 
heaven or the earth: "The school of Shammai maintains that heaven was created first, 
while the school of Hillel maintains that earth was created first. In the view of Shammai, 
this is like a king who first made his throne and then made his footstool. Hillel com- 
pares it to a king who builds a palace — first he builds the foundation, then the upper 
portion. Hearing this. Rabbi Simeon said: 'I am amazed that the fathers of the world 
engage in controversy over this matter. Surely both were created at the same time, like 
a pot and its lid/" 

Eliyahu Rabbah follows this pattern of simultaneous creation, asserting that God 
created the heavens and the earth at the same time, in their entirety, and gave them 


247 



248 MYTHS OF THE HOLY WORD 


permanent form by shaping them. He gave them their finishing touch by hammering 
them out. In this way He made the earth fit to dwell in, while He stretched out the sky 
above it, as it is said. The heaven and the earth were finished (Gen. 2:1). 

Sources: 

Midrash Tehillim 62:1, 68:3, 114:3; Eliyahu Rabbah 31:29. 


307. THE PRIMORDIAL LANGUAGE 

Hebrew is the primordial tongue. Not only is Hebrew the language of the angels, it is the 
language in which God addressed Adam. 

One of the key assumptions of the rabbinic texts is that Hebrew is the sacred tongue, 
spoken in heaven as well as on earth. It is an axiom that Hebrew is the language of the 
angels. The Karaites, Jews who accepted the Bible but rejected the Talmud, shared this 
belief, as indicated here. 

Sources: 

Kitab al-riyad w'al-Hada'ik. 


308. THE CREATION OF THE TORAH 

God created the Torah at the very beginning, before the heavens were created and the 
earth was brought into being, before the mountains were sunk, before the hills were 
bom, before there were any streams or sources of water, as it is said, Yahweh created me at 
the beginning of His course (Prov. 8:22). It lay in God's bosom and sang praises of God 
along with the ministering angels. 

God wrote the Torah while seated on the Throne of Glory, high in the firmament above 
the heads of the celestial creatures. The Garden of Eden was at God's right hand, and 
Gehenna was at His left. The heavenly sanctuary was set up in front of Him, with the 
name of the Messiah engraved upon the altar. There, as the Torah rested on His knees, 
God wrote the letters in black fire on white fire. Later, it was tied to the arm of God, as it 
is said. Lightning flashing at them from His right (Deut. 33:2). Others say that the Torah was 
written on the arm of God, while still others say it was carved in fire on God's crown. 

The Torah was there when God created the heavens, drawing a circle on the face of the 
depths. So too was it there when God fashioned the heavens and set the streams into motion. 

The Torah was reared by God, and it was His daily joy, giving God great pleasure. 
Later Moses arose and brought it down to earth to give to humanity. 

Here the passage from Proverbs that is spoken by Wisdom is attributed to the To- 
rah: Yahweh created me at the beginning of His course (Prov. 8:22). Thus Wisdom and the 
Torah are identified as the same figure, since the Torah is regarded as the sum of 
Jewish wisdom. 

This myth answers the question of what the Torah was written on before it was 
given to Moses. The answer is that it was written with black fire on white fire and tied 
to the arm of God. An alternate version says that it was tied to the knee of God. Still 
another version says that the Torah was carved with fire on God's crown. 

According to Avot de-Rabbi Natan , God created the Torah 974 generations before the 
world was created.

THE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET 249 


309. CREATION BY THE TORAH 

The Torah was one of the seven things created before the creation of the world, and the 
Torah served as God's advisor when He was about to create this world. God looked into 
the Torah and created the world and all created beings through it. 

When the time came to create man, the Torah said, "Master of the Universe, the world 
is Yours to create. The days of this man You want to create will be short and full of anger, 
and he will be drawn into sin. If You are not going to have patience with him, it's better 
for him not to be created." 

God answered, "It's not for nothing that I'm called Merciful." 

After that God consulted only the Torah, and let the Torah serve as a blueprint for all 
creation. So too did the Torah serve as an artisan in all the work of creation. With the 
assistance of the Torah, God stretched out the heavens and established the earth. With 
the Torah He bound up the sea, lest it go forth and overflow the world. With the Torah He 
locked up the deep, so that it might not inundate the world. So too did He fashion the sun 
and moon with it. Thus we learn that the world was indeed founded upon the Torah, and 
that God created the world and all created beings through the Torah. How did God do 
this? He looked into the Torah and created the world with it. With every single act of 
creation, God looked into the Torah, and created that detail of creation. 

Others say that God fashioned the world according to the Torah. Looking at the word 
"heavens," God created the heavens. Looking at the word "light," He created light. So it 
went with each and every word of the Torah. In this way the world came into being. 

Still others say that God opened the Torah and took a name that had not been given to 
any creature, and let three drops of that name fall into the sea. Those drops became filled 
with water and with the Holy Spirit, for The spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters 
(Gen. 1:1). Thus the Shekhinah was present in that place. 

God opened the Torah again and took out a second name. This time God took three drops 
of light: one for the light of this world, one for the light of the World to Come , and one for the 
light of the Torah. For there is a holy light hidden in the Torah, and in order to discover it, it is 
necessary to probe deeply into the Torah, and one day the light of the Torah will shine forth. 

Then God opened the Torah for the third time, and took out three drops of fire, and 
from that fire the whole world is heated. 

God saw fire on His right, light on His left, and water beneath Him. He mixed them 
together two by two. He took fire and water and mixed them together, and made heaven 
out of them. So too did God take water and light and make a tent of darkness of them, as 
well as the Clouds of Glory. And out of fire and light God made the holy beasts. 

Thus not only was the Torah created prior to the creation of the world, it was the vessel 
by which the world was created. In this way the universe came into being through the 
letters of the Torah. 

So too did God declare, at the time of man's creation, that the world was created only 
for the sake of the Torah, and that as long as the Jewish people occupy themselves with 
the Torah, the world will continue to exist. But if the Jewish people abandon the Torah, 
God will return all of creation to a state of chaos. 

God is able to consult the Torah because it is one of the seven things created before 
the creation. See "Seven Things Created before the Creation," p. 74. A parable is given to 
explain God's use of the Torah to create the world: "When a king wishes to build a 
palace, he does not build it himself but brings in an artisan. Nor does the artisan build it 
himself. He uses sketches and notebooks. So too did God look into the Torah and create 
the world." ( Genesis Rabbah 1:1). Here the Torah is presented as an "artisan," not simply 
as a text to be consulted, while God is the architect, that is, an active, creating force. 

Here the Torah seems to participate in the creation in much the same way as the angels 
are said to have done in other rabbinic sources. See "Creation by Angels," p. 116. 



250 MYTHS OF THE HOLY WORD 


In the second example of God creating the world from the Torah, found in Midrash 
Konen, God takes a name out of the Torah and transforms it into drops of water, light, 
and fire, the elements with which God creates the world. This myth provides the origin 
of the primordial elements with which God was able to create the world, having them 
find their origin in a name found in the Torah. Such a name or names, usually the name 
of an angel, is used to invoke various kinds of spells in the Jewish magical tradition. It 
makes the creation of those elements itself a step in the creation process, thus making it 
a part of God's overall plan. In this scenario, God created the Torah, which, in turn, was 
used to create the elements, which were used to create the world. This tradition prob- 
ably emerged in response to the Gnostic view that the primordial elements— darkness, 
light, water, and fire— already existed when God decided to proceed with creation. 

Philo also offers the metaphor of God having used a blueprint in the creation of the 
world, but he does not identify this blueprint with the Torah, but rather with a blue- 
print in an architect's mind. 

Three types of light are reported to have been created in this myth: the light of this 
world (Olam ha-Zeh), the light of the World to Come (Olam ha-Ba), and the light of the 
Torah. Each one is created out of a word of the Torah, one that was not the name of 
any creature. 

The Zohar and later the Ba'al Shem Tov linked the light of the first day, known as 
the hidden light (or ha-ganuz), with the light of the Torah. Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, 
the greatest Jewish storyteller, added to this interpretation his view that the light could 
be found in the stories of the Torah. See "The Light of the First Day," p. 83, and "Light 
from the Temple," p. 411. According to Rabbi Hayim of Volozhin, the Torah did not 
actively participate in Creation, but nevertheless played an essential role: "At the time 
of Creation, the Torah illuminated the universe from a remote distance to give it life 
and sustain it. Still, the world remained unsettled until the giving of the Torah 2000 
years later" (Nefesh ha-Hayim 4:1). 

The basis for the assertion that God will destroy the world if the Jewish people 
abandon the Torah is Jeremiah 33:25: "If not for My Covenant , I would not have set day 
and night and the bounds of heaven and earth."

310. THE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET 

For two thousand years prior to the creation of the world, all the letters of the Hebrew 
alphabet were hidden. During that time, God gazed upon the letters and delighted in 
them. Then, when God was about to create the world, all twenty-two letters engraved 
upon His crown came down and stood before him, from tav to aleph. The letter tav ap- 
proached first and said: "O Lord, create the world through me, for I am at the beginning 
of the word 'Torah.'" 

God replied, “Tav, You are worthy and deserving, and in the days to come I shall com- 
mand that you be put as a sign on the foreheads of the righteous, so that when the de- 
stroying angel comes to punish sinners, he will see the letter on their foreheads and spare 
them." But the letter tav was sad that it would not be used to create the world, and it left 
the presence of the Lord. 

Then, one by one, each of the other letters came forward and pleaded with God to 
create the world through them. But God did not grant their wish. Soon all that remained 



THE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET 251 


were two letters, aleph and bet . Bet came forth and said, "O Lord, it would be appropriate 
to create the world through me, for your children will praise you through me every time 
they say 'Blessed be the Lord for ever and ever/ 

Then God said, "Blessed are you who comes in the name of the Lord." And God took 
the letter bet and created the world through it. 

All this time the letter aleph had stood silent. Then God called it and said, "Why are 
you silent?" Aleph replied, "Master of the Universe, I am the least among the letters, for 
my value is but one. How can I presume to approach you?" 

The words of the letter aleph were pleasing to God, and He said, "Because you are so 
modest, aleph, you shall become the foremost among the letters, for just as your value is 
one, so am I one and the Torah is one." 

So it is that the aleph is the first letter of the alphabet, while bet is the first letter of 
Bereshit, the first word of the Torah, which means "in the beginning." 

God informs the letter tav that in the future it is destined to serve as a mark on the 
foreheads of the faithful ones who have kept the Law, and through the absence of this 
mark the rest will be killed. This refers to the vision in Ezekiel 9 where the word 
usually translated as "man" is tav in Hebrew. 

Bet is the first letter of the word barukh, blessed, which is the first word used in a 
wide range of blessings. 

Note that in Hebrew the letters serve also as numbers, so that aleph is literally one.

311. CREATION BY LETTERS 

With letters, heaven and earth were created, the oceans and rivers were created, all the 
world's needs and all the orders of Creation. And each letter flashed over and over again 
like lightning. 

The world was created with the letter bet, because it stands for "blessing," not with the 
aleph , which stands for "curse." Others say that two worlds were created with two let- 
ters — the yod and the heh — this world and the World to Come. The account of creation 
opens with the letter bet (which serves as the number two) in order to teach that these 
two worlds exist. 

Bezalel, the architect of the tabernacle, knew how to combine the letters through which 
heaven and earth were created. 

There are a variety of traditions about how the world was created. "Creation by 
Word," p. 247, suggests that the heavens and earth came into being as a result of God's 
speech. Here it is not the speech, but the letters of the words to which the power of 
creation is attributed. This myth also suggests that Bezalel, whose abilities as an archi- 
tect were legendary, drew his power from knowing how to combine the letters that 
had been used to create the world. A similar tradition concerns the creation of the 
golem, the man made out of clay. The golem was said to have been brought to life 
through the letters of the word emet, which were inscribed on its forehead, and through 
the Tetragrammaton, the four-letter Name of God, inscribed on a piece of parchment, 
which was placed inside its mouth. See "The Golem of Prague," p. 281.

252 MYTHS OF THE HOLY WORD 


312. THE SHINING LETTERS 

Most people derive pleasure from eating and drinking, not from the light shining through 
the letters. The Tzaddik, however, derives no pleasure from eating or drinking or other 
bodily pleasures. Instead, he is renewed by the shining letters, and derives all his plea- 
sure from them. For the letters of the holy tongue animate every object. And the Tzaddik, 
when reaching for an object, can actually grasp the letters within it. 

Basic kabbalistic doctrine holds that the interaction of the letters of a word is di- 
rectly linked to what that word represents. Indeed, every object has at its essence the 
letters that make it up. Most people are oblivious to this inner truth, the letters glow- 
ing inside of every object. But the Tzaddikim—fae righteous ones— are well aware of 
these letters and are even able to grasp them. Here Rabbi Nachman expands, as he 
often does, on the remarkable spiritual insight of the Tzaddik.

Likutei Moharan 1:19. 


313. THE TORAH WRITTEN ON THE ARM OF GOD 

Prior to the creation of the world, there were no animals, therefore there were no skins 
of parchment on which to write the Torah. How, then, was the Torah written? On the arm 
of God, with black fire on white fire. And God took the Torah and placed it before Him 
and gazed at it, and read it from beginning to end. And as He read those words, they 
came to pass. 

While writing on parchment is not as ancient as writing on clay tablets, it was the 
method used to record the most ancient Jewish texts, and to this day possession of a 
parchment scroll of the Torah is considered a necessity for every Jewish congregation. 

Since there was a well-known tradition that the Torah was one of the seven things cre- 
ated before the rest of the world, this myth attempts to resolve the problem of where the 
Torah was written down before there were skins to use as parchment. The answer given 
is a surprising one — that it was written on the arm of God, and that God read it from 
where it was inscribed on His arm. This myth suggests how closely the Torah was asso- 
ciated with God, so much so that it was inscribed on His arm like a tattoo.

314. GOD'S ORIGINAL PLAN 

According to God's original plan, a thousand generations were supposed to pass before 
the Torah was given. But nine hundred and seventy-four of those generations were swept 
away in the wink of an eye, for God saw that they would give themselves to wickedness. 
After they were carried off, they were gone like a dream, as it is said. You engulf men in 
sleep (Ps. 90:5). 

So it was that God gave the Torah to Moses in the twenty-sixth generation from Adam, 
which would have been the thousandth generation. 

Here God changes His original plan, which was to give the Torah in the thou- 
sandth generation. Instead, foreseeing the wickedness of the coming generations. He 
eliminated 974 of them, speeding the process of the giving of the Torah to the twenty- 
sixth generation. 



THE PRIMORDIAL TORAH 253 


The notion of God changing His original plan is intriguing, since God has the abil- 
ity to foresee the future. 

This myth is an interesting variation on the theme that God created and destroyed 
974 worlds prior to this one. Here, instead of 974 worlds, there are an equal number of 
generations. See 'Trior Worlds/' p. 71.

315. THE BOOK OF RAZIEL 

The Book was revealed to Adam while he was still in the Garden of Eden, to show him each 
generation and its sages, each generation and its leaders. How did God show him genera- 
tions that did not yet exist? Some say that God cast sleep upon him and showed him, while 
others say that Adam saw them all with his eyes, for whatever he read in that book he saw 
with his own vision. For since the time the world was created, all of the souls of those yet to 
be bom stand before God in the very same form in which they will live in this world. 

God sent the angel Raziel, the Angel of Secrets, to read the Book to Adam. But when 
Adam heard the first words issue from the mouth of the angel, he fell down in fear. 
Therefore God let Raziel leave the Book with him so that he could read from it on his 
own, and in this way Adam came to know the future and was made wise in all things. 

Some say that book was written on parchment, while others say it was engraved on a 
sapphire. How was that sapphire read? Adam held it up to his eyes, and the flame burn- 
ing inside that sapphire took the form of the letters, so Adam could read them there. So 
too there are those who say that the true text of the Book of Raziel was the Torah, for the 
Torah was one of the seven things created before the rest of Creation, and this way its 
wisdom was transmitted even to the first man. 

Contained in the Book was a secret writing that explained seventy-two branches of 
wisdom, mysteries which had not been revealed even to the other angels. So too did the 
Book contain the entire history, past and future, of mankind. Whenever Adam opened 
the Book, angels gathered around him to learn all the mystical secrets it contained. Then 
the angels made a plea to God, saying, "Impart the mystery of Your glory to the angels, 
not to men." Instead, the angel Hadamiel was secretly sent to Adam and said: "Adam, 
Adam, do not reveal the glory of your Master, for to you alone and not to the angels is the 
privilege given to know these mysteries." 

After that Adam kept the Book concealed, and read it in secret. In this way he learned 
mysteries not even known by the angels. But at last the envy of the angels became so 
great that they stole the Book and threw it into the sea. Adam searched for it in vain, and 
then fasted for many days, until a celestial voice announced: "Fear not, Adam, I will give 
the Book back to you." Then God called upon Rahab, the angel of the sea, and ordered 
him to recover the Book from the depths of the sea and to give it to Adam, and so he did. 

When Adam transgressed, the Book flew away from him. But Adam begged God for 
its return, and beat his breast, and entered the river Gihon up to his neck, until his body 
became wrinkled and his face haggard. Then God made a sign for the angel Raphael, the 
Angel of Healing, to heal Adam and bring the book back to him. After that Adam studied 
the book intently, and bequeathed it to his son Seth. So it went on, through successive 
generations, as it is said. This is the book of the generations of Adam (Gen. 5:1). 

In this way the book was handed down from Seth to Enosh to Kenan to Jared, and in 
this way it reached Enoch. It was from this Book that Enoch drew his vast knowledge of 
the Mysteries of Creation. Before he was taken up into heaven and transformed into the 
angel Metatron, Enoch entrusted the book to his son, Methuselah, who read the Book 



254 MYTHS OF THE HOLY WORD 


and transmitted it to his son Lantech, and from there it reached Noah, Lamech's son, who 
made use of its instructions in building the ark. Indeed, there are those who insist that 
the book was revealed to Noah by the angel Raziel. They say that Noah heard the book 
from the mouth of Raziel and later the angel wrote it down for him on a sapphire stone. 

By reading this book it was possible for Noah to penetrate great secrets of knowledge, 
hierarchies of understanding, and ideas of wisdom, to know the way of life and the way 
of death, the way of good and the way of evil, and to foresee the concerns of each and 
every year, whether for peace or for war, for plenty or for hunger, for harvest or for 
drought. By gazing there the destinies of the stars were revealed, as well as the course of 
the sun and the names of the guardians of each and every firmament. Revealed as well 
were the secrets of how to interpret dreams and visions, and how to rule over all of a 
man s desires, as well as how to drive away evil spirits and demons. Happy was the eye 
that beheld that book, and happy the ear that listened to its wisdom, for in it were re- 
vealed all the secrets of heaven and earth. 

Noah placed the Book into a golden box and it was the first thing he brought into the 
ark. In this way it came to be revealed to Abraham, whose knowledge of it permitted him 
to gaze upon the glory of God. And from Abraham it was passed down to Isaac and to 
Jacob and to Joseph, who consulted it to discover the true meanings of dreams. The book 
was buried with Joseph, and in this way it was preserved when his coffin was raised by 
Moses from the Nile and carried beside the Tabernacle throughout the wandering of the 
Israelites in the wilderness. 

In this way the Book came into the possession of King Solomon, who made good use 
of its wisdom, and also sought its assistance in constructing the Temple. Some say that 
the book was lost again when the Temple was destroyed, its letters soaring on high as 
flames approached the Sanctuary in which it was hidden. Yet there are others who say 
that it was saved from the flames, and has been secretly passed down ever since. In this 
way it was said to have reached Rabbi Adam, and from Rabbi Adam it was passed down 
to the Ba'al Shem Tov, who learned the supernal mysteries from reading it and in this 
way became the Tzaddik of his generation. 

This is the most famous of all the chain midrashim, a linked set of myths. It tells the 
story of how God sent the angel Raziel to reveal this book to Adam, and how Adam 
came into possession of it. Subsequent myths describe how the book was passed down 
from Adam to Noah, following the genealogy in Genesis 5, and later reached the pa- 
triarchs and kings. The book that the angel Raziel left with Adam has two names: it is 
known as The Book of Raziel and as The Book of Adam. Raziel ha-Malakh explicitly records 
the transmission of the book from Adam to Enoch to Noah to Abraham, Isaac, Levi, 

Moses and Aaron, Pinhas, and so on down the generations. 

The myth of the Book of Raziel grows out of a midrash attempting to explain the 
verse. This is the book of the generations of Adam (Gen. 5:1). In B. Avodah Zarah 5a, Resh 
Lakish is quoted as saying: "Did Adam have a book? This implies that God showed to 
Adam every generation that would ever exist, every generation with its sages and its 
leaders. When Adam reached the generation of Rabbi Akiba, he rejoiced at his teach- 
ing, but was grieved about his death." 

While most accounts of this heavenly book assume that the book had already been 
written and that Adam heard it for the first time when the angel Raziel read it to him, 
the Maharal proposes an alternate scenario in which Adam had all future events re- 
vealed to him in a vision, and later they were recorded in this book. That the angel 
leaves the book for Adam to read later indicates that books are so important in Jewish 
tradition that even the first man could read. 

The earliest mention of the angel Raziel is in the Book of Enoch. Raziel ha-Malakh, 
first published in Amsterdam in 1701, claimed to be the book that the angel Raziel 
gave to Adam. It largely consists of the names of God and of the angels, and the texts 
of amulets. The book itself was believed to have talismanic powers, especially the 
ability to ward off fires and other disasters. For this reason it was commonly found in 
many Jewish homes. . 



THE PRIMORDIAL TORAH 255 


The angel Raziel, who delivered The Book ofRaziel to Adam, plays a role in Jewish 
mythology equivalent to Hermes in Greek mythology. That is, he serves as a messen- 
ger of God, while Hermes (Mercury) is a messenger of the gods. Rahab, the Angel of 
the Sea, is the Jewish mythic equivalent of Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea.

316. CREATING NEW HEAVENS AND A NEW EARTH 

God constantly creates new heavens and a new earth from the new meanings that are 
discovered in the Torah. When the Torah was given to Moses, tens of thousands of angels 
on high were about to bum him with the flames of their mouths, but God protected him. 
Since then, whenever a new interpretation of the Torah is uttered, the saying rises up, is 
adorned with a crown, and then stands before God. And God guards that saying and 
keeps it hidden, and shelters the person who said it, to prevent the angels from envying 
him until a new heaven and a new earth are created from that saying. Thus every word 
that receives a new interpretation by one who delves into the study of the Torah creates a 
new heaven and a new earth, as it is said, "That I may plant the heavens , and lay the founda- 
tions of the earth" (Isa. 51:16). 

This myth, based on Isaiah 66:22, demonstrates the primary role of interpreting the 
Torah, going as far as to assert that new interpretations are not only essential, but that God 
sees that they are crowned, protects them from the envy of the angels, and uses them as 
the basis for creating a new heaven and a new earth. What does "a new heaven and a new 
earth" mean? It means that the new interpretations that arise about the meanings of the 
Torah so radically change the perspective and understanding of those who receive them, 
that the heavens and earth seem new to them. This myth is thus an ode to the remarkable 
power of interpretation, and of the necessity for new interpretations to continue to be 
made, to prevent the views of the Torah from becoming static. See "A New Torah," p. 522.

Zohar l:4b-5a. 

317. GOD'S WARNING 

God created this world with the following stipulation: "If Israel accepts the Torah when 
I offer it to them, then creation will continue to exist. Otherwise I will return the world to 
chaos and void. For the world only exists for the sake of the Torah. Thus if the Torah 
would cease to be studied, the world would cease to exist'" 

When the time came for the Giving of the Torah, God summoned all the people of the 
world and offered them the Torah, but none accepted it. The earth trembled on hearing 
this, for it feared it was on the point of returning to chaos. Israel was the last possibility, and 
the earth assumed that Israel, too, would turn down the Torah. But when Israel accepted 
the Torah, the earth became calm, as it is said. The earth was numbed with fright (Ps. 76:9). 

Here God makes the existence of the world contingent on the acceptance and study 
of the Torah. This represents one tradition about the Giving of the Torah — that it was 
not an offer, but a demand. See "God Offers the Torah to Israel," p. 264. It is said that 
God offered the Torah to Israel on the sixth of Sivan in the year 2448, in the 26th 



256 MYTHS OF THE HOLY WORD 


generation since the creation of the world (B. Pes. 118a). By implication, the fact that the 
world still exists confirms that there has never been a time devoid of faith in the Torah. 

In Likutei Moharan, Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav asserts that the world can only con- 
tinue to exist if there are people in it who believe that it was created from nothing. For 
if there is no one alive who believes this, the world will cease to exist.

318. THE LIGHT OF THE TORAH 

The light of the Torah existed prior to the creation of the world, as it is said, God said, "Let 
there be light," and there was light (Gen. 1:3). When God spoke at Mount Sinai, this great 
light issued from the Word of the Lord and filled the whole earth. All the kings assembled 
and came to Balaam to ask if God was about to bring a second Flood upon the earth. 
Balaam said, "He is now giving His Torah to the children of Israel. That Torah is the 
source of this great light that frightens you." 

There is an extensive tradition about light associated with creation, which grows 
out of Genesis 1:3 and the rabbinic myths associated with the primordial light. See 
"The Light of the First Day," p. 83. Here the source of the light is described as being 
the Torah, and this idea is later developed in the Zohar, where it is said that a ray of 
h8rhf goes forth from the Torah whenever one who is studying it experiences the illu- 
mination of understanding. The primordial light was said to have been hidden away, 
and Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav suggested it was hidden in the Torah, which corre- 
sponds with this myth, since the light had its origin there in the first place. Rabbi 
Baruch of Kossov speaks of two kinds of light, a physical light and a spiritual light. 

When a person understands a verse of the Torah, he sees a light. This light stems from 
the essential light of the soul.

319. THE BETROTHAL OF THE TORAH 

At the end of the sixth day of Creation, when God saw all that He had made, and found it very 
good (Gen. 1:31), the Torah came forth from her bridal chamber dressed in all kinds of 
jewelry and royal ornaments, and danced before God. She opened her lips in wisdom and 
praised God with all manner of song. When God said to her, "Show me your appearance," 
she bowed her head and lifted her veil, and the splendor of her face filled all the palaces of 
heaven. When God said to her, "Let me hear your voice," she lifted her voice in song. Then 
a heavenly voice went forth to say The teaching of Yahweh is perfect, renewing life (Ps. 19:8). 

Then God revealed the Throne of Glory to the Torah, and brought forth all the souls of 
the righteous, the souls of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the souls of Israel who would 
accept the Torah in the future, and He let them pass before her. After this God brought 
forth the soul of Moses from beneath his throne, and showed him to the Torah, and said 
to her, "My daughter, rejoice and be happy, for this Moses is destined to become your 
bridegroom. It is he who will accept you and love you and reveal you to the myriads of 
Israel at Mount Sinai." Then the Torah answered and said, "How long until the time of 
my rejoicing arrives?" God replied, "From the day that I created you until a thousand 
generations have been fulfilled." 



THE PRIMORDIAL TORAH 257 


Here the Torah is personified as a bride who appears at the end of the sixth day of 
creation, as the culmination of all that was created. At first it appears that the Torah 
will be the bride of God, but later it is revealed that Moses will be her bridegroom in 
the future. It is interesting to note that this midrash attributes no role to the Torah in 
the actual creation, although other rabbinic legends describe the Torah as the plan by 
which God created the world. See "Creation by the Torah," p. 249. Another wedding 
metaphor is found in the Sephardic Mahzor , where God is portrayed as the Bride- 
groom and Israel as the bride, and the Torah serves as the ketubah, or wedding con- 
tract, between them. See "The Wedding Between God and Israel," p. 305. 

The bridelike qualities of the Torah are also emphasized by Maimonides in ex- 
plaining the counting of the Omer in the 49 days between the second day of Passover 
and Shavuot: "Shavuot is the day of the Giving of the Torah. The momentous nature 
of that date is expressed in the numbering of every day, bringing it nearer, just as a 
lover counts the days and even hours that bring the day of meeting with the beloved 
nearer." 

There is an important parable in Zohar 2:98b-99b about a lovely maiden in a palace 
closed from all sides who can only reveal her face briefly to her lover from a tiny 
opening in the wall. This maiden represents the Torah, which reveals a little of itself at 
a time, at first only the literal meaning, but later reveals deeper levels of understand- 
ing. Another way of reading it is to see the maiden as the Shekhinah. Variants of this 
parable are found in Seder ha-Yom by Moses ben Judah Makhir and Hemdat Yamim 
3:51 a-b. A Rapunzel-like folktale with a similar situation is found in the Preface to 
Midrash Tanhuma. See "The Princess in the Tower" in Elijah's Violin, pp. 47-52.

320. THE VESTMENT OF THE SHEKHINAH 

The Torah is the vestment of the Shekhinah. If man had not been created, the Shekhinah 
would have been without a garment, like a beggar. Thus when a man sins, it is as if he 
tears away the vestments of the Shekhinah. And when he fulfills the precepts of the Torah, 
it is as though he clothes the Shekhinah in her vestments. 

Here the Torah and the Shekhinah are closely linked by suggesting that the Torah 
serves as the garment of the Shekhinah. This brief myth from the Zohar also suggests 
that when a person sins, it is not only a sin against the Torah, but against the Shekhinah, 
since it causes the garment of the Shekhinah to be tom away, an outrageous offense 
against the Bride of God.

321. THE LETTERS AND THE BURNING BUSH 

When God appeared to Moses in the burning bush, Moses found twenty-two letters written 
before him with devouring fire. Those letters formed the mystical image of God, and by 
peering into those letters, Moses was able to perceive the presence of God, and by means 
of those letters Moses was able to expound the Law. 



258 MYTHS OF THE HOLY WORD 


This Samaritan myth links the letters of the Hebrew alphabet with Moses' vision of 
the burning bush. It links the vision with Moses' later role in recording the Torah that 
God dictated to him at Mount Sinai, and suggests that in that vision at the burning 
bush Moses not only had a revelation about God, but also had a revelation about the 
Torah that it would be his destiny to receive. 

Most Samaritan myths, like this one, focus on Moses, who plays a near-messianic 
role in Samaritan tradition. See "The Burning Bush/' p. 375.

322. THE ANGELS AND THE GIVING OF THE TORAH 

When God wished to give the Torah to Israel, the ministering angels said to him: "Master 
of the Universe, it is proper for the Torah to remain in heaven." God said to the angels: 
"Why does it matter to you?" The angels replied: "We are afraid that in the future You 
will bring Your Divine Presence down to the earthly beings." God replied: "I am giving 
my Torah to the earthly beings, but I will continue to live among the heavenly beings." 

The day God went down to give the Torah, sixty myriads of ministering angels de- 
scended with Him. But when God was about to give the Torah to Israel, the angels again 
objected. The angels said to God, "It would be better if You extended Your majesty only 
to the heavens above, and if You gave the Torah only to us." 

God replied, "Are you the ones who will fulfill the Torah? The Torah cannot remain 
with you. It would not be appropriate for it to remain in a realm of creatures who have 
eternal life." 

Then, without further ado, God dismissed the angels and gave the Torah to Israel. 

This mythic account of the angels' resistance to God giving the Torah to Israel is 
parallel to that of the angels' original resistance to the creation of man. See "God Con- 
sults the Angels About the Creation of Adam," p. 131. In both cases the angels are por- 
trayed as jealous of God's affection for humans, and especially for Israel. The angels 
also resist Moses' ascent into heaven to receive the Torah, threatening to throw him 
from on high. Here, again, God comes to the rescue. See "The Ascent of Moses," p. 261.

323. THE QUARREL OF THE MOUNTAINS 

When the mountains heard that God was going to give the Torah on a mountain, they 
quarreled among themselves. Each said, "God will give the Torah on me." And the moun- 
tains moved from their places and ran into the wilderness, for they knew that God would 
give the Torah where no one could say, "Depart from here for this territory belongs to me." 

Mount Tabor said to Mount Carmel, "Go back to your place, for the Lord has not 
called you." Mount Carmel answered, "You return to your place, for the Lord has not 
called you." And God heard the quarrel of the mountains and said, "Why do you quar- 
rel? Neither of you is equal to Mount Sinai, for men have worshipped other gods on you. 
But Mount Sinai is holy, for no man has set idols on it. And that is the mountain that I 
have chosen to dwell upon." 

This myth about the mountains quarreling over who would receive the honor of 
having the Torah given from it follows a pattern found in myths about the alphabet. 



COD OFFERS THE TORAH TO ISRAEL 259 


where the letters argue over which letter should have the honor of being first in the 
alphabet. See "The Letters of the Alphabet/' p. 250. In each case it is God who makes 
the final decision, and here God selects Mount Sinai because there has been no idol 
worship there. This gives the mountain a kind of spiritual purity appropriate for its 
historic role.

Genesis Rabbah 99:1; Yalkut Shim'oni. 


324. THE NECKLACE OF LETTERS 

When God was ready to give the Torah to Israel, God made the letters of the Torah into a 
necklace and hung it around the neck of Israel, as it is said. She will adorn your head with a 
graceful wreath , crown you with a glorious diadem (Prov. 4:9). But it was not long before the 
children of Israel forsook the Torah, as it is said, "They forsook My Torah and rejected it" (Jer. 
6:19). At that time God arranged the twenty-two letters of the Torah into acrostics of woe, 
to indicate the grievous events that would befall Israel. 

Just as the Torah is sometimes described as a ketubah , a wedding contract, between 
God and Israel, here the letters of the Torah are described as a necklace God gives to 
Israel as a precious gift. But when the people forsake the Torah, God arranges the letters 
into acrostics that prophesy grievous events. This myth thus portrays both God's gen- 
erous and angry aspects. The acrostics referred to here are those found in the first four 
chapters of the Book of Lamentations. See "The Marriage of God and Israel," p. 305.

325. DEATH AND REBIRTH AT MOUNT SINAI 

Moses brought forth the people to meet God. Yahweh came down upon Mount Sinai , on the 
top of the mountain (Exod. 19:20). In that hour the world was completely silent. No one 
dared to breathe. No bird sang, no ox lowed, the sea did not roar, and no creature uttered 
a sound. Then God opened the portals of the seven firmaments and appeared over them 
eye to eye, in His beauty, in His glory, in the fullness of His stature, with His crown and 
upon His Throne of Glory. When He began to speak, thunder and lightning issued from 
God's mouth, and all of Israel flew back in horror at the sound of the awful voice. They 
ran without stopping for twelve miles, until their hearts gave out and their souls fled 
from them. All of them lay dead. 

Then the Torah turned to God, saying, "Master of the Universe! Are You giving me to 
the living or to the dead?" God replied, "To the living." The Torah said, "But they are all 
dead." And God said, "For your sake I will revive them." So God let the dew of life fall 
from heaven, and as soon as it touched the people, they were restored to life, and they 
became strong and of good courage. That is why, at the resurrection of the dead in the 
End of Days, the Torah will stand up for the restoring of people's lives. 

Still, the people trembled mightily, even more than before. Nor were they brave enough 
to look up and gaze upon the Lord. They were not even strong enough to stand on their 
feet. God saw that their hearts would give out again, so He sent to earth one hundred and 
twenty myriads of ministering angels, so that there were two angels to every one of them, 
one to lay his hand on the heart of each one, to keep his heart still, and one to lift each 
one's head, so that he might behold the splendor of his Creator. 



260 MYTHS OF THE HOLY WORD 


In this way, awestruck but comforted by the angels, they each beheld the glory of God. 
Then God asked, "Will you accept the Torah?" And they all answered together, "Yes!" 

At that moment God opened up the seven heavens, as well as the seven earths, and all of 
Israel gazed from one end of the universe to the other. And God said, "Behold that there is 
none like Me in heaven or on earth." And they saw with their own eyes that it was true. 

This haunting myth recounts that when God appeared on Mount Sinai, the shock 
of His voice caused all of the people to drop dead. God then revived them and gave 
each of the 600,000 Jews assembled there two angels, one on his right hand and one on 
his left. The function of the angels was to calm the people enough for them to stand in 
the presence of God without having their souls flee from their bodies in terror. Each of 
the angels is said to have quoted a verse of the Torah. One angel said: "It has been 
clearly demonstrated to you that Yahweh alone is God; there is none beside Him" (Deut. 4:35). 

And the other angel said: "Know therefore this day and keep in mind that the Lord alone is 
God in heaven above and on earth below; there is no other" (Deut. 4:39). 

The myth of the two angels at Mount Sinai is found in Midrash Aseret ha-Dibrot 
( Midrash of the Ten Commandments), where it is a commentary on the first command- 
ment, I am the Lord your God (Ex. 20:2). Each of the stories in the collection is linked to 
one of the ten commandments. Midrash Aseret ha-Dibrot, dating from around the ninth 
century, is regarded as the first story anthology in Jewish literature.

326. THE SEVEN VOICES OF THE TORAH 

The Torah was given through seven voices. And the people saw the Lord of the World 
revealed in every one of those voices. That is the meaning of the verse All the people saw 
the voices (Exod. 20:15). These voices were accompanied by sparks of fire and flashes of 
lightning like the letters of the commandments. They saw the fiery word issuing forth 
from the mouth of the Almighty and being engraved on the tablets, as it is said. The voice 
of the Lord engraves flames of fire (Ps. 29:4). 

And when the people actually saw Him-Who-Spoke-and-the-World-Came-Into-Be- 
ing, they fainted away. Some say that their spirit departed from them, while others say 
that they entered a prophetic trance. These visions brought them trembling and shaking 
and a blackout of the senses. 

This myth describes the intense revelatory experience of those present at Mount 
Sinai. It is sometimes described as a prophetic trance, sometimes as a blackout, some- 
times as their spirits taking flight. See "Death and Rebirth at Mount Sinai," p. 259. 

Note that this experience at Sinai includes a direct visual and aural perception of God— 
not only of God's voice (or seven voices), but an actual vision of God Himself. This 
makes it by far the greatest revelation in Jewish history. 

Midrash Tanhuma, Shemot 22 states that the voice of God split into 70 different voices. 

This echoes the tradition of the 70 faces of the Torah, meaning that there are 70 differ- 
ent ways of reading and understanding the Torah.

327 . THE ASCENT OF MOSES 

With the children of Israel assembled at the foot of Mount Sinai, Moses ascended the 
mountain with great majesty, crowned with light. He would ascend a little and look be- 
hind him, blessing the congregation. When he reached the top he saw that a cloud was 
floating there. As he came closer, the cloud opened, and Moses stepped inside, and the 
cloud carried him on high. Inside of that cloud, Moses was hidden from the sight of the 
Congregation of Israel, and they cried out in distress. But Moses knew that he had been 
sanctified, and that he was being borne up by God's blessing, as it is said. And Moses went 
up to God (Exod. 19:3). 

As the cloud rose up, Moses lost track of time, so filled was he with awe. Then all at once 
the cloud stopped at the gates of the firmament, and the mouth of the cloud opened, and 
Moses sought to enter the Gate of Heaven. But the angel Kemuel, who guards that gate, 
rebuked Moses, saying, "How dare you come here! Have you no fear of the angels and their 
fire?" When Moses replied: "I have come to receive the Torah," the gate opened of its own 
accord, for the Torah is the key that opens that gate. And when the angel saw this, he knew 
that it was God's wish that Moses should enter there, and he made way for him to pass. 

After that Moses reached the river Rigyon, a river of fire whose coals can consume 
angels as well as men. There he was met by a troop of the Angels of Destruction, who 
gathered around Moses in order to consume him with fire. And Moses cried out: "Master 
of the Universe, keep them from consuming me with their fiery breath!" At that moment 
a great fiery wave rose up from the river and washed over the Angels of Destruction, and 
they were all consumed. But not a spark of that fire touched Moses, who learned in this 
way that all things exist by the mercy of God, and that every life is in His hands. 

Now when the angels saw Moses there, they cried out to God: "Master of the Uni- 
verse, what is this man doing here?" And God replied: "He has come to receive the To- 
rah." And the angels said: "You created the Torah before You created the world. How can 
such a precious treasure pass into the hands of a mere human being?" And God replied: 
"It was created for that very purpose." 

Then God reached down and pulled Moses up to His heavenly throne. There Moses 
saw God seated on his Throne of Glory, and behind Him was an angel so large that 
Moses shook with terror. Then God stepped down from His Throne of Glory to comfort 
him. And in the Divine Presence, Moses found his strength again, and he grew calm in 
that high place. 

When he had recovered, Moses asked to know the identity of that angel, and God 
replied: "That is the angel Sandalphon, who wreaths garlands out of the prayers of Is- 
rael." Just then Sandalphon completed one of those garlands, and it rose up on its own 
accord and came to rest on the head of God as He sat on His Throne of Glory. And at that 
moment all the hosts on high shook with awe, and the wheels of the throne revolved, and 
the creatures of the chariot, which had been silent, began to roar like lions, all of them 
crying out Holy, holy, holy! The Lord of Hosts (Isa. 6:3). 

Then God said to Moses: "The time has come for you to receive the Torah. Take hold of 
My Throne of Glory — it will protect you from the angels." This Moses did, and all at once 
God opened the seven firmaments and showed Moses the Sanctuary on high. Then He 
opened the portals of the seven firmaments and appeared over Israel, in all His fullness 
and splendor. And when the children of Israel heard the words "I the Lord am your God " 
(Exod. 20:2), they fell down in fear and their souls departed. Then God caused the dew of 
the resurrection, which will revive the souls of the righteous at the End of Days, to fall 
upon them. And every one of them was revived. 



262 MYTHS OF THE HOLY WORD 


After that God sent one hundred and twenty myriads of angels to earth, two angels 
for each of the children of Israel. One angel to put its hand over each of their hearts, so 
that it would not stop beating, and the other raised up their heads, so they could g aze at 
God in that moment of Glory. And so they did. 

Then, while the portals were still open, God transmitted the Torah to Moses, while 
every word echoed among the people gathered below. For forty days and nights God 
spoke the words of the Torah to Moses during the day, and at night He explained it to 
him. And that which he wrote down during the day is the Written Law, and that which 
he learned at night is the Oral Law, which reveals the seventy meanings of every word of 
the Torah, like the many facets of a perfect jewel. 

At the end of forty days and nights, the cloud returned, and Moses descended to Mount 
Sinai. And there he proclaimed the sovereignty of the Lord over all of Israel, and that The 
Lord shall reign forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. Hallelujah (Ps. 146:10). 

The ascent of Elijah into heaven is stated explicitly in the Bible: As they kept on 
walking and talking, a fiery chariot with fiery horses suddenly appeared and separated one 
from the other, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind (2 Kings 2:11). In the case of 
Moses, one verse of the Torah is interpreted to mean that such an ascent took place: 

And Moses went up to God (Exod. 19:3). Thus, while the account in the Torah states that 
Moses ascended to the top of Mount Sinai to receive the Torah, the verse And Moses 
went up to God is interpreted to mean that Moses ascended all the way into heaven to 
receive the Torah. This interpretation gave birth to a wide range of myths about what 
took place during the ascent. In one version, Moses is said to have been sent by God to 
sit in the future classroom of Rabbi Akiba. But most accounts describe the encounters 
Moses has in heaven, struggling with the angels and viewing the wonders of Para- 
dise. These myths follow the pattern found in the Hekhalot texts about heavenly jour- 
neys, dating from the first to the eighth centuries. Thus the ascent of Moses may well 
have served as the model for some of these Hekhalot texts. The third major ascent in 
Jewish tradition is that of Enoch, found in the books of Enoch, of which 3 Enoch itself 
is a Hekhalot text. 

It was widely assumed in rabbinic literature that Moses not only climbed to the top 
of Mount Sinai to receive the Torah, but that he also ascended into Paradise. Inevita- 
bly, Moses encountered the angels, who had never been enthusiastic about the cre- 
ation of humans in the first place, and were loath to see the Torah transmitted to him. 

The angels attempted to obstruct Moses and cast him out of heaven, but God always 
interceded to protect him. There are several versions of this legend of heavenly as- 
cent. That in Pesikta Rabbati is the most extensive. Among the prophets, Moses was the 
only one said to have seen God. In these legends of the ascent of Moses, he stands 
before the Throne of Glory, sees God weaving the crowns of the letters of the Torah, 
and, most amazingly, there is an account of God stepping down from His Throne of 
Glory to reassure Moses, who has been frightened by the awe-inspiring sight of the 
angel Sandalphon. Subsequent prophets hear the voice of God, but visions of God are 
extremely rare. See, for example, "The Vision of the High Priest," which recounts the 
High Priest's vision of Akatriel Yah in the Holy of Holies. 

There is an interesting debate in the Talmud, B. Sukkah 5a, as to whether or not God 
descended to earth and whether Moses and Elijah really ascended to heaven. This 
grows out of the assertion that "Neither Moses nor Elijah ever went up to heaven, nor 
did the Shekhinah come down to earth." This anti-mythological belief is based on the 
verse The heavens belong to God, but the earth He gave over to humanity (Ps. 115:16). One 
side argues that the verse Yahweh came doom upon Mount Sinai (Exod. 19:20) is evi- 
dence that God did descend to earth. As proof that Moses did ascend to heaven, they 
select Moses went up to God (Exod. 19:3). The other side argues that God only came 
within ten handbreadths of the earth, and that Moses and Elijah only reached within 
ten handbreadths below the sphere of heaven. 



COD OFFERS THE TORAH TO ISRAEL 263 


Hakham Yosef Hayim of Baghdad, known as Ben Ish Hai, comments about the 
protests of the angels when Moses ascended on high, that most of the angels did not 
protest, and the few who did were inspired by God to do so. He argues that God 
engineered the confrontation with the angels so that all would see Moses emerge vic- 
torious.

328. MOUNT SINAI IS LIFTED TO HEAVEN 

Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God. And Mount Sinai was uprooted 
from its place and lifted up above the earth. And the heavens were opened and the sum- 
mit of the mountain came into their midst, and the Lord was revealed. 

Here the revelation at Sinai is described in even greater mythic terms than are found 
in the Torah. In an unparalleled series of events, God raises up Mount Sinai to the 
heavens, and at that instant, with the heavens open, God is revealed to the people. 

A parallel myth, but with much different implications, describes God as lifting up 
Mount Sinai and holding it over the heads of the people of Israel at the time. He asked 
them if they were willing to receive the Torah, and with no other choice, they readily 
agreed to receive it. See "God Offers the Torah to Israel," p. 264.

329. HOW GOD REVEALED HIMSELF AT MOUNT SINAI 

God did not reveal Himself on Mount Sinai like hailstones falling from heaven. Instead, 
He appeared slowly and gradually, moving from one mountaintop to the next until He 
descended upon Mount Sinai. 

But our forebears, standing at Mount Sinai to accept the Torah, saw no form resem- 
bling a human being, nor resembling the form of any creature, nor resembling the form 
of anything that has breath that God created on the face of the earth. They saw only God, 
the one God, whose kingdom endures in heaven and on earth, as it is said. For the Lord 
your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords (Deut. 10:17). 

This midrash presents Maimonides's interpretation of the verses, Yahweh came from 
Sinai and rose from Mount Seir to them; He shone forth from Mount Paran and He came from 
holy multitudes (Deut. 33:2). Likewise, Rashi agrees that God did not appear on Mount 
Sinai suddenly, but revealed Himself little by little. 

Eliyahu Rabbah offers the paradoxical view that those at Mount Sinai "saw no form 
resembling a human being." At the same time, they saw God, who, according to this 
text, was not in a human image, despite Genesis 1:26, In the image of God He created them, 
and the extensive tradition linked to this verse. The theological purpose of insisting that 



264 MYTHS OF THE HOLY WORD 


the people saw no human form is to oppose the anthropomorphic tendencies in Juda- 
ism, and to reaffirm the tradition that God cannot be represented by an image. 

Yet both texts represented here do insist that the people saw something — they saw 
God, but what they saw cannot be described in human terms.

Iggeret Teiman 142-143; Eliyahu Rabbah 1:6. 


330. GOD OFFERS THE TORAH TO ISRAEL 

Some say that from the time of Creation until Israel went out of Egypt, God went around 
offering the Torah to each and every nation, but they all refused to accept it. That is when 
God offered it to Israel. 

Others say that God created the world with a stipulation: "If Israel accepts the Torah 
when it is offered to them, all of creation will continue to exist. Otherwise I will return the 
world to chaos and void." 

So when the children of Israel had gathered at Mount Sinai, And they took their places at 
the foot of the mountain (Exod. 19:17), God overturned the mountain like an inverted bar- 
rel, and held it above their heads and said: "If you accept the Torah, all will be well. If not, 
you will be buried here." 

That is when Israel declared its willingness to accept the Torah. 

This midrash emphasizes the utterly essential role of Israel in God's plan of Cre- 
ation. Here God declares at the beginning of the time of Creation that it is contingent on 
Israel s acceptance of the Torah. This leads to the grotesque image of God forcing Israel 
to accept the Torah by holding Mount Sinai over their heads. This account derives from 
a very literal interpretation of the verse And they took their places at the foot of the mountain 
(Exod. 19:17). In some versions, God first offers the Torah to every other nation, and 
each one turns it down. When He comes to Israel, the last nation to be asked, and holds 
the mountain oyer their heads, of course they say yes. What they actually say is "We will 
do and we will listen (Exod. 24: 7). We will do" refers to following God's command- 
ments, the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. "We will listen" refers to studying the Torah with 
great intensity. This myth, then, personifies the "yoke" of the Law: it illustrates the com- 
pelling nature of Jewish law to those who observe it. According to B. Shabbat 88a, as a 
reward for saying "We will do and we will listen," 600,000 angels descended from heaven 
and tied two crowns, one for "do" and the other for "listen," to the head of every Jew. 

Still, some commentaries attempt to reinterpret this midrash where the mountain 
held over the head of the people serves as a metaphor for the revelation of God's 
infinite love for them (Likutei Torah). At the same time, if God forced Israel to accept 
the Torah at Mount Sinai, it was indeed an agreement made under coercion, and it 
was not until the time of Mordecai and Esther that the Jewish people truly accepted 
the Torah of their own free choice: The Jews undertook and irrevocably obligated them- 
selves and their descendants, and all who might join them, to observe these two days in the 
manner prescribed and at the proper time each year (Esther 9:27). 

The giant Og is also said to have uprooted a mountain and held it over the heads of 
the Israelites (B. Ber. 54b). See "The Giant Og," p. 461. 

Hakham Yosef Hayim of Baghdad, known as Ben Ish Hai, links this midrash with 
the Oral Torah. In his view, the Israelites had already accepted the Written Torah when 
they said. We will do and we will listen (Exod. 24:7). But God had to coerce them to 
accept the Oral Law. That is why He held the mountain over their heads. Further, God 
hollowed out the mountain like a barrel to teach them that each letter of the Written 
Torah contains innumerable interpretations in the Oral Law, just as a barrel contains 
innumerable drops of wine. Thus God was demanding that their acceptance of the 
Written Law include their acceptance of the Oral Law. This is an interesting and origi- 
nal interpretation of this bizarre midrash about God offering the Torah to Israel. 



COD OFFERS THE TORAH TO ISRAEL 265 


The continued existence of the world was dependent on Israel's acceptance of the 
Torah. God said, "If Israel accepts the Torah, the world will continue to exist. But if 
not, I will reduce the world to a state of chaos" (B. Avodah Zarah 3a). According to this 
myth, not only the continued existence of Israel was at stake, but the continued exist- 
ence of the world. Nor, according to Rabbi Hayim of Volozhin, must the study of the 
Torah around the globe ever cease, even for a split second. If this should happen, all 
the worlds above and below would revert to nothingness ( Nefesh ha-Hayim 4:1).

331. GOD TEARS APART SEVEN FIRMAMENTS 

During the revelation of the Torah, as all Israel watched, God tore apart seven firmaments, 
one after the other, to show the people that there is no other God beside Him. 

At the end of the Yom Kippur service, the Shema is read, and the phrase, "The Lord 
is God" is repeated seven times. The explanation for this repetition is that God tore 
apart seven firmaments to demonstrate to Israel that there were no other gods. God is 
said to dwell above the seven firmaments. 

An alternate explanation is that those who prayed in the presence of the Shekhinah 
are reluctant to let Her go, and they accompany Her through the seven firmaments.

332. THE PRIMORDIAL TORAH 

The primordial Torah was written with black fire on white fire. It was fire mixed with 
fire, cut from fire, given from fire. God peered into the fiery letters of that Torah and 
created the world. 

At last the time came for the Torah to be given to Moses at Mount Sinai. From the top 
of the mountain, Moses peered into the heavens, and there he had a vision in which he 
saw the letters burning in black fire on white. The first letters to take form were those of 
God's Name, YHVH. Then the rest of the alphabet emerged. The letters danced, joining 
into hundreds of permutations of the names of God. Then the letters formed themselves 
into one long Name. This Name was none other than the letters of the Torah, for the 
entire Torah is a single, holy, mystical Name. 

There Moses read the Torah for the first time, and as he read each word, he heard the 
voice of God speaking it. Later Moses wrote everything down, exactly as he had heard it, 
and that is how the primordial Torah was transmitted to Israel. 

The primordial Torah is known as Torah Kedumah. This primordial Torah was one 
of the seven things created before the creation of the world. The image of the Torah 
being written in black fire on white, found in the Talmud and recurring in the Zohar , 
serves as an archetype for the primordial Torah. The notion of God looking into the 
Torah to create the world is found in Genesis Rabbah 1:1: "Thus God consulted the 
Torah and created the world." Here God is portrayed as an architect and the Torah a 
blueprint in the creation of the world. See "Seven Things Created before the Creation 
of the World," p. 74. The way the letters of the alphabet emerge and combine has an 
uncanny resemblance to the combining and recombining of strings of DNA.

266 MYTHS OF THE HOLY WORD 


333. THE FIRST TABLETS 

The first stone tablets of the Law were created by God Himself on the eve of the first 
Sabbath. AH of the heavenly angels gathered together to see how the tablets were written 
with the finger of Cod (Exod. 31 :18) with black fire on white fire. As a result, the letters were 
visible through either side, for God had made them that way. The entire Torah was con- 
tained on those tablets. Some say that the first tablets were hewn from the foundation 
stone at the center of the world, while others say that they were made of sapphire taken 
from beneath the Throne of Glory. 

In origin, the first tablets were completely spiritual. How, then, was it possible for God 
to give them to Moses? Some say that at the instant the tablets were given to Moses by the 
hand of God, they assumed material form, and became stone tablets. Others say that they 
were made in the primordial light at the time of Creation, and descended from heaven in 
two stone tablets. 

Satan employed all his wiles to prevent Israel from receiving the first tablets from 
Moses. Had Israel received them, death would have disappeared forever, as would Satan's 
power over the people. To make them lose hope, Satan showed the people the bier of 
Moses suspended in the air, and they saw themselves as Moses' pallbearers. This led to 
the creation of the golden calf. 

The tablets that Moses went to heaven to receive had been written on the sixth day of 
Creation and had been waiting for him ever since. Before Moses, Enoch had ascended on 
high and had read everything written on the heavenly tablets, all the deeds of mankind 
to the remotest generations. 

When Moses descended from Mount Sinai and discovered the tribes of Israel wor- 
shipping the golden calf, he cast down the tablets of the Law and broke them at the foot 
of the mountain. This caused all the grief that Israel has experienced ever since, includ- 
ing the experience of death itself. For had the first tablets survived, every sorrow and 
calamity would have disappeared from the earth, and the world would have experi- 
enced freedom from the Angel of Death. It was God's intention for the Jewish people to 
attain freedom from death because of their acceptance of the Torah. But as a result of their 
idolatry, God decided that the people would remain mortal. So too would the second set 
of commandments differ from the first, for a set of laws designed for immortal people 
was no longer appropriate for them. 

How did the two sets of tablets differ? God inscribed the first set of tablets, Moses the 
second. No one knows what was written on the first tablets, but it is said that if the first 
tablets had not been broken, Jews would never have forgotten any Torah they had learned. 
Some say that all the commandments on the first set were positive, while more than half 
of those of the second set are negative. For God saw that people could not be trusted to 
follow positive commandments, and therefore He put in the negative ones. Also, great 
secrets were revealed to Israel when the first tablets were given. But after the sin of the 
golden calf, Israel was no longer worthy of knowing those secrets. Therefore, they were 
forced to forget them. 

There are those who say that the first tablets were not engraved, but the letters flut- 
tered on them in black fire superimposed on white fire. So that the instant Moses threw 
down the tablets, the letters took flight before the tablets broke against the ground. Oth- 
ers say that the letters took flight as Moses approached the border of the camp, where the 
golden calf was being worshipped, a place of defilement and transgression. Thus the 
letters took flight even before Moses cast down the tablets. 



COD OFFERS THE TORAH TO ISRAEL 267 


Why, then, did Moses smash the tablets? Some say that he smashed them out of anger 
at the sight of idolatry. Others say Moses did not shatter the tablets on his own, but only 
at God's command. Still others say that the letters suddenly took flight, and as soon as 
they did, the tablets became far too heavy for Moses to carry, and they fell from his arms 
and shattered. 

The idea of writings that exist in heaven is found among the ancient peoples of the 
Mideast. The belief in tablets of fate, inscribed in heaven, is of Babylonian origin. In 
the Jewish view, God was not only the author of the Torah, but inscribed the first 
tablets Himself, in black fire on white fire, using His finger. There is a similar Islamic 
belief about a heavenly Koran that is the model for the earthly one. 

One tradition holds that the Torah, engraved in its entirety on these tablets, was 
created before the creation of the world. The existence of tablets of heaven is reported 
in 1 Enoch , when the angel Uriel says to Enoch: "Enoch, look at the tablets of heaven; 
read what is written upon them ... So I looked at the tablets of heaven, read all the 
writings on them, and came to understand everything." In Hekhalot Rabbati 6:3, all the 
trials foreordained for Israel are said to be recorded on heavenly tablets. Fragment B 
of the Prayer of Joseph states that "I have read in the tablets of heaven all that shall 
befall you and your sons." In 3 Enoch 41, the angel Metatron shows Rabbi Ishmael 
"the letters by which heaven and earth were created . . . engraved with a pen of flame 
upon the Throne of Glory." In The Book of Jubilees Jacob is said to have seen an angel 
descending from heaven with seven tablets in his hand, and he gives them to Jacob, 
who read what was written there, and learned what would happen to him and his 
sons. The Book of Jubilees also recounts that Enoch gave these heavenly tablets to his 
descendants. 

Deuteronomy Rabbah states that the first tablets were the work of God, while the 
second set were hewn by Moses, made at God's command (Exod. 34:1). But were the 
first tablets identical to the second? Most commentators conclude that they were not. 

The Talmud, in B. Shabbat 146a, asserts that the residual pollutant of the original ser- 
pent had been expunged from the people, and that God intended to remove death. 

Thus the commandments of the first tablets were for immortals, not for mortals. But 
when the people turned to idolatry, they lost the gift of immortality. Thus the com- 
mandments of the second tablets were, by necessity, different. 

Considering the consequences of smashing the tablets, why did Moses do it? Rabbi 
Hayim ben Attar suggests that he was convinced that by the destruction he would 
perform something infinitely more useful than that which he destroyed. Avot de~Rabbi 
Natan states that Moses did not shatter the tablets until told to do so by God. 

Concerning the rays of light that shone from the face of Moses when he descended 
Mount Sinai, see "The Divine Radiance," p. 389.

334. THE SECOND TABLETS 

The Lord said to Moses: "Carve two tablets of stone like the first, and I will inscribe upon 
the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you shattered. Be ready by 
morning, and in the morning come up to Mount Sinai and present yourself there to Me, 
on the top of the mountain. No one else shall come up with you, and no one else shall be 
seen anywhere on the mountain; neither shall the flocks and the herds graze at the foot of 
this mountain. So Moses carved two tablets of stone, like the first, and early in the morning 
he went up on Mount Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him, taking the two stone 
tablets with him. The Lord came down in a cloud; He stood with him there, and pro- 
claimed the name of the Lord. The Lord passed before him and proclaimed: "The Lord! 
The Lord! A God compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in kindness and 
faithfulness, extending kindness to the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity, trans- 
gression, and sin; yet He does not remit all punishment, but visits the iniquity of parents 
upon children and children's children, upon the third and fourth generations." 

Moses hastened to bow low to the ground in homage, and said, "If I have gained Your 
favor, O Lord, pray, let the Lord go in our midst, even though this is a stiff-necked people. 
Pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your own!" 

God said: "I hereby make a covenant. Before all your people I will work such wonders 
as have not been wrought on all the earth or in any nation; and all the people who are 
with you shall see how awe-inspiring are the Lord's deeds which I will perform for you." 

On descending Mount Sinai after receiving the Torah, Moses saw the people of 
Israel worshipping a golden calf and in his anger and disgust smashed the tablets on 
which the Torah was inscribed. Here God directs Moses to carve a second set of tab- 
lets. Since there were two sets, rabbinic texts wondered greatly whether the first rev- 
elation at Sinai was different from the second, and many myths hold that there were 
considerable differences between them. See "The First Tablets," p. 266.

Exodus 34:1-10 


335. THE FIRST TORAH 

God told the Prince of the Presence, "Write for Moses from the beginning of Creation 
until My sanctuary has been built for all eternity. Then everyone will know that I am the 
Lord of Israel and the Father of all the children of Jacob and King upon Mount Zion for 
all eternity." 

This striking myth from The Book of Jubilees runs contrary to the general belief that 
God dictated the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai, and that Moses wrote it down. Here 
God commands the angel of the Presence (who is referred to in later sources as 
Metatron) to write down the history of the world from the beginning to the End of 
Days. The reference to God's sanctuary being built for eternity may refer to the Temple 
in Jerusalem, which was to be rebuilt in the time of the Messiah. Or it could refer to 
the myth that the heavenly Temple will descend to earth in the messianic era. Since 
the Torah does not end with a vision of the coming of the Messiah, the myth in Jubilees 
makes another substantial change in the biblical narrative. Here Moses has all past 
and future history revealed to him much as does Adam when he reads The Book of 
Raziel, and his experience on Mount Sinai becomes more of a vision and less of a 40 
days and nights dictation from God. 

This myth also suggests the tradition that Moses received the Torah through the 
angels. Thus the angel serves as the intermediary in bringing the Torah to mankind. 



COD OFFERS THE TORAH TO ISRAEL 269 


much as the angel Raziel delivers The Book ofRaziel to Adam. See "The Book of Raziel/' 
p. 253. The theme of angels as intermediaries is found in Zechariah, who receives all 
his communications through angels, as well as in Daniel.

336. HOW THE TEN COMMANDMENTS WERE GIVEN 

The first word that went forth from the mouth of God was like shooting stars and light- 
ning and fiery torches, a torch to the right and a torch to the left. It flew and winged 
swiftly through the heavens and came back. All Israel saw it and was filled with fear. 
And it came back and hovered over the camps of Israel, and returning, it became en- 
graved on the tablets of the covenant and all Israel beheld it. Then it cried out, "I Yahweh 
am your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, the house of bondage" (Exod. 20:2). 

Each and every subsequent word that came forth from God's mouth was like the first, 
shooting stars and fiery torches winging swiftly through the air, as each one of the Ten 
Commandments was given. 

This is an elaborate description of the effects of God pronouncing the Ten Com- 
mandments. All of Israel witnessed a single word that appears like a shooting star 
and hovers over the people like a flying saucer, and then returns to be graven in the 
tablets of the Law. This underscores the centrality and importance of the Ten Com- 
mandments, and emphasizes the world-shaking nature of the event of their being 
given.

Targum Neophyti on Exodus 20:1. 


337. THE ORDER OF THE TORAH 

The order of the Torah as we know it is not correct. For if the sections of the Torah had 
been given in the correct order, the precise reward and punishment for each command- 
ment would be known. Further, anyone who read them would have unlimited powers. 
They would be able to wake the dead and perform miracles. That is why the true order 
and arrangement of the Torah was hidden and is known only to God. 

This rabbinic myth seems to foreshadow the concept of practical kabbalah, where 
knowledge of the mysteries was used to accomplish specific magical purposes, such 
as raising the dead or ascending on high. It is here that kabbalah and magic combine 
into one pursuit. The implication is that the order of the separate portions of the Torah 
itself was a powerful mystery, which is so secret that only God knows it. Here no 
other, angel or human, is said to share this secret, not even Moses, to whom the Torah 
was dictated by God. For if these sections were arranged in the true order, they would 
endow the possessor of this secret with unlimited, divine powers. Another parallel 
interpretation suggests that the words and letters of the Torah spell out the secret 
Name of God, which, if it were known, would convey divine power to whoever knew 
how to pronounce it.

270 MYTHS OF THE HOLY WORD 


338. GOD ABROGATES THE FIRST DECREE 

When God created the world. He first decreed, "The heavens belong to Yahweh, but the earth 
He gave over to man " (Ps. 115:16). But when God decided to give the Torah, He abrogated 
the first decree and declared: "Let the earthly beings ascend on high, and the heavenly 
creatures descend below" as it is said, Yahweh came down upon Mount Sinai (Exod. 19:20), 
and it is also written. Then He said to Moses: Come up to the Lord (Exod. 24:1). 

Based on this midrash, it would appear that not all of God's decrees are immu- 
table. This myth describes how at the beginning of time God and His heavenly retinue 
were entirely separated from the earthly realm by God's decree. But the Giving of the 
Torah was such a cosmic event that it overcame the separation between the heavenly 
and the earthly realms. Henceforth, God and the angels descended to earth, while 
earthly beings, such as Moses, were able to ascend to heaven. See "The Ascent of 
Moses," p. 261.

Midrash Tanhuma-Yelammedenu, va-Yera 15 


339. THE GIVING OF THE TORAH 

God originally planned to give the Torah after a thousand generations. Later He saw that 
the world could not exist that long without the Torah. Therefore He gave the Torah to the 
twenty-sixth generation. 

Before God gave the Torah, He repeated it to Himself four times. When God gave the 
Torah, no bud chirped or flew, no cattle lowed, the angels did not take wing, the sea did not 
move, no person spoke. The entire world remained silent and listened as God's voice pro- 
claimed, I Yahweh am your God (Exod. 20:2). The sound of God's voice went forth from one 
end of the world to the other. All the pagan kings were seized with trembling in their palaces. 

Here God's giving of the Torah is described as an event that took place long before 
God intended it, as the need for the Torah was too great to wait a thousand genera- 
tions, as God originally planned. The actual giving of the Torah is described almost as 
a presentation, in which God prepared himself by repeating it to Himself four times. 

These elements portray God as very humanlike, first changing his mind about when 
to give the Torah and then rehearsing the presentation as a human would. And during 
the actual giving of the Torah, God had a rapt audience, as the whole world remained 
silent and listened to God's voice. 

While the biblical account of the giving of the Torah makes it quite explicit that it 
was direct communication from God to Moses, The Book of Jubilees 1:27-28 has God 
direct the Angel of the Presence— who is elsewhere identified as Metatron— to serve 
as an intermediary, telling the angel to "Write for Moses from the first of creation until 
My sanctuary is built in their midst."

340. MOSES BEFORE THE THRONE OF GLORY 

When Moses ascended Mount Sinai to receive the Torah, he did not stop at the top of the 
mountain, but God sent down a cloud, which Moses entered, and the cloud carried him 



THE 6WNC OF THE TORAH 271 


aloft, all the way into heaven. As he was ascending into Paradise, the angels saw him 
entering their realm, where none of the living were permitted, and they sought to throw 
him out. Moses became very frightened and called out to God, for he was afraid that the 
angels would consume him with their fiery breath. And God reached down and pulled 
Moses all the way up to the highest heaven, to the Throne of Glory. There Moses found 
himself face to face with God, and he saw that God was affixing crowns to the letters of 
the Torah. And Moses said to God, "What are You doing?" And God replied, I am adding 
these crowns to the letters of the Torah, for in the future there will be a man bom whose 
name will be Akiba ben Joseph, full of the spirit of knowledge, wisdom, and understand- 
ing, and he will interpret every crown and letter of the Torah." Moses said, "I would like 
to see him." And God, for whom nothing is impossible, said, "Turn around." So Moses 
turned around, and he found himself more than a thousand years in the future, seated in 
the eighth row of Rabbi Akiba's classroom, and Rabbi Akiba was explaining a point of 
the Law. Moses listened carefully, but he could not understand what he heard. Finally, a 
student raised his hand and said, "Rabbi Akiba, where do we know this from?" And 
Rabbi Akiba said, "We know this from Moses at Mount Sinai." 

Here Moses is sent by God to sit in the classroom of Rabbi Akiba. The fact that 
Akiba lived over a thousand years after Moses presents no problems in the Aggadah , 
where time is subordinate to the will of God. Moses finds Akiba's teachings difficult 
to follow and is doubtless astonished when Akiba quotes Moses himself as the source 
of his teaching. It seems likely that in this legend we find a kind of secret confession of 
the rabbis, acknowledging that the later generations had so transformed the meaning 
of the Torah that Moses must turn to his successor. Rabbi Akiba, for a complete under- 
standing of the law that he himself transmitted. 

Indeed, there is a related rabbinic tradition that while Moses did receive all of the 
Oral Law at Mount Sinai, including all future interpretations of the Torah, he did not 
write all of it down, but left some of it to be discovered by the future generations. This 
seems like an acknowledgment that the very essence of the rabbinic commentary on 
the Torah required a creative process of discovery.

341. GOD TEACHES TORAH IN THE WORLD TO COME 

God said to Abraham: "You taught your sons Torah in this world, but in the World to 
Come I Myself will teach Torah to all of Israel, and they will not forget it, for I will write 
it in their hearts. Then all of Israel will become prophets, as it is said, 'After that , I will pour 
out my spirit on all flesh; your sons and daughters shall prophesy ; your old men shall dream 
dreams, and your young men shall see visions' " (Joel 3:1). 

This tradition of God teaching Torah in the World to Come to the souls of the righ- 
teous is based on an interpretation of And all your children shall be disciples of the Lord , 
and great shall be the happiness of your children (Isa. 54:13). It is also based on Jeremiah 
31:32: "After those days," said Yahweh, "I will put my Torah in their inward parts and write 
it in their hearts. " Here "after those days" is understood to mean after this lifetime, in the 
time of the World to Come, as does "afterward" in the verse from Joel 3:1. See "The 
Celestial Academy," p. 193.

272 MYTHS OF THE HOLY WORD 


342. MOSES QUESTIONS GOD 

God dictated the Torah to Moses at Mount Sinai, and Moses transcribed the Torah exactly 
as he heard it from God. But when God dictated the words, " Let us make man in our image" 
(Gen. 1:26), Moses paused and inquired of God, "Master of the Universe, how is it that 
You are providing an opening for heretics? I am bewildered about this." 

God replied, "Write as I instruct you, and whoever wishes to err may err." 

This midrash reflects the rabbinic discomfort with the "us" in, "Let us make man" 
which they regarded as an opening to heretics. So here they project their concern by 
putting it in the mouth of Moses. God's reply is that Moses simply serves as His scribe 
and must write down what He tells him. 

The difficulties presented by this passage are addressed directly in B. Sanhedrin 
38b: "In all the passages which the heretics have taken as proofs, their refutation is 
near at hand. Thus: 'Let us make man in our image ' is refuted by And God created man in 
His image (Gen. 1:27), and ' Let us, then, go down and confound their speech there ' (Gen. 

11:7) is refuted by. And the Lord came down" (Gen. 11:7).

343. THE ARK OF THE COVENANT 

As long as the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord traveled in front of them (Num. 10:33), the way 
was made easy for the children of Israel, for the Ark lifted up every valley and sank 
down every mountain, so that they might go on their way. 

Just as Miriam's Well accompanied the Israelites wherever they went in the wilder- 
ness, so that they always had fresh water, so too was the Ark of the Covenant said to 
have raised up every valley and lowered every mountain, making it easier for them to 
proceed. See "Miriam's Well," p. 387.

344. THE CHANGING TORAH 

The sages say that in the future God will give a new Torah. If God wants to change the 
Torah or exchange it for another, to descend once more on Mount Sinai or another mighty 
mountain, and to appear a second time before the eyes of all the living— we must do His 
will, whatever His bidding. 

Maimonides insisted that the entire Torah was unchanging. That meant, for ex- 
ample, that the claims of Christianity and Islam that they offered new divine revela- 
tions were inevitably false. Here, however. Rabbi Jacob Emden (1697-1776) offers the 
possibility that God could provide a new revelation, different from the first at Sinai, 
and if so it would be the duty of the people of Israel to do God's bidding, no matter 
what it was. At the same time, Emden is making it clear that it would have to be a 
major revelation, as great as that at Sinai, in order to be recognized as replacing the 
old Torah. Emden was the archenemy of the Shabbatian messianic movement, and 



THE (HAN6IN6 TORAH 273 


there is an element of irony in this explanation, implying that it is unlikely that such a 
major new revelation would ever occur; certainly not in the case of Shabbatai Zevi, 
who later proved himself to be a false Messiah. 

That rabbinic interpretations of the Torah had changed it in a substantial way is 
reflected in a dream of Rabbi Yitzhak Eizik Safrin of Komamo (1806-1874) found in 
his dream book, Megillat Setarim. In a dream from 1847, Rabbi Safrin writes, "I dreamed 
I saw a Torah scroll, and between every verse were written great and exalted secrets. I 
stood there with my teacher and master, my uncle Tzvi. He showed me this scroll and 
told me that this was my scroll that I had written with my teachings and new interpre- 
tations."

345. THE FLYING LETTERS 

Before the world was created, the letters of the alphabet flew around without order, and 
nothing existed except chaos. To bring order out of chaos, God arranged the letters of the 
alphabet, beginning with aleph. Then God chose bet, the second letter, to begin the Torah 
and brought the Torah into being. After that, each of the letters took its place in the Torah. 
There are said to be 600,000 letters, the same number as the Israelites assembled at Mount 
Sinai to receive the Torah. 

The Torah tells how the first tablets were engraved with God's finger. When Moses 
saw the golden calf. He hurled the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the 
mountain (Exod. 32:19). It is said of the letters inscribed on those tablets that they took 
flight and ascended on high. Ever since, the letters of the Torah have taken flight in times 
of danger. 

The Talmud tells of Rabbi Haninah ben Teradion, who was wrapped in the scroll of 
the Torah and set on fire, for daring to study the Torah in public in Rome, when it was 
forbidden. His disciples called out, "Rabbi what do you see?" Rabbi Haninah answered, 
"The parchment is burning, but the letters are soaring on high." 

The Zohar tells that not long after the death of Shimon bar Yohai, Rabbi Judah fell 
asleep beneath a tree, and in a dream he saw Rabbi Shimon ascending on high, bearing a 
scroll of the Torah in his arms. Behind him flew a flock in formation. Then Rabbi Judah 
looked closer and saw that it was not a flock of birds but a flock of flying letters that 
followed Rabbi Shimon. At first. Rabbi Judah was mystified. Then he suddenly under- 
stood that what he was seeing was a book of flying letters that Rabbi Shimon was taking 
up with him. And in the dream. Rabbi Judah watched them ascend until they disap- 
peared. When Rabbi Judah awoke and remembered this dream, he knew that when Rabbi 
Shimon had died, the world had lost the precious store of his wisdom. For now that book 
of celestial mysteries had returned to its place on high. 

The motif of flying letters is found in many variations in Jewish lore. The earliest 
examples of this theme are found in rabbinic lore concerning the Tablets of the Law 
shattered by Moses in Exodus 32:19. The myth explains that before the tablets struck 
the ground, the letters ascended on high (Avot de-Rabbi Natan 2:11). 

The other famous tale about flying letters concerns the execution of Haninah ben 
Teradion, who was wrapped in the scroll of the Torah. When asked what he saw as the 
flames burned, he replied: "The parchments are being burnt but the letters are soaring 
on high" (B. A. Z. 18a). 



274 MYTHS OF THE HOLY WORD 


The Zohar recounts a tale about a book of flying letters. It emphasizes how much 
the world lost at the time of the death of Shimon bar Yohai. Here Rabbi Judah has a 
dream in which he sees Bar Yohai ascending on high, followed by a flock of flying 
letters. These are the letters of the book of his wisdom, which has been lost due to his 
death. Rabbinic lore often recounts remarkable events that are said to have taken place 
when important rabbis have died.

346. GOD'S SIGNATURE 

After Israel built the golden calf and Moses had broken the tablets of the Law, Moses spoke 
to God and said: "Did You not bring them out of Egypt, out of the House of Idolatry?" 

God answered, "Do you want Me to become reconciled with them? Then bring new 
tablets and I will append My signature to them." 

God's signature, in the context of this midrash, refers to the rewriting of the second 
tablets. According to tradition, the first tablets of the Law were written by the finger 
of God, but the second were written by Moses. In this myth, God offers to add His 
signature to the second tablets, to make them official, as with the signing of a contract. 

Psalms 119:60 states that "The beginning of Your word is Truth," and according to 
B. Shabbat 55a, Truth is the signature of God." Drawing on this interpretation. Rabbi 
Yosef Hayim of Baghdad (1834-1909), known as Ben Ish Hai, states in Ben Yehoyada 
that God's signature is actually imprinted in the Torah, since the last letters of the first 
three words of the Torah spell emet, "truth."

347. THE CROWNS OF ISRAEL 


Six hundred thousand gathered at Mount Sinai to receive the Torah. When God asked 
them if they were ready to receive the Torah, they replied, "We will do and we will listen " 
(Exod. 24:7). And when they gave preference to "we will do" over "we will listen ," a heav- 
enly voice went forth and said: "Who has revealed this secret to my children, which is 
known by the angels, to do and then to listen?" Just then six hundred thousand minister- 
ing angels came down from on high and set two crowns upon each Israelite, one as a 
reward for "we will do" and one for "we will listen." 

But as soon as Israel sinned through the golden calf, twice as many destroying angels 
descended and snatched those crowns away. 

It is deduced that the angels know the secret of first doing and then listening be- 
cause of the verse. Bless the Lord, O His angels, mighty creatures who do His bidding , ever 
hearkening to His bidding; bless the Lord, all His hosts, His servants who do His will (Ps. 
103:20). Here, they first fulfill, then hearken. 

In Likutei Moharan 1:22 Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav interprets "do" to refer to the 
Revealed Torah (or Written Torah) and "listen" to refer to the Hidden Torah (or Oral 
Torah).

348. THE PRINCE OF THE TORAH 

After the return to Zion, the people set about rebuilding the Temple in Jerusalem. But 
they soon discovered that because of the effort required to rebuild the Temple, they no 
longer had time to study Torah, as God required of them. For God said, "You are to 
occupy yourselves with My Chosen House, and discussion of the Torah is never to leave 
your lips." Yet it seemed impossible to do both at the same time. 

When the builders complained to God about this, God first chastised them for not 
having studied more when they were in exile, depriving Him of hearing words of Torah 
from their lips. But then God informed the angels that He intended to reveal the secret of 
the Sar ha-Torah to the builders. With this secret, it was possible to acquire knowledge of 
the Torah and its secrets in a short time, without fear of forgetting them. 

When the angels heard this, they pleaded with God not to reveal this secret. "Do not 
make flesh and blood equal to us. Let them labor in the Torah as they have for genera- 
tions. If You reveal this secret to Your children, the small will be like the great, the fool 
like the wise man." 

But God dismissed the opinion of the angels and God Himself descended into the 
Temple as it was being built. When the builders saw the Throne of Glory hovering above 
the altar, with the King of the World on it, they fell upon their faces. Then God said, "My 
children, why are you prostrating yourselves? Rise and sit before My throne the way you 
sit in an academy, and learn the secret of how to lift up the paths of your mind to gaze 
into the Torah." Thus did God reveal to the builders the secret of how to call upon the Sar 
ha-Torah, the Prince of the Torah. 

This secret was first revealed to Moses, who used it to receive the Torah at Mount Sinai. 
Knowledge of this secret makes it possible to bring the Prince of the Torah down from on 
high by magical means, by the use of holy names, in order to reveal how to acquire vast 
knowledge of the Torah. After that the builders were able to busy themselves with building 
the Temple, and nonetheless the Torah did not depart from their lips. 

Rabbi Ishmael said of these builders: "Our fathers refused to set one stone on another 
in the Lord's temple until they convinced the King of the World and his servants to reveal 
to them the secret of the Torah." 

Sar ha-Torah is the Prince of the Torah, who is the Angel of the Torah. The angel's 
name is Yefefiah. The tradition concerning this angel states that when invoked, the 
angel reveals the secret of how to leam the Torah in one sitting. There is a series of 
accounts about those who invoked the Sar ha-Torah. But the primary myth concerns 
the inability of the builders of the Second Temple in Jerusalem to find time to study 
Torah. Here God Himself descends into the newly built Temple and reveals the secret 
of the Sar ha-Torah . The builders invoke the angel, rapidly leam the Torah, and this 
provides a reward both for God, Who revels in their study, and for themselves. 

In the text of Sar ha-Torah , God makes an assertion about those desiring ever more 
extensive teachings of the Torah: "I know what you want. You desire a great deal of 
Torah and much Talmud and many oral traditions. You crave My many secrets." Nor- 
mally, it takes a lifetime of study to master the extensive traditions linked to the To- 
rah, but through the miracle of the secret of the Prince of the Torah, it becomes possible 
to master this intricate study in a single sitting. This must have been a common fan- 
tasy among the students of the Torah.

349. STUDYING THE TORAH 

It is said about Rabbi Yonathan ben Uziel that when he was engaged in Torah study, 
every bird that flew over him was immediately burned up. 

When Rabbi Eleazar ben Arakh studied the Torah, fire descended from heaven and 
surrounded him. Angels danced as at a wedding party, and trees burst into song. 

Once, when Ben Azzai was studying Torah, there was a flame surrounding him. They 
asked: "Are you perhaps engaged in the study of the Mysteries of the Chariot?" He re- 
plied: "No, I am but finding in the Torah parallels to the Prophets, and in the Prophets 
parallels to the Aggadah. And the words of the Torah are joyful even as they were on the 
day they were given at Sinai, and they were originally given in fire, as it is said. The 
mountain was ablaze with flames" (Deut. 4:11). 

So too is a tale told of a devout man who died and appeared to his wife in a dream. His 
hair and beard were all lit up like a great torch. His wife realized that he had been wel- 
comed as a saint on high, and she said, "What have you done to be worthy of this?" He 
told her, "I tried to speak only of matters of the Torah, for God watches over those who 
devote themselves to Torah and speak as little as possible about anything else." 

Thus it is said that when one is properly engaged in Torah, those words of Torah as- 
cend on high, and they are hidden away in the Garden of Eden. And when God enters 
the Garden to delight in the righteous, those words are brought before Him, and He 
gazes at them and rejoices. 

While the subject that Rabbi Yonathan ben Uziel was studying is not given, both 
Rabbi Eleazar ben Arakh and Ben Azzai are linked to study of Ma'aseh Merkavah, the 
Mysteries of the Chariot. There is a considerable number of stories about rabbis who 
have miraculous experiences linked to study of these mysteries.

350. THE BOY WHO READ THE BOOK OF EZEKIEL 

There once was a certain child of exceptional understanding who read the Book of Ezekiel 
in his teacher's house. He contemplated the meaning of the word hashmal. He compre- 
hended the true meaning of the word hashmal in the passage, I looked , and lo, a stormy wind 
came sweeping out of the north— a huge cloud and flashing fire, surrounded by a radiance; and in 
the center of it, in the center of the fire , a gleam as of amber (hashmal) (Ezek. 1:4). At that instant 
a fire went forth and consumed him. 


This is a talmudic warning tale about the dangers of studying mystical texts, espe- 
cially the Book of Ezekiel. It highlights the mystery of the term hashmal in Ezekiel 1:4 
and underscores that the dangers of mystical study particularly apply to children.

351. THE TWO TORAHS 

There are two Torahs: the Written Torah and the Oral Torah. It is said that God dictated 
the Torah to Moses during the day, and at night He explained it to him. These explana- 
tions constitute the Oral Torah. 

Moses wanted to write down the whole Torah, but God told him that only certain 
parts could be written down, while other parts had to remain oral. 

All of the Torah had to be revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai so that no one could claim 
that only a part of the Torah had been given at the outset. But due to the immensity of all 
that Moses had to remember, at first he had less than total recall. However, as his body 
became more and more subordinate t6 his soul over the forty days and nights, Moses 
became capable of absorbing all of the Oral Torah without forgetting any part of it. 

Midrash Tehillim explains that Moses knew it was day when God instructed him in 
the Written Law, and he knew it was night when God instructed him in the Oral Law. 

Rabban Gamliel was asked: "How many Torahs were given to Israel?" He answered, 

"Two, one orally and one in writing." 

In Avot de-Rabbi Natan 15, a tale is recounted of a man who came separately to 
Shammai and Hillel and asked how many Torahs there were. Each of them replied, 

"Two, one written and one oral." The man said he was prepared to accept the written 
Torah but not the oral one. Shammai rebuked the man. Hillel sat him down and ex- 
plained that even as he had accepted that the aleph of the alphabet was aleph and that 
the bet was bet , so he had to accept both the written and oral Torahs in good faith. 

In Likutei Moharan, Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav explains that in each generation 
there are new revelations of the Torah. Some of these should be written down, while 
others should only be taught orally. To this day, there are teachers of the Torah who 
limit some of their esoteric teachings to oral explanations that are not supposed to be 
written down. 

Jacob Neusner uses the term "Dual Torah" instead of "the two Torahs," and this 
usage has become widely accepted.

352. THE GIVING OF THE SONG OF SONGS 

Some say that the Song of Songs was given at the Red Sea at the time the waters parted, the 
heavens opened, and all the secrets of heaven were revealed. Then, it is said, a maidservant 
saw at the sea things that were not seen by the prophet Ezekiel. It is also said that the whole 
world existed for the day on which the Song of Songs was given. 

Others say that the Song of Songs was given on Mount Sinai, together with the Torah, 
and that God Himself, not King Solomon, is the true author, and it was God who gave it 
to His people. 

Defending the inclusion of the Song of Songs in the Bible, Rabbi Akiba said, "All 
the books of the Bible are holy, but the Song of Songs is the Holy of Holies." Here the 
Song of Songs is described as being revealed in a revelationatlKe Red Sea that is 
parallel to that at Mount Sinai. In each case heaven opened and its secrets in the form 
of the Torah or, as here, the Song of Songs, were revealed. Note that the parting of the 



278 MYTHS OF THE HOLY WORD 


Red Sea is the second most important revelation in Jewish history, the first being the 
giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. This directly implies that the Song of Songs is the 
holiest book of the Bible after the Torah. 

The alternate version presents the Song of Songs as even holier, in that it is said to 
have been given along with the Torah at Mount Sinai, and disputes the tradition that 
King Solomon was its author by stating that the true author was none other than God 
Himself. Both versions of this myth emphasize the unimaginable holiness of the Song 
of Songs and counter any resistance to it as merely a collection of erotic love poems.

Song of Songs Rabbah 1:11. 


353. THE ORIGIN OF THE SHEMA 

When the hour drew near for Jacob to take leave of this world, he called his sons together 
and said to them, "Do you have any doubts that God spoke and the world came into 
being?" They replied, "Hear, O Israel, our father. Just as you have no doubts that God 
spoke and the world came into being, so too do we have no doubts. Surely, The Lord , our 
God, the Lord is one " (Deut. 6:4). That is why it is still said, to this day, "Hear, O Israel, the 
Lord our God, the Lord is one." And that is how the prayer of the Shema was created. 

This legendary explanation for the origin of the Shema builds on the fact that "Is- 
rael" refers both to Jacob, who became Israel, and to the people Israel. Usually "Hear, 

O Israel" is understood to refer to the people Israel, but since Jacob's name was changed 
to Israel, the opening phrase of the Shema, "Hear, O Israel" can be understood to be 
directed to the patriarch Jacob/Israel as well as to the people Israel. Since his sons add 
"our father," there can be no question that they are directing their words to Jacob. This 
same kind of double reference for "Israel" is found in Genesis 49:2: Assemble your- 
selves, and hear, you sons of Jacob, and hearken to Israel , your father. 

In the version of the origin of the Shema found in Deuteronomy Rabbah, Jacob's con- 
cern is that his sons not be idol worshippers. So he called all his sons to his bed and said, 

"Hear your father, Israel, and worship God, whom your father worships." They an- 
swered, "Hear, O Israel, our father, the Lord our God, the Lord is one." Both versions 
draw on the double meaning of Israel both as Jacob and as the people of Israel. 

. The first verse of the Shema, from J Peuteronomy fr4 . reads: Shema Yisrael, Adonai 
Eloheinu, Adonai Ehad, "Hear,!? IsraeCthe Lord our God, the Lord is One." The Shema 
is the primary proclamation of belief in Judaism, an ^esse ntial part of the daily prayer 
service. According to the Shulhan Arukh, the Code of Jewish Law, the first verse of the 
Shema is recited in a loud voice. It is the practice of Yemenite Jews to read the Shema 
out loud, in unison. This is based on the belief that God harkens to the Shema when it 
is read in unison. This tradition is based on Song of Songs Rabbah 8:13: "When Israel 
reads the Shema with proper kavanah (intention), in one voice, God and all the heav- 
enly hosts hearken to their voice. But when the reading of the Shema is fragmented, 

God tells them to learn from the angels, who praise God in one voice and one melody." 

Also, it is customary to cover one's eyes when reciting the first verse of the Shema 
(Shulhan Arukh, Keriat Shema, 61:5). This custom can be traced to the talmudic sage. 

Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi, who covered his face with his hand when he accepted the Yoke 
of Heaven (B. Ber. 13b).

354. THE HOLY BREATH 


King David wrote the Psalms with divine inspiration — with the Holy Breath. This Hol y 
Breath is still in the words of th e Psalms . When a person recites the Psalms, his breath 
arouses the Holy Breath in these words. Therefore, when a person recites the Psalms, it is 
as if King David himself were chanting them. 

This is a teaching of Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav. The Holy Breath is the Rnah ha- 
Kodesh, which can also be translated as "the Holy Spirit." (See "The Holy Spirit," p. 

18). Ruah means both "breath" and "spirit." Ruah ha-Kodesh is the source of divine 
inspiration, with which King David is said to have written the Psalms.

355. RAVA CREATES A MAN 

Rava said, "If the righteous wished, they could create a world." So he created a man and 
sent him to Rabbi Zera. Rabbi Zera spoke to the man, but he did not answer. When Rabbi 
Zera realized that he must have been created by magic, he said, "Return to your dust." 
And the golem dissolved into dust. 

This is one of the earliest mythic versions of an attempt to create a human being, a 
golem. While lacking in detail, this talmudic tale implies that Rava has somehow used 
magical powers to create a man. Rabbi Zera, on the other hand, does not believe that 
such a creation is permitted, and he commands the golem to return to the dust. 

From this account we learn that the golem was defective in that it could not com- 
municate, which leads Rabbi Zera to conclude that the man is not real. Other versions 
of the golem myth mention that it cannot reproduce. 

In the same section of tractate Sanhedrin there is an account of a three-year old calf 
created by Rav Haninah and Rav Oshaya. They were said to study the Sefer Yetzirah, 
the Book of Creation, every Sabbath eve, and using the knowledge they learned there 
they created the calf and ate it.

356. JEREMIAH CREATES A GOLEM 

The prophet Jeremiah studied the Sefer Yetzirah , the Book of Creation, on his own. Then a 
heavenly voice came forth and commanded, "Find a companion!" So Jeremiah began to 
study that book with his son, Sira. Together they submerged themselves in the Sefer Yetzirah 
for three years. At the end of three years, they set about combining the letters of the 
alphabet, and in this way they created a man on whose head was written YHVH Elohim 
emet — "The Lord God is Truth," and there was a knife in his hand. All at once the being 
they had created erased the first letter of emet — truth, leaving only met — dead. Distraught, 
Jeremiah asked the man why he had done this. The man answered: "God created you in 
His image, but now that you have created a man, people will say, 'These two are the only 
gods in the world/" Jeremiah asked, "What can we do?" The man answered: "Pronounce 
the letters backward with which you created me." So they did, and the being turned to 
ashes and dust. 



280 MYTHS OF THE HOLY WORD 


There are a series of myths about the creation of the golem, a man made out of clay 
and brought to life drawing on the power of the Hebrew alphabet. Here the prophet 
Jeremiah is said to have created such a golem drawing on the mystical secrets found 
in the Sefer Yetzirah, the Book of Creation, one of the earliest (some would say the 
earliest) kabbalistic texts. Here the being that Jeremiah and his son bring to life uncreates 
itself by erasing the first letter of emet— Truth 7 — inscribed on its forehead, leaving 
met — "dead," as the creature itself feels that its creation is wrong, since it attempts to 
duplicate God's power in creating human beings. In most golem myths, the creature 
dies as soon as the aleph that is the first letter of emet is erased. Here, however, the 
golem tells them to pronounce the letters backward to undo the creation. This should 
be seen as an interim stage in the development of the golem myth, which culminates 
in the fully developed myth of the Golem of Prague.

357. THE GOLEM OF IBN GABIROL 

It is said about Rabbi Solomon ibn Gabirol that he drew upon the mysteries to create a 
woman who served him. When he was denounced to the authorities, he showed them 
that she was not a full or complete creature. And he restored her to the pieces of wood of 
which she had been constructed. 

The Hebrew poet Solomon ibn Gabirol (1021-1056) was also said to be versed in 
kabbalistic mysteries. In this account he creates a female golem for the purpose of serv- 
ing him. There is some ambiguity about whether she was created for sexual purposes. 

Had he created her for some greater good, such as the protection of the community, this 
might have been seen as acceptable. But that was not the case. When confronted by the 
authorities, he demonstrated that the woman was not fully human, rather, she is a fe- 
male golem. 

On the one hand the story seems to extol the powers of Ibn Gabirol, but on the 
other hand he is portrayed as self-serving. Also, there is a hint of the salacious about 
his intentions in creating such a golem. But, above all, it is evidence that the golem 
motif, which first appears in the Talmud in the creation of a calf that was eaten on the 
Sabbath, was still alive. This eleventh-century myth about creating a golem is trans- 
formed into the cycle of stories about the Golem of Prague. In the latter, however, the 
creation of the golem is compelled by the dire situation in which the Jews were found, 
suffering from regular pogroms through the Middle Ages. Since there was no solu- 
tion in reality, a fantasy solution evolved, that of the golem created by Rabbi Judah 
Loew to protect the Jews of Prague from the blood libel accusation, in which Jews 
were falsely accused of using the blood of a Christian (usually a child) to make matzah 
for the Passover Seder, a libel that led to centuries of pogroms against the Jews through- 
out Europe. Yet even though the purposes in creating these two golems, one female 
and one male, are quite different, the knowledge and powers attributed to both fig- 
ures underlie both tales. 

How was the golem of Ibn Gabirol created? The story lacks details, but the method 
was surely by some means of holy letters and names. In the Yudel Rosenberg versions 
of the golem cycle, which are probably much later than they were claimed to be — 
nineteenth century instead of the sixteenth— Rabbi Loew went through a magical ritual, 
inscribing the word emet — truth — on the forehead of the golem, and putting a paper 
with God's Name on it in the golem's mouth, walking around it seven times, till it 
glowed. Only then did it come to life. Later, after the golem had served its purpose. 



THE COLEM 281 


Rabbi Loew turned it back into clay. This clay is said still to be found in the attic of the 
Alt-Neu (Old-New) synagogue in Prague, where Rabbi Loew once served. A compari- 
son of the two stories demonstrates that the same creation can be viewed as sacrilege 
or sacred. 

Others who were said to have created golems include Rabbenu Tam (Rabbi Jacob 
Tam, 1100-1171) and Ibn Ezra (1092-1167). Ibn Ezra is reported to have said, "See what 
God has given by means of the holy letters!" Then he said to the golem, "Go back." 
And it became what it had been before. 

A number of modern authors have written about the golem, including Gustav 
Meyrink, H. Levick, David Frishman, Jorge Luis Borges, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Cynthia 
Ozick, Michael Chabon, Frances Sherwood, and Thane Rosenbaum.

358. THE GOLEM OF RABBI ELIJAH 

Rabbi Elijah of Chelm was a Master of the Name. It was he alone, in his generation, who 
knew the secret pronunciation of God's Name. This gave him the power to accomplish 
anything. So too was he well versed in the Sefer Yetzirah, The Book of Creation. Drawing 
on mysteries revealed there, he made a man of clay, inscribed the word emet — truth — on 
its forehead, and when he uttered God's Name, the golem came to life. Thereafter, the 
golem performed wonders whenever there was urgent need for them. 

Then it happened that the golem began to grow larger and larger, and Rabbi Elijah 
was afraid it might destroy the world. So he ordered the golem to bend down and he 
removed the first letter of the word on its forehead, changing emet into met — dead — and 
at that instant the golem turned back into dust. 

There are several versions of this famous story about the golem of Rabbi Elijah of 
Chelm (sixteenth century). In some versions, the golem is said to have scratched the 
rabbi's face while he removed the name from its forehead, or, in other versions, even 
to have crushed him. Likewise, in some Christian versions Rabbi Elijah is said to have 
used the golem to perform hard work for him, suggesting that his motives in creating 
the golem were not altruistic. 

While most accounts of the golem place the word " emet " on his forehead, some 
describe the word "emet" hung on a chain around his neck. 

Here is the version of the golem story found in Journal for Hermits by Jakob Grimm 
(1808), which became widely disseminated: 

After saying certain prayers and observing certain fast days, the Polish Jews make the 
figure of a man carved from clay or mud. When they pronounce the miraculous name of 
God over him, he must come to life. He cannot speak, but he understands fairly well what 
is commanded. They call him golem and use him as a servant to do all sorts of house- 
work. But he must never leave the house. On his forehead is written emet— truth. Every 
day he gains weight and becomes somewhat larger and stronger than all the others in the 
house, regardless of how little he was to begin with. 

For fear of him, they therefore erase the first letter, so that nothing remains but met — 
death, whereupon he collapses and turns to clay again. But one man's golem once grew 
so tall, and he heedlessly let him keep on growing so long that he could no longer reach 
his forehead. In terror he ordered the servant to take off his boots, thinking that when he 
bent down he could reach his forehead. So it happened, and the first letter was success- 
fully erased, but the whole heap of clay fell on the Jew and crushed him. 

It would appear that Jakob Grimm drew upon the account of Rabbi Elijah's golem, 
although there are some interesting variations. Grimm's version suggests that the golem 
was used as a servant, and that the motives of his creator were not altruistic. In the 



282 MYTHS OF THE HOLY WORD 


Grimm version, as soon as the holy name is removed from the golem's forehead, it 
collapses on top of its creator and kills him. No such catastrophe occurs in the account 
of Rabbi Elijah's golem.

359. THE GOLEM OF PRAGUE 

Again and again the Jewish community of Prague was accused of the blood libel. Rabbi 
Judah Loew, known as the Maharal, prayed that he might be told in a dream how to fight 
against the accusation. In his dream, he received a reply from heaven in ten words, tell- 
ing him to create a golem out of clay, who would protect the Jews against those who 
wanted to destroy them. The Maharal was convinced that the secret of how to bring such 
a creature to life could be found in those ten words. And at last he found it. 

The Maharal called his son-in-law and his oldest pupil, and disclosed the secret to them 
about how the golem could be created. They served as his assistants, each of them represent- 
ing one of the elements of fire, water, and air, who together could complete the creation of the 
golem out of earth, the fourth element. He made them vow not to reveal the secret to anyone. 

Then on the twentieth of Adar in the year 5340 (1580), the three of them left Prague at 
four o'clock in the morning and went to the river Moldau. Out of the clay they dug from 
the bank of the river, they made a human form, which lay there like a man on his back. 
Each of them walked around it seven times, reciting a spell that the Maharal had taught 
them, until the golem began to glow, and his body became covered with hair, and nails 
appeared at the tips of his fingers and toes. And when they pronounced the verse And 
God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living creature (Gen. 2:7), the 
golem opened his eyes and looked at them with wonder. The Maharal called out for him 
to stand up, and the golem rose at once to his feet. Then they dressed him in clothes that 
they had brought with them, and put shoes on his feet, so that he looked exactly like a 
man. He saw, heard, and understood everything, but he lacked the power of speech. 

Before dawn all four of them returned home. On the way home, the Maharal told the 
golem that his name was Joseph, and explained why he had been created. So too did he 
tell him that he must obey all of his commands, no matter what, and the golem nodded to 
show that he agreed. 

After that the Maharal told the members of his household that he had met this poor 
man, who was unable to speak, in the street, and he had taken him into the house out of 
pity, to be of service to him. And that is how the golem was created and brought into being. 

Perhaps no Jewish legend has captured the popular imagination as has that of the 
golem, the creature made out of clay by Rabbi Judah Loew of Prague (known as the 
Maharal) and brought to life by the use of Various magical incantations, including holy 
names. This creature, according to the legend, protected the Jews of Prague from vari- 
ous dangers, especially that of the blood libel accusation— that is, the use of the blood 
of Christian children to bake unleavened bread for Passover. This lie had consistently 
disastrous consequences, leading to many pogroms against the Jews. Here the golem 
discovers the body of a murdered Christian child who has been carried into the Jewish 
ghetto, and carries it back through tunnels into the basement of the actual murderer, the 
sorcerer Thaddeus, thus staving off a pogrom. 

Knowledge of this myth cycle is primarily derived from Niflaot Maharal, a collec- 
tion of tales about Rabbi Loew and the golem, published in 1909 by Rabbi Yudel Rosen- 
berg, who claimed that they had been compiled in the sixteenth century by a relative 
of Rabbi Loew. Recent scholars, including Dov Sadan, Gershom Scholem, and Eli Yassif, 
have insisted that Rabbi Rosenberg himself was the author of the book, which he 



THECOLEM 283 


based loosely on the existing oral legends and written versions of the golem myth. 
Such legends certainly existed, such as Jakob Grimm's description of the myth in 1808 
in Journal for Hermits. 

The issue here is whether these are authentic sixteenth-century legends, deriving 
from the period in which Rabbi Judah Loew lived in Prague or immediately after- 
ward, or if they were in fact largely drawn from nineteenth-century folklore, embel- 
lished in the twentieth century by Rabbi Rosenberg. Some of the earliest tales about 
Rabbi Loew are those found in the first volume of the Sippurim series, edited by Wolf 
Pascheles, first published in Prague in 1845. There are a number of precedents for the 
creation of the golem in earlier Jewish literature, including the description of a calf 
that was created magically found in the Talmud: "Haninah and Oshaya spent every 
Sabbath eve in studying the Laws of creation, by means of which they created a calf 
and ate it" ( B . San. 67b). See also "Rava Creates a Man," p. 279.

360. THE END OF THE GOLEM 

After the emperor issued an edict that there must be no more cases of the blood libel 
accusation. Rabbi Loew felt that the golem would not be needed any longer. So he called 
his son-in-law and his oldest pupil, who had taken part in the creation of the golem, and 
at two in the morning they went up to the loft in the Alt-Neu synagogue, where the 
golem was sleeping. 

The three of them placed themselves at the head of the golem, and began to circle 
around him from left to right. There were seven circuits, and after each one they stopped 
and pronounced the spell that the Maharal had taught them, drawn from the Book of 
Creation. It was the same spell they had used to create the golem, only they recited it in 
the opposite order. 

After the seventh circuit the golem was reduced to a mass of clay in the shape of a 
human being. They wrapped it in two old prayer shawls, and hid the mass among the 
fragments of books in the loft, so that nothing of it could be seen. 

The next day it was reported that the golem had rim away. Very few people knew 
what had really taken place. After that the Maharal ordered that no one was to enter the 
loft of the synagogue. People thought it was a precaution against fire, but confidants of 
the Maharal knew that it was because the remains of the golem were lying there. 

Here the golem is uncreated and returned to a mass of clay in the shape of a man by 
reversing the process by which it was created. The remains of the golem are still said 
to be in the loft of the Alt-Neu synagogue in Prague.

361. THE GOLEM IN THE ATTIC 

In the attic of the Alt-Neu synagogue of Prague lie the remains of the golem in the shape 
of a man. These remains have been there since the Maharal returned the golem to a mass 



284 MYTHS OF THE HOLY WORD 


of clay. At that time the Maharal is reported to have said, "You will lie here until the time 
of the Messiah." 

None of the Jews of Prague dared to go up to the attic where the remains of the golem 
are to be found. There was a deep fear of that place. But once some children went up to 
the attic to see if the remains of the golem were still there. After they went up, they were 
unable to come down. After reciting psalms and prayers, the Jews of Prague climbed up 
the big ladder that led to the attic. There they found that the children were lying on the 
floor of the attic, in a deep sleep, nor could they wake them until they carried them out of 
that place. 

After that, no one in the city of Prague dared to go up there. They left the remains 
of the golem alone until the days of the Messiah, when the Maharal said he will come 
back to life. 

This is an oral tale about the golem collected in Israel from a Jew from Czechoslo- 
vakia. It is clear evidence of the continuing power of the golem myth among the Jews 
of Czechoslovakia.

362. THE HOMUNCULUS OF MAIMONIDES 

Among the enemies of Maimonides it is told that he created a monster, a homunculus. 
How did it happen? Maimonides had an assistant, a young man, to whom he taught 
many of the secrets of creation. In time the two became inseparable. Their researches 
were pursued largely in common, and when one of them was at a loss, the other came to 
his assistance. Thus together they studied almost all branches of knowledge. In time the 
student almost surpassed his master in learning, and they decided to follow a path to- 
gether that past generations had never pursued. They wanted to observe the secrets of 
creation and destruction in nature and then solve the great riddle of creation. 

Maimonides showed his assistant a passage in the Book of Creation, where it said, "Kill 
a healthy man, cut his body into pieces, and place the pieces in an airless glass container. 
Sprinkle upon them an essence gathered from the sap of the Tree of Life and the balsam 
of immortality, and after nine months the pieces of this body will be living again. It will 
be unharmable and immortal." 

But who were they to get for this dangerous experiment? They decided it would have 
to be one of them. So they cast lots to decide. But first they swore, in God's Name, that 
whoever lived would permit the dead to ripen, and would not, for whatever reason, 
destroy the apparatus prematurely, in order- to destroy the embryonic life. Both men laid 
their hands on the Torah and swore. The lot was cast and fell to the pupil. Maimonides 
conjured up the Angel of Death, and the young man fell lifeless to the ground. Maimonides 
cut the body into pieces, placed it in a glass container, sprinkled it with the wondrous 
essence, and left the room, which he carefully locked and did not enter for four months. 

Finally, tortured by doubt and curiosity, he looked at the mass of dead flesh. And 
behold, there were no longer severed pieces but structured limbs, as if crystallized in the 
glass container. Happy about the restoration of his student, he left the room and waited a 
month. In the fifth month the form of the human body could already be recognized. In 
the sixth the arteries and nerves were visible, and in the seventh movement and life in 
the organs could be perceived. The researcher, however, became worried. Maimonides 
was now convinced of the veracity of The Book of Creation. And he was terrified about the 
future. 



THE GOLEM 285 


Maimonides was afraid that a horror threatened the human race if he let it come to 
fruition. For such an immortal man might be deified, and people would pray to him, and 
the Laws of Moses would be denied and finally entirely forgotten. At the end of the 
eighth month, uncertain and deeply troubled, he approached the growing being and was 
staggered as the almost completely developed face smiled at him. Unable to bear the 
demonic grin, he ran out of the room ashamed of what he had done. He finally realized 
that man should not investigate too deeply; what is beyond this sphere leads to hell. 

A few days later Maimonides appeared before the Great Council and explained the 
case. After lengthy reflection the learned rabbis agreed: to protect against a horror for 
mankind, and to preserve God's honor, a vow might be broken and such a man killed. 
This decision they based on a verse in Psalms: It is time to act for the Lord , for they have 
violated Your teaching (Ps. 119:126). 

At the beginning of the ninth month, Maimonides stepped into the room, intending to 
destroy his creation. He brought a dog and a cat with him, and he released them and let 
them fly at each other. In the midst of this fighting, the glass container crashed to the 
floor and broke into a thousand pieces. The dead man lay at Maimonides' feet. After he 
recovered himself, Maimonides buried the body and took the pernicious volume and 
threw it into the flames of the fireplace. But nothing was the same again. Maimonides 
was attacked by the learned men of the court, accused of magical practices, and escaped 
judgment only by a timely flight to Egypt. But even there he was pursued and treated as 
an enemy both by his fellow Jews and by unbelievers, and from then on his life was filled 
with sorrow. 

The theme echoed here is that of the creation of the golem by Rabbi Judah Loew, 
and like that tale, this one derives from Prague. But although the golem was created 
out of necessity, in order to protect the Jews of the ghetto from the dangers of the 
blood libel, the homunculus of Maimonides is created purely in order to discover the 
secrets of creation. 

It has been suggested on several occasions that the golem cycle of legends may 
have inspired Mary Shelley's Frankenstein , since both concern the creation of a man, 
the golem by kabbalistic magic and Frankenstein's monster by science. If there was 
indeed a folk source that served to inspire Mary Shelley, it may have been the present 
tale about Maimonides, which was first published at the same time as the earliest 
golem legends, and which has a theme and mood far closer to that of Frankenstein 
than do the tales of the golem. It would be difficult to demonstrate this conclusively, 
since Frankenstein was published in 1818 and Sippurim, the volume in which the present 
tale and earliest golem legend appear, was not published until 1847. However, since 
all indications are that the stories in Sippurim are based on authentic folk sources, 
there is every reason to assume that an oral version of this tale about Maimonides was 
current at the time Mary Shelley wrote her famous novel and probably a century or 
two before that. 

The theme that such daring leads to disaster is common in tales with kabbalistic 
themes such as this. This theme goes all the way back to the famous talmudic story 
about the four sages who entered Paradise ( B . Hag. 14b): Ben Azzai looked and died; 

Ben Zoma looked and lost his mind; Elisha ben Abuyah cut the shoots, that is, became 
an apostate; and only Rabbi Akiba "ascended and descended in peace." This tale has 
always been understood to refer to mystical contemplation and the dangers attending 
it. The moral is clear: if three of four of the greatest sages could not withstand the 
dangers of the mystical ascent, how could the average person? Therefore restrictions 
were made that no more than two at a time could discuss the chariot vision of Ezekiel 
(Ma'aseh Merkavah), and no more than one could study the Mysteries of Creation 
(Ma'aseh Bereshit). In addition, kabbalistic study was forbidden until a man was mar- 
ried and at least 40 (or, some sources say, 30) years old. 



286 MYTHS OF THE HOLY WORD 


This tale indicates that one of the dangers associated with this kind of mystical in- 
dulgence was the creation of a false Messiah, as expressed by the fear of Maimonides 
in this story that once the gestation of the homunculus is complete, he will be immortal. 
This suggests the theme of the hastening of the Messiah by various kabbalistic means, 
including the use of holy names and other methods. Such attempts have always been 
portrayed as forbidden and doomed to failure. The present folktale is of particular in- 
terest because of its apparent antagonism toward Maimonides, one of the most revered 
figures in Judaism. As such, it must be considered to be a folk expression of the contro- 
versy that raged at several periods, including that from which this tale emerged, over 
the writings and teachings of Maimonides. For the background of this dispute, see Mai- 
monidean Criticism and the Maimonidean Controversy , 1180-1240, by Daniel J. Silver. 

Folktales are not the usual mode of expression for such religious conflict. Tracts, 
books, and fiery speeches are more commonly used. But long before the eighteenth 
century, Maimonides had become a figure of folk proportions not unlike the greatest 
sages, such as Rabbi Akiba or the Ari, and was the hero of many folktales. (For an 
example of a more typical tale about Maimonides , see "The Healing Waters" in Miriam's 
Tambourine, pp. 209-216.) Therefore it was not enough to resist his teachings in the 
usual ways, but it was necessary to undermine his folk image as well. That seems to 
be the intention of this tale, which also fits into the pattern of many other cautionary 
anti-Kabbalistic warning tales. 

The lack of knowledge of the true teachings of both Maimonides and the kabbalah 
is evident in the choice of the secret texts from which Maimonides is said to have 
learned his secrets. One of these. The Book of Creation, is the name of an actual kabbalistic 
text, Sefer Yetzirah (in Hebrew literally, "The Book of Formation"), which is one of the 
earliest and most enigmatic kabbalistic works. It does not attempt to impart, however, 
secrets of the kind required to bring the slain assistant to life. Instead it concentrates 
on the mysteries of letters and numbers and is far more abstract and oblique. Nor 
does the quotation from The Book of Creation in the story appear in the actual text of 
Sefer Yetzirah. The combination of anti-Maimonidean and anti-Kabbalistic elements 
suggests that this tale emerged from the Jewish centers of Poland and Lithuania, where 
the old quarrel broke out again in the late Middle Ages. At the same time, the present 
tale is itself a variant of other, positive folktales about the great medical skill and 
supernatural powers of Maimonides. In one of these tales, found in Shalshelet ha- 
Kabbalah, compiled by Gedaliah ibn Yachya (Zolkiew, Russia: 1801), Maimonides is 
forced to swallow poison in a confrontation with the king's physicians, but provides 
the antidote to save himself, while the king's physicians all die from the poison pro- 
vided by Maimonides. In another such tale, an even closer variant to the one at hand, 
the Caliph has Maimonides beheaded, but before his execution, Maimonides instructs 
his students in how to reattach his head, and he fully recovers, much to the consterna- 
tion of the Caliph. It is not a giant step from the powers demonstrated in these tales to 
the creation of the immortal mamin "The Homunculus of Maimonides." Note that the 
parallel theme to the creation of the golem by the Maharal differs in the essential issue 
of the success or failure of the creation. While the golem does fulfill its purpose, the 
creation of Maimonides does not. As such, this tale of Maimonides also adds a note of 
caution to those who found the mystical approach of the Maharal appealing as a way 
to resolve the problems of their time. Clearly, this tale has no historical kernel, nor is it 
characteristic of Maimonides in any way.

MYTHS OF THE DAYS OF AWE 


363. GOD PASSES JUDGMENT 

God said to Israel: "My children, know that I pass judgment four times a year: At the time 
of Passover, I adjudicate cases concerning the produce of the field. At the time of Shavuot, 
cases concerning the fruit of the trees. At the time of Rosh ha-Shanah, cases concerning 
all the inhabitants of the world, who pass before Me in single file. At the time of Sukkot, 
cases concerning the supply of water. 

"During three of these times I judge civil matters, and I make some people rich and 
some people poor, give more to some and less to others. But Rosh ha-Shanah is the time 
for judging capital cases — for deciding life or death." 

Here God establishes four times of the year that He passes judgment. Whereas 
Rosh ha-Shanah is known as the Day of Judgment, this myth expands the time of 
judgment to the three pilgrimage festivals of Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot. But a 
clear distinction is made between civil cases — here linked to the festivals — and capi- 
tal cases — linked only to Rosh ha-Shanah, when God decides who will live and who 
will die. The effect is to have God's judgment present throughout more of the year, as 
an ongoing constant reminder of God's involvement in this world. 

Sources: 

Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 7:2. 


364. THE BOOK OF LIFE AND THE BOOK OF DEATH 

All things are judged on Rosh ha-Shanah, and their fate is sealed on Yom Kippur. Some 
say there is a ledger in heaven that records all that has taken place from the time of Adam 
throughout the generations. The ledger is open, and the hand is writing every single 
thing that a person does below. Whose hand is this? Some say it is that of an angel. Others 
say that the hand belongs to God Himself, and that the book is the book that God is 
writing. That is the meaning of the verse And a scroll of remembrance has been written at His 
behest (Mai. 3:16). This is the Book of Life. 

In addition to the Book of Life, there is a second book, th e Book of Deat h. During the 
Days of Awe God's scrutiny of our fives is intense, and it is to be hoped that if our name has 
strayed to the wrong ledger, God will say, "I have removed your name from the Book of 
Death and put it in the Book of Life, as it is said. For Yahweh has redeemed Jacob " (Isa. 44:23). 

Others say that there are three books opened in heaven on Rosh ha-Shanah, the New 
Year: one for the wholly righteous, one for the wholly wicked, and one for those who are 
neither completely righteous nor completely wicked. The wholly righteous are inscribed 
at once and sealed in the Book of Life; the wholly wicked are inscribed at once and sealed 
in the Book of Death; and the fate of the intermediate is suspended from Rosh ha-Shanah 
until Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. If they repent and are found worthy, they are 
inscribed for life; if they fail to repent, they are inscribed for death. Yet so great is the 
power of atonement on Yom Kippur, that it is said to bring about atonement even for 
those who have not repented. 

When God sits on the Throne of Judgment, the Books of Life and Death are open 
before Him, as it is said, The court sat and the books were opened (Dan. 7 :10). His garment is 
as white as snow, the harTorTHis head pure wool, and His cloak seventy times brighter 
than the sun. A pair of angels, both named Sh ofariel,j*re the keepers of the Bo oks, which 
are closed to everyone else. No other angels have access to the secrets inscribed there. 
Not even Metatron, the Prince of the Presence, is permitted to peer at that divine list. 
Among the sages, only the Ari knew how to peer into those secret books. In this way he 
learned the fate of his followers from the first of Rosh ha-Shanah. 


289 



290 MYTHS OF THE HOLY TIME 


Some say that the world is not only judged on those holy days, but that God sits upon 
the Throne of Judgment and judges the world every day. The Books of the Living and the 
Books of the Dead are opened before him, and all the children of heaven stand before him 
in fear, dread, awe, and trembling. And in this world as well every being trembles before 
the eyes of God. 

Others say that God is a merciful God. Even as clouds are swept away by wind, so the 
iniquities of Israel are swept away in this world, as it is said, I wipe away your sins like a 
cloud (Isa. 44:22). For from the time He created Adam, God has known that if He held 
mankind to account for its successive misdeeds, the world would not endure. Therefore 
God remembers those who observe the Torah, but puts those who commit misdeeds out 
of mind. This means that God removes their names from the Book of Death and puts 
them in the Book of Life. 

There is a series of myths about heavenly books. Some of these are described as 
ledgers in which God keeps track of good and bad behavior. The best known of these 
myths concern the Books of Life and Death. The talmudic version lists three books all 
linked to Rosh ha-Shanah: the Book of Life, the Book of Death, and a book concerning 
the fate of the intermediate. However, for most Jews there is a conscious focusing on the 
Book of Life, while the Book of Death remains for the most part unnamed and largely 
unmentioned, and the notion of a third book has essentially vanished from the tradi- 
tion. The current understanding is that a person's name is inscribed on Rosh ha-Shanah 
either in the Book of Life or the "Other Book," (i.e.. The Book of Death), but the name is 
not sealed until Yom Kippur. This is stated succinctly in the Talmud: "Man is judged on 
Rosh ha-Shanah and his fate is sealed on Yom Kippur" (B. RH 16a). Altogether, these ten 
days are known as the ten Days of Awe, and they serve as an intensive period of self- 
examination and repentance, climaxing on the day of Yom Kippur. There is also an 
element of negotiating with God, as Abraham did concerning the fate of Sodom. The 
hope, of course, is to obtain God's forgiveness in order to change a negative fate. Ac- 
cording to the Talmud ( B . RH 17b), "Great is the power of repentance; it can rescind a 
person's final sentence." 

There is a biblical precedent for these heavenly books, found m jpr pjni^h 17-1- Tf ip 
guilt of Judah is inscribed with a stylus of iron, engraved with an adamant point. Another 
reference is found in Malachi 3:16, And a scroll of remembrance has been written at His 
behest. In Esther Rabbah 2:23, this is referred to as the Book of God. 

It is important to note that these heavenly books are not to be confused with the 
Torah. The general view is that they are for God's eyes alone. These other books were 
never handed down from heaven, as was the Torah. The one possible exception is The 
Book ofRaziel , said to have been given to Adam by the angel Raziel. However, The Book 
ofRaziel can be seen as a substitute for the Torah, until it was given at Mount Sinai. See 
"The Book of Raziel," p. 253. 

Another heavenly book is described by Ezekiel, who has a vision of the semblance of 
the Presence of the Lord (Ezek. 1:28), and hears a mysterious figure speaking, who tells 
him to " open your mouth and eat what I am giving you " (Ezek. 2:8): As I looked , there was a 
hand stretched out to me, holding a written scroll. He unrolled it before me, and it was in- 
so bbed on both the front and the ba ck (Ezek. 2:9-10). Since scrolls are traditionally written 
on only one side, Ezekiel seems to be describing a new kind of book, one relevant to 
the inner, spiritual life, as well as to day to day existence in the world. 

Zechariah has a vision of a flying scroll, presumably of heavenly origin: "What do you 
see? " he asked. And I replied, "A flying scroll, twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide" (Zech. 5:1). 

The description of God seated on His Throne of Judgment derives from Daniel 7:9. 

1 Enoch 47:3 has a vivid description of God seated on the Throne of Glory, with the 
Books of Life and Death open before him, and all of God's counselors standing there. 

3 Enoch describes a pair of angels, whose full names are Shofariel YHVH Memit 
and Shofariel YHVH Mehayeh. They are the keepers of the Books, which are closed to 



MYTHS OF THE DAYS OF AWE 291 


everyone else, even Metatron, who has access to virtually everything else in heaven. 
(Note how the names of these angels contain the Name of God, hinting that they are 
an extension of God.) More common, however, is the tradition that Metatron is the 
heavenly scribe, and he sits on a throne in heaven and writes down the deeds of Is- 
rael. Elisha ben Abuyah ( Aher ) is said to have experienced great shock when he saw 
Metatron thus seated, which led to his exclamation, "There are — God forbid — two 
powers in heaven!" (B. Hag. 15a). 

In Babylonian literature, the gods were said to possess "tablets of destiny" contain- 
ing the fate of all mortals. These tablets were adjusted on the New Year, when Marduk, 
the chief among the Babylonian gods, was said to cast lots in heaven to determine the 
fate of humans. Thus it would appear that the Jewish myth of the Books of Life and 
Death finds its source in this Babylonian tradition. See G. Widengren, The Ascension of 
the Apostle and the Heavenly Book , p. 7ff. 

All in all, the portrait of God found in 3 Enoch is very anthropomorphic, on one 
hand that of an old man, with white hair, described as wool, and at the same time the 
hint of a ruler dressed in armor, prepared to do battle. 3 Enoch 3:1-10 also describes 
four angelic princes known as Trin and Kaddishin who stand around God like court 
officers. These angels argue every case that comes before God. 

While sitting on His Throne of Judgment, God tends to deliver harsh judgments, as 
at the time of the Flood or with Sodom and Gomorrah. That is why everyone in heaven 
is trembling as well. God's judgments of angels who show the slightest hesitation to 
obey his command is swift — they are cast into a flaming river and cease to exist. Like- 
wise, seven planets that did not manifest themselves when commanded to do so are 
punished in the fires of Gehenna. 

From the first of Rosh ha-Shanah the Ari is said to have known the destiny of his 
followers, though he usually kept it secret. See "A Vision at the Wailing Wall," p. 63. 

Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish raises the question of whether there is actually such a 
heavenly book, saying, "Does God really have a book, and in the book he writes? That 
is to say that everything is known and revealed to Him, as it is said. For His eyes are 
upon a mans way; He observes his every step (Job 34:21)." 

This image of a time of judgment has proved to be haunting for all Jewish genera- 
tions. Even secular Jews find their way into the synagogue on Rosh ha-Shanah and 
Yom Kippur, when God's intense scrutiny can be felt by all.

365. THE ORIGIN OF ROSH HA-SHANAH 

Adam repented of his sin by standing in the River Gihon for one hundred and thirty years, 
until his skin began to shrivel. When God saw that Adam had truly repented. He absolved 
him, giving him the Torah as a substitute for the Garden of Eden that he had lost. 

That eventful day was in the first month of Tishrei. Therefore God spoke to Adam: 
"You shall be the prototype of my children. As you have been judged by Me on this day 
and absolved, so your children, Israel, shall be judged by me on this New Year's day, and 
they shall be absolved." 

The usual explanation is that Rosh ha-Shanah is the birthday of the world. Here 
God's absolution of Adam is linked to the origin of Rosh ha-Shanah. Not only does 
this myth provide such an origin, making Rosh ha-Shanah commemorate the day that 
God forgave Adam for the sin of eating the forbidden fruit, but it also states that God 
gave the Torah to Adam as a replacement for having lost the Garden of Eden.

366. THE STRING OF GOD 

When a person is created, he is tied to God with a string. If he sins, the string breaks. But 
if he repents during the Days of Awe, the angel Gabriel comes down and makes a knot in 
the string and ties it and the person is once again tied to God. Because every Jew sins 
once in a while, his string becomes full of knots. But a string with many knots is shorter 
than one without knots. Therefore repentance brings a person closer to God. 

This is a folk allegory in which a person's link to heaven is presented as a string, 
which sin causes to snap. Here the act of making knots, of repairing, is an act of repen- 
tance. Ironically, the more knots, the shorter the string, and the shorter the string, the 
closer to God.

367. THE MONTH OF TISHREI 

The world's birthday is celebrated on Rosh ha-Shanah, the New Year, in the month of 
Tishrei, for that is when God created the world and began to reign over it. So too were the 
patriarchs bom in Tishrei, and in Tishrei they died. In Tishrei Sarah, Rachel, and Hannah 
were conceived. In Tishrei the Israelites were finally set free from Egyptian bondage, and 
in Tishrei they will be redeemed in the time to come. 

This aggadic text argues that the world's birthday is celebrated in the month of 
Tishrei, and links that birthday with the creation of the world. Therefore Rosh ha- 
Shanah is not only the New Year, but also the birthday of the world. Other important 
events that are said to have taken place in the month of Tishrei are also listed to dem- 
onstrate the seminal importance of this month.

368. RE-CREATING THE WORLD 

Every year, on Rosh ha-Shanah, everything returns to its very beginning. Creation is 
renewed. All that was created in the beginning comes into being again. Thus each Rosh 
ha-Shanah the world is re-created. 

This myth describes the world being re-created every Rosh ha-Shanah. Here Rosh 
ha-Shanah is viewed as a ceremony of reaffirmation. Implicit in this interpretation is 
the suggestion that God, who renews the world, might decide not to renew it. 

In Likutei Moharan, Rabbi Nachman describes God as a God of renewal: "Faith is 
needed faith that there is a Creator and a Renewer who can create things anew ac- 
cording to His knowledge and judgment."

Sefer Netivot ha-Shalom, quoting a teaching attributed to the Ari; Likutei Moharan 1:2. 



MYTHS OF THE DAYS OF AWE 293 


369. RENEWING EXISTENCE 

It is said that the original creation of the world was only to last six days, but because of 
the holiness of the Sabbath, the world was renewed for the next six days, and the Sabbath 
has caused it to be renewed ever since. 

Likewise, every Rosh ha-Shanah the existence of the world is renewed. That is because 
on Rosh ha-Shanah, the birthday of the world, God judges all His creations. It is decided in 
heaven whether everything in creation is fulfilling the secret purpose of creation, which is 
known to God alone. For if God determined that creation was acting against God's intent, 
there would be no future need of it, and all of existence would come to an end. 

This important myth emphasizes the world's fragility, and that its continuity is not 
guaranteed, but that it is renewed every Sabbath and every Rosh ha-Shanah. This 
changes the meaning of Rosh ha-Shanah, which serves as the day of Judgment not 
only for people, but for the world as well. Those living in the current nuclear age can 
identify with the acute awareness of the fragility of existence that inspired this myth.

370. THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 

On Rosh ha-Shanah, God sits on the seat of judgment, and the books of the living and the 
dead are open before him. Then all those who have come into the world pass before God 
like a flock. This not only includes all of humanity, but every living creature is judged on 
this day — the Children of the Covenant as well as those not part of the Covenant; those 
who have free choice as well as those who do not have free choice. No one is left out of 
this judgment; even the angels are judged on that day, for it is the Day of Judgment. 

God made this Day of Judgment to ensure that all abide by the Law. So too did God 
create the prosecuting angel who comes before Him and demands that all people in the 
world be judged. So it is that on Rosh ha-Shanah the judgment is written and on Yom 
Kippur it is signed and sealed. 

Rosh ha-Shanah is both the Day of Judgment and the New Year. As the Day of 
Judgment, it is a solemn occasion on which God makes a judgment about whether we 
will live or die in the coming year and writes it down. However, it is not signed and 
sealed until Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. Yet Rosh ha-Shanah is also the New 
Year, and as such it is a day of celebration. Both of these contradictory qualities — the 
solemn and the celebratory — characterize Rosh ha-Shanah, which is also a day of re- 
membrance, a day of sounding the shofar, and a holy convocation.

371. THE HIGH PRIEST ENTERS THE HOLY OF HOLIES 

On Yom Kippur the High Priest is surrounded by his brethren, the priests, as well as the 
Levites and the rest of the people. Before he enters the Holy of Holies, they all pronounce 
benedictions before him and pray for his welfare. Then a golden cord is attached to his 
foot, so that if he should die in the Holy of Holies they can drag him out without entering 
it themselves. 



294 MYTHS OF THE HOLY TIME 


He takes three steps, then another three, then another three, and they all remain where 
they are and do not follow him. He enters the Holy of Holies and hears the sound of the 
wings of the cherubim, who sing and beat their wings. Then he bums incense, and the 
sound of their wings subsides, and there is perfect silence. At that moment a ray of light 
goes forth, along with the scent of pure balsam, and it pervades the Holy of Holies. Then 
everything is still, and there is no room for the Accuser. 

Then the priest opens his mouth in prayer, and prays with devotion and joy. And when 
he is finished, the cherubim lift up their wings and begin to sing again. Then the High 
Priest knows that his prayer has been accepted, and that there is joy above and below. 

The Holy of Holies of the Temple in Jerusalem was only permitted to be entered 
one day a year, on Yom Kippur, and then only by the High Priest. This passage from 
the Zohar describes the great care that was taken to enter there, and the fear and trem- 
bling that accompanied this mission, where any error might be fatal. Further, great 
importance lay in how well this mission went, for if the prayer of the High Priest is 
accepted, it is a sign that God has decided to show mercy to the people of Israel. 

Note the fascinating detail of the golden cord that is tied to the foot of the High 
Priest, in case it should become necessary to pull him out. This, in itself, shows how 
much was at stake in entering the Holy of Holies.

372. THE DAYS OF AWE 

During the ten Days of Awe between Rosh ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur, God is close to 
everyone, to every individual, and God hears with compassion the voices that rise in 
prayer and supplication. 

Rosh ha-Shanah is the first of the ten Days of Awe, and the shofarjs blown to an- 
nounce that the time for repentance has begun. This is the time to returnfrom all the evil 
places where one has gone astray. Let all who desire to return, turn back to the true place 
of the world, where all is restored to perfection; those who do not will receive the retribu- 
tion they deserve. 

Yom Kippur, the last of the Days of Awe, is called the Sabbath of Sabbaths, as it is said. 
It shall be a Sabbath of complete rest for you (Lev. 23:32). For while the ten Days of Awe are a 
process of turning toward heaven, on Yom Kippur God comes down from heaven, close 
to Israel. 

The Days of Awe are the ten days in the month of Tishrei from Rosh ha-Shanah to 
Yom Kippur. This is a period of intense repentance, as God is said to decide a person's 
fate for the coming year on Rosh ha-Shanah and to seal that fate on Yom Kippur.

373. LIGHT IS SOWN FOR THE RIGHTEOUS 

Before Kol Nidrei a great light comes down from on high, filling all the worlds and the 
angels and souls to overflowing, as it is said. Light is sown for the righteous (Ps. 97:11). This 
light collects because of the tears shed before God's Name. 



MYTHS OF THE DAYS OF AWE 295 


Here the phrase from Psalms, Light is sown for the righteous (Ps. 97:11), is taken liter- 
ally, and a great light is described as descending from heaven on Kol Nidrei, the open- 
ing prayer that ushers in Yom Kippur. This light, it is understood, is the divine presence 
filling the world. Indeed, Yom Kippur is often described as a time when God's scrutiny 
is greater than ever, but here it is presented in positive terms, as a gift from God for tears 
of repentance shed over a year of sins.

374. GATHERING SOULS 

Rabbi Hayim ben Attar, known as the Or ha-Hayim, would often leave his house after 
Shabbat was over and spend the whole week in the mountains of Jerusalem. He would 
take seven challahs with him and a pitcher of milk, and he would return home only on 
the eve of Shabbat. Then he would start chanting the Song of Songs with great fervor. 

While he was reciting the Song of Songs, there was a sound of flying wings all around. 
Everyone who was present there heard it. And when he was asked about it, the Or ha-Hayim 
said, "Those are the souls I repaired during the week, while I was in the mountains." 

It was said that even when his wife threw out the crumbs of the challahs, the sound of 
wings could be heard, for those souls came to share the crumbs of the Tzaddik. 

Then, at the time of the Days of Awe, the Or ha-Hayim would leave Jerusalem. He 
would spend the eve of Rosh ha-Shanah alone in a hut on the shore of Lake Kinneret in 
the Galilee, and from time to time he could be seen entering the waters. 

When someone once asked him why he did this, he replied, "I am assisting the souls 
that are here to immerse themselves in the Kinneret, to sanctify themselves before the 
onset of Rosh ha-Shanah." Those close to the rabbi understood that the Or ha-Hayim was 
engaged in restoring lost souls at the time of the Days of Awe. 


As the myth of the Ari teaches, the most important actions that Jews can take are 
those of tikkun olam, repairing the world. For rabbis such as the Or ha-Hayim (Rabbi 
Hayim ben Attar, known by the title of his biblical commentary, which means "the 
light of life") and Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, one of the most important duties of 
repair concerned raising up the souls of the dead who have somehow become trapped 
in this world. This theme is also found in "The Field of Souls," p. 168. In "Gathering 
Souls," the Or ha-Hayim does this holy work during the week by going off into the 
mountains alone, and he returns only for the Sabbath, when he is followed by flocks 
of the souls he has set free. The Or ha-Hayim was the most famous Jewish sage of his 
time living in the Holy Land. The Hasidim believed that the Ba'al Shem Tov had been 
barred by heaven from going to the Holy Land because the combination of his merits 
and those of the Or ha-Hayim, along with those of the Holy Land, would force the 
coming of the Messiah. This suggests that the Or ha-Hayim was regarded by the 
Hasidim as the equal of the Ba'al Shem Tov.

375. A SCAPEGOAT FOR AZAZEL 

And from the Israelite community Aaron shall take two he-goats for a sin offering and a 
ram for a burnt offering. Aaron is to offer his own bull of sin offering, to make expiation 
for himself and for his household. Aaron shall take the two he-goats and let them stand 
before the Lord at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting; and he shall place lots upon the 



296 MYTHS OF THE HOLY TIME 

two goats, one marked for the Lord and the other marked for Azazel. Aaron shall bring 
forward the goat designated by lot for the Lord, which he is to offer as a sin offering; 

. while the goat designated by lot for Azazel shall be left standing alive before the Lord, to 
make expiation with it and to send it off to the wilderness for Azazel. 

The custom of sending a scapegoat out into the desert as an offering to Azazel is 
clearly a remnant of a pagan ritual. 

In Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 51, God identifies the scapegoat as an atonement for Himself: 

"This he-goat shall be an atonement for Me, because I have diminished the size of the 
moon." See "The Quarrel of the Sun and the Moon," p. 112, which concludes with God 
diminishing the moon. We should not overlook the strangeness of God feeling the need to 
atone. This is reminiscent of Jung's portrayal of God in Answer to Job. It is one more ex- 
ample of the kind of personification of God so commonly found in rabbinic sources, where 
God also studies Torah, suffers, mourns, puts on tallit and tefillin and prays. 

Who was Azazel, to whom the scapegoat was sent? This appears to be a remnant 
of a pagan myth in which Azazel was some kind of desert god. Thus the scapegoat 
represents a sacrifice to the forces of evil. In modern Israel, the phrase "Lekh le Az az el" 
means "Go to hell!" 

A description of the sacrifice of the scapegoat is found in B. Yoma 67a: "On Yom 
Kippur (the Day of Atonement) a goat was thrown off a high cliff in the desert, to 
atone for the sins of the Jews. A red ribbon was hung up in the Temple on that day. 

When the goat was thrown off the cliff, the ribbon turned white." This description 
links the Temple and the sacrifice of the scapegoat, viewing it as a kind of remote 
Temple offering. The transformation of the ribbon from red to white confirms this. 

Another scapegoat sacrifice is described in the Talmud (B. Hullin 60a). A goat was 
offered in the Temple on every Rosh Hodesh, the first of the month, as a sin offering 
brought to atone for God's shrinking the moon, a decision that God later came to 
regret. (See Numbers 28:15). Therefore, on every Rosh Hodesh, when the moon is small, 
a sin offering was brought to atone for that decision.

376. SOUNDING THE SHOFAR 


Why is the shofar sounded on Rosh ha-Shanah? Because God said: "Sound a ram's horn 
before Me so that I remember on your behalf the binding of Isaac, the son of Abraham, 
and account it to you as if you had bound yourselves on the altar before Me." 

What is the purpose of the long and short blasts of the shofar? Some say the purpose is 
to confuse Satan, the Accuser. What would happen if the shofar were not sounded at the 
beginning of the year? Evil would befall by the end of it, because the Accuser has not 
been confused. 


Others say that God made up a secret language, that of the ram's horn, which is only 
understood by Him, so that the Accuser should not know the pleas of His children. And 
all those who know the mystery of that secret language walk in the light of the counte- 
nance of God. For that is the very light cast on the first day, when God said, "Let there be 
light" (Gen. 1:3). 


, The sounding of the shofar causes God to rise up from the Throne of Justice and move 
over to sit in the Throne of Mercy. 



MYTHS OF THE DAYS OF AWE 297 


God Himself will sound the shofar at the End of Days, when He leads the exiles of 
Israel into the Promised Land, and when the Messiah reveals himself, as it is said. My 
Lor dGod shall sound the ram's horn (Zerh. 9: 14) That is why, when we hear the sound of 
the shofar, we beseech God to rebuild the Temple. 

This myth clearly demonstrates the linkage between myth and ritual. Here the 
ritual of sounding the shofar on Rosh ha-Shanah invokes the myth of the Akedah, the 
binding of Isaac. The continuity is the shofar, the ram's hom, taken from the ram 
sacrificed in place of Isaac. For the midrash recounts how Moses blew the first shofar 
at Mount Sinai, while it is said that Elijah will blow the second of the ram's two horns 
at the time of the coming of the Messiah. And the act of performing the ritual of sound- 
ing the shofar serves to remind God of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son, and 
thus for God to account it to those performing the ritual as if they themselves had 
been bound before God. 

The belief, found in Pesikta de-Rav Kahana, that the sounding of the shofar causes God 
to move from His Throne of Justice to the Throne of Mercy is an example of theurgy. 

The Zohar identifies Yom Kippur as the day Isaac was bound on the altar. That is 
why it is fitting to read the portion about the binding of Isaac during the Afternoon 
Prayer, in order to recall the merits of Isaac. Genesis Rabbah 56 quotes Abraham as 
saying to God: "May it be Your will that when the children of Israel commit transgres- 
sions, that the binding of Isaac may then be remembered for their benefit, and may 
You be filled with compassion for them." 

Here, once again, we find the theme of confusing or silencing Satan, the Accuser, so 
that he cannot testify against Israel. God, who sides with His children, Israel, against 
the Accuser during the Days of Awe, has created a secret language, that of the shofar. 

The long and short blasts communicate Israel's desire for God's compassion, but con- 
fuse the Accuser, who does not understand the secret language. See "The Master Key" 
in Gabriel's Palace , pp. 198-199. 

The notion that God made up a secret language, that of the ram's hom, is quite 
fascinating. The ram's horn is blown on Rosh ha-Shanah (when all Jews are required 
to be present to hear it sounded), and at other times in strict patterns of short and long 
blasts. Identifying these as a secret language is an acknowledgment that the meaning 
of these blasts is unknown, except to God. 

For more of the myths surrounding the ram's hom, see "The Ram Sacrificed at 
Mount Moriah," p. 150.

377. THE CLOSING OF THE GATES 

On Yom Kippur, at the end of the afternoon prayers, when the sun is over the tree tops, it 
is time for the Closing Prayer. This prayer is known as the "Closing of theGates." What 
gates are these? Thb ^ gates of the heavenly Temple . For when the earthly Temple was 
destroyed, God'sTiome was removed from this world. That is why all of Israel direct 
their hearts to heaven on Yom Kippur, praying for their prayers to ascend on high and be 
accepted with compassion before the heavenly gates are closed. 

At the end of the service, the reader says, "The Lord, He is God" seven times, and the 
congregation repeats the phrase after him. The seven times correspond to the departure of 
the Shekhinah who rested in their midst from evening to evening. Now they accompany the 
Shekhinah through the seven firmaments that praise the Creator, who dwells above them, 
as it is said, God ascends midst acclamation; the Lord, to the blasts of the hom (Ps. 47:6). 



298 MYTHS OF THE HOLY TIME 


This teaching, attributed to Rav, demonstrates the far-reaching consequences of 
the destruction of the Temple. Originally, the Closing Prayer on Yom Kippur corre- 
sponded to the closing of the gates of the Temple. This myth from the Jerusalem Tal- 
mud suggests that when the Temple existed, the people directed their hearts to the 
Temple, believing it to be the home of God in this world. But now that the Temple is in 
ruins, it is necessary to redirect one's heart to God in heaven, for the closing of the 
gates now refers to the gates of the heavenly Temple, which still exists, where prayers 
are offered daily to God by the angels. For more on the traditions of the heavenly 
Temple, see "The Celestial Temple," p. 416.

378. THE FINAL BLAST 

After the Kaddish is recited at the close of Yom Kippur, one blast is blown on the shofar. 
Some say this is in remembrance of Moses, who ordered the shofar to be blown when he 
descended from Mount Sinai after he received the second set of the tablets on the tenth of 
Tishrei. Therefore later generations established the custom of blowing the shofar at the 
close of Yom Kippur, to remember how Israel received the Torah with a whole heart and 
willing soul. 

Here the shofar is blown at the close of Yom Kippur to recall the blowing of the 
shofar at Mount Sinai, when Moses descended with the Torah.

379. THE WATER LIBATION 

When the Temple in Jerusalem was still standing, a water libation took place during 
Sukkot, the Feast of Tabernacles. The water dripped down into a cavern that was under 
the altar. This cavern existed from the six days of Creation, and it went down into the 
very depths. When the angel in charge of water heard the water dripping down, he com- 
manded the water reservoirs in heaven to give forth water, as well as those under the 
earth. In this way the water libation brought about abundant rain. 

This myth describes a Temple ritual intended to bring rain. Just as smoke rises 
from a sacrifice, and then the fire of the Lord descends to consume the burnt offering 
(see 2 Chron. 7:3), so here water is dripped upon the Temple altar, and, in turn, this 
brings about the release of water reservoirs in heaven and under the earth, resulting 
in rain. Thus the rain descends exactly as does the divine fire that consumes the offer- 
ing. The myth also brings in the angel in charge of water, who releases the waters 
above and below.

p. 323.

MYTHS OF SUKKOT 299 


380. THE SEVEN SHEPHERDS 

It is known that on the first night of Sukkot a mysterious guest sometimes appears in the 
booths of the righteous. This is none other than Abraham, who is the first of seven guests 
to appear, one on each night of the festival. On the second night Isaac appears, and on the 
third, Jacob. Joseph appears on the fourth night, Moses on the fifth, Aaron on the sixth, 
and King David on the last night of Sukkot. Blessed, indeed, are those who receive these 
guests, who are known as the Seven Shepherds. Every day of Sukkot one of these seven 
shepherds arrives at the sukkah as a guest. 

Before these celestial guests can appear, they must be invited with the following words: 
"Let us invite our guests. Let us prepare the table. You shall live in booths seven days (Lev. 
23:42). Be seated, guests from on high, be seated! Be seated, guests of faith, be seated!" 

Some say there is another visitor who is present for all seven days of the festival. That 
is the Shekhinah, who dwells in the sukkah of each righteous man as She once dwelled in 
the Temple in Jerusalem. She spreads Her wings over him from above, and Abraham and 
the other holy guests make their dwelling with him inside it. And one should rejoice on 
each of the seven days, and cheerfully welcome these guests to stay. 

All the other days of the year, the Seven Shepherds are not able to descend to the lower 
world. This happens only in a sukkah , when air from the upper worlds is drawn down, 
and the sukkah becomes the Holy of Holies, and the Shekhinah dwells in it. Only then can 
the Seven Shepherds descend and enter this world. Therefore, everyone who fulfills the 
mitzvah of the sukkah becomes a partner with God in the work of Creation. Through the 
making of the sukkah and making a place for the Shekhinah to rest, one fulfills God's inten- 
tion to make a dwelling place below. 

Blessed is the portion of those who have merited all this. For it is said that those who 
welcome the celestial guests into their sukkah will rejoice with them both in this world 
and the next. 

The festival of Sukkot derives from a biblical injunction: You shall live in booths seven 
days (Lev. 23:42). Jews observe this holiday by building sukkot — booths — which have 
leaves and branches for a roof. During Sukkot Jews eat all their meals in these booths. 

There is a widely known tradition that the Ushpizin, literally, "guests," who consist of 
seven patriarchal figures, come to visit the booths (sukkot) of righteous Jews during 
the festival of Sukkot, one on each night of the festival. These guests are known as the 
Seven Shepherds. When Jews leave their homes and enter the sukkah they receive the 
Shekhinah as a guest, along with one of the Seven Shepherds. Every night of Sukkot 
the prayer is recited that invites the guest to enter. They are invited with the words, 

"Be seated, be seated you exalted guests." The patriarch Abraham is invited on the 
first day, and on subsequent nights Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joseph, and David are invited 
with the words "May it please you, my exalted guest, that all the other exalted guests 
dwell here with me and with you." 

There are varying lists of the Seven Shepherds. According to Micah 5:4 and B. Sukkah 
52b, they are Adam, Seth, Methuselah, David, Abraham, Jacob, and Moses. According 
to the Zohar (3:103b-104a), they are Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, together with Moses, 
Aaron, and Joseph, plus King David. 

Among some modern Jews there is a new custom of also inviting the four matri-

300 MYTHS OF THE HOLY TIME 


381. DWELLING IN EXILE 

On Rosh ha-Shanah, the Day of Judgment, God sits in judgment of all the inhabitants of the 
world, and on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, He seals that judgment. Now it is pos- 
sible that the judgment decreed for Israel will be banishment. That is why a sukkah is built 
right after Yom Kippur, for when the people of Israel build the sukkot, and then banish 
themselves from their homes to dwell in them, God considers this banishment equivalent 
to their dwelling in exile in Babylon, and therefore God continues to shelter Israel. 

So on the Festival of Sukkot, all of Israel goes to fetch myrtles and willows and palm 
branches and build sukkot and sing praises to God because He has atoned for them on the 
Day of Atonement. And on the first day of the feast God says, "Let bygones be bygones. 
From this moment on commences a new reckoning. Today, the first day of Sukkot, is to be 
the first day of this new era of reckoning." 

Sukkot is one of the three Jewish pilgrimage festivals, along with Passover and 
Shavuot. In ancient times, before the Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, Jews in the 
Land of Israel tried to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem on these days to bring harvest 
offerings to the Temple. Of these three festivals, Sukkot most retains the character of a 
harvest festival. The lulav, a palm branch, and the etrog, a citron fruit, are carried dur- 
ing Sukkot services. During the seven days of Sukkot, some Jews eat and sleep in 
booths known as sukkot that are erected beside their homes or synagogues, or on roof- 
tops of apartment buildings, with only leafy boughs serving for the roof. This is to 
remind them of the wandering of the Israelites in the wilderness during the time of 
the Exodus, when the people had to live in temporary dwellings. 

This myth gives an additional and crucial symbolic meaning to the custom of build- 
ing sukkot during the festival of Sukkot, and living in them for the duration of the 
holiday. The sukkot recall the 40 years of wandering of the Israelites, and the condi- 
tions of exile that they endured. Here also the sukkot are linked to the Babylonian 
exile. The new meaning that is added here states that God regards living in the sukkot 
to be the equivalent of living in exile. One effect of this myth is to give additional 
meaning to the ritual of building and living in sukkot. In this way, myth and ritual 
reaffirm each other. 

Note the role reversal in this myth, which has God atoning for the people, instead 
of the people atoning to God. This myth is also intended to highlight the quality of 
God's mercy, in which God both atones for and forgives the people for all their sins.

382. THE FEAST OF SUKKOT IN THE WORLD TO COME 

In the World to Come, when Israel is created anew, Israel will still take the lulav cluster 
and praise God with it. So great is the merit of the lulav cluster that in reward for its 
observance, God will inflict punishment on Israel's enemies, rebuild the Temple, and 
bring the Messiah. 

God will build a sukkah for the righteous in the world to come. So too will the people 
dwell in that heavenly sukkah , and the Seven Shepherds visit each and every sukkah , each 
of the seven days of Sukkot. 

This myth indicates that festival rituals performed in this world will still be per- 
formed in the World to Come. The Sukkot ritual is the example given of a ritual that 
will be performed on high. 



MYTHS OF SIMHAT TORAH 301 


The effect of this myth is to raise the importance of the ritual of the lulav, to empha- 
size the importance of its being observed. This myth also strongly suggests that Sukkot 
is to be regarded not as a minor holiday, but as a major one, so important it is still 
observed in the World to Come. 

The lulav cluster that is used in the Sukkot ceremony is said to symbolize many 
things. It not only represents God's glory, but also the patriarchs, the matriarchs, and 
the Sanhedrin, the high court among Jews in Second Temple Palestine.

383. THE BODY OF MOSES 

Rabbi Hayim Vital once dreamed that it was the ancient custom of Israel to bring the 
body of Moses to the synagogue on Simhat Torah. The reason for this custom is that 
Simhat Torah is the day of rejoicing with the Torah that had been given through Moses. 
Furthermore, on this day the Torah portion that is read from Deuteronomy recounts the 
death of Moses. 

Now the day of the festival had arrived, and they brought the body of Moses to the 
synagogue in Safed. It took many men to carry the body inside the synagogue, for it was 
at least ten cubits long. Then the body, wrapped in a white robe, was placed on a very 
long table that had been prepared in advance. But as soon as the body of Moses was 
stretched out on the long table, it became transformed into a scroll of the Torah that was 
opened to its full length, like a long letter, from the first words of Genesis to the end of 
Deuteronomy. And in the dream they began to read the words of the Torah, starting with 
the creation, and they continued until they reached the last words, displayed before all 
Israel (Deut. 34:12). 

All this time the rabbi of Safed sat at the head of the table, and Hayim Vital sat at the 
foot. And in the dream it occurred to Hayim Vital that while the rabbi of Safed sat closest 
to the account of creation, he himself was closest to that of the death of Moses. And when 
the scroll of the Torah had been completely read, the scroll of the Torah became the body 
of Moses once again, and they clothed it and set a girdle around it. That is when Hayim 
Vital awoke, and for hours afterward it seemed to him as if the soul of Moses was present 
in that very room. 

This astonishing dream of Hayim Vital shows the close link in the Jewish mind be- 
tween the Torah of Moses and Moses himself. In the dream the body of Moses is brought 
to the synagogue on Simhat Torah, which follows the seventh day of Sukkot and is a 
day of rejoicing. On Simhat Torah the year-long reading of the Torah comes to an end 
with the last few verses of the Book of Deuteronomy and starts again with the first 
verses of the Book of Genesis. This explains Hayim Vital's focus on the end of 
Deuteronomy and the beginning of Genesis. Note that the death of Moses is part of the 
Sephardic liturgy for Simhat Torah, and this may have inspired Hayim Vital's dream. 

Once the body of Moses, which is of gigantic proportions (as Moses was a giant 
among prophets — B. Berakhot 54b recounts that the body of Moses was ten cubits tall), is 
carried inside and put on a long table, it turns into the scroll of the Torah. Hayim Vital 
sits closest to the end of the Torah, where the account of the death of Moses is found. He 
assumes that because he is closest to this end, he is the closest to Moses. Once the Torah 
has been read from beginning to end, it turns back into the body of Moses. 

Hayim Vital had one of the richest religious imaginations in all of Jewish history, 
and in his dreams and visions the line between mythology and religion is completely 
erased, as here, where the Torah and the body of Moses are one and the same. In his 
writings he strongly hints that his master, the Ari, had a messianic role, and in his 
dreams, visions, and other writings he likewise attributes such a role to himself. In 



302 MYTHS OF THE HOLY TIME 


fact, he makes this connection explicit in his comments on the dream: "This indicates 
there was a cleaving and connection between my soul and that of Moses."

384. THE FLYING SHOE 

Every year the followers of the Ba'al Shem Tov celebrated Simhat Torah with wild danc- 
ing and singing. For on that day the reading of the Torah is begun anew, and Jews dance 
with the Torah in their arms. 

Then one year his Hasidim noticed that the Ba'al Shem Tov did not join in the dancing, 
but stood off by himself. He seemed to be strangely somber on that joyful day. Suddenly 
a shoe flew off the foot of Rabbi Dov Baer as he whirled in the dance, and at that instant 
the Ba'al Shem Tov smiled. 

A little later the Hasidim saw the Ba'al Shem Tov pull a handful of leaves out of his 
pocket, crush them, and scatter their powder in the air, f illin g the room with a wonderful 
scent, like that of Paradise. Then the Ba'al Shem Tov joined in the dancing with great 
abandon. The Hasidim had never seen him so happy, and they, too, felt possessed by a 
greater joy than ever before. 

Afterward, when they had all caught their breath, one of the Hasidim asked the Ba'al 
Shem Tov what he had smiled about, after having been so solemn. He replied: "While you 
were dancing, I went into a trance, and my soul leaped from here into the Garden of Eden. 
I went there to bring back leaves from the Garden, so that I could scatter them among us, 
making this the happiest Simhat Torah of all time. I gathered fallen leaves with the greatest 
pleasure and put them in my pocket. As I did, I noticed that there were scattered fringes of 
prayer shawls in the Garden, as well as pieces of worn tefillin, from the straps Jews wrap 
around their arm when they pray. Not only that, but I saw heels and soles and shoelaces, 
and sometimes even whole shoes. And all of these objects were glowing like so many sparks, 
even the shoes— for as soon as they entered the Garden of Eden, they began to glow. 

"Now I was not surprised to see the fringes and straps, for they come from sacred 
objects, but I wondered what the shoes were doing there. 

"Just then a shoe flew into the Garden of Eden, and I recognized it at once as that of 
Rabbi Dov Baer. The Ba al Shem Tov turned to face him. "Dov, I realized that your love 
of God was so great that your shoe had flown all the way there. That is when I under- 
stood why there were shoes in the Garden of Eden. And that is why I smiled. 

"I would have come back to join you at that very moment, but just then I saw two 
angels in the Garden. They had come to sweep and clean the Garden and to gather those 
precious, glowing objects. 

"I asked the angels what they were going to do with the shoes, and one of them said: 
'These shoes have flown here from the feet of Jews dancing with the Torah. They are very 
precious to God, and soon the angel Gabriel will make a crown out of them for God to 
wear on His Throne of Glory.'" 

The Ba'al Shem Tov stopped speaking, and all who heard this story that day were 
filled with awe. Nor was Rabbi Dov Baer's shoe ever seen again, for it had truly flown to 
the Garden of Eden. 

Simhat Torah follows the seventh day of Sukkot and is a day of rejoicing. On Simhat 
Torah, the year-long reading of the Torah comes to an end with the last few verses of the 



MYTHS OF PASSOVER 303 


Book of Deuteronomy and starts again with the first verses of the Book of Genesis. The 
scrolls of the Torah are taken from the Ark and carried around the synagogue in a pro- 
cession that makes seven circuits around the sanctuary. After each circuit, there is sing- 
ing and dancing with the scrolls. It is a celebration of great joy for having lived to complete 
the reading of the Torah for another year. In some Hasidic circles, there is wild dancing, 
as in this tale about the Ba'al Shem Tov and Rabbi Dov Baer (1710-1772). 

Although the gates of the Garden were closed after Adam and Eve were expelled, 
there are quite a few visits to the Garden recounted in Jewish folklore, such as that of 
the Ba'al Shem Tov in this story. This shows how Jewish folktales draw on biblical 
themes and retell them, perpetuating the influence of the Bible in Jewish tradition. 

The theme of leaves from the Garden of Eden is a popular one in Jewish folklore.

385. GOD REVELS IN THE READING OF THE HAGGADAH 

On the night of Passover, while Jews around the world read from the Haggadah, God 
gathers His household together, and says, "Come and listen to the recital of My praises 
as My children rejoice in their redemption from slavery in Egypt." And all of heaven 
assemble and hear Israel praise God for all the miracles He had performed. 

Hearing these praises, God gains additional strength and power in the world above. 
Thus the children of Israel give strength to their Master, and His glory is exalted on high. 
That is why everyone must narrate the miracles and speak in God's presence of all He 
has done, for these words ascend, and the celestial house takes note of them, and God's 
glory is exalted both above and below. 

On Passover it is a requirement to read from the Haggadah , which narrates the Exo- 
dus from Egyptian slavery. The Haggadah gives the credit for the Exodus to God, only 
mentioning Moses once. This myth portrays God as reveling in the praises of Israel as 
they read from the Haggadah. It presents the kabbalistic concept of mutuality between 
God and Israel, where God does not only benefit Israel, but Israel's praise and prayers 
benefit God, who is said to gain strength and power from them.

386. THE DANCING OF THE ARI 

Every Lag ba-Omer the Ari led his students to the grave of Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai in 
Meron. And there they danced at the resting place of the holy rabbi. 

Now one Lag ba-Omer, an old man danced with them. He could be seen swaying at 
the outer edge of the circle, as if he were being carried on waves of song. He had a beau- 
tiful white beard and was dressed all in white, with a white prayer shawl covering his 
head. His eyes were closed, and his whole body radiated mystical glory. 

All at once, the Ari took his hand and started dancing with him. A great light shone 
between them, a sacred radiance, like the light of many candles, tinged with blue and 
gold. All the students watched spellbound as the Ari and the old man danced. 



304 MYTHS OF THE HOLY TIME 


Their dancing lasted for hours. It was well after midnight when they stopped, and the 
old man took his leave. Then the disciples of the Ari crowded around him to learn the 
identity of the old man. And he told them that it was none other than Shimon bar Yohai 
himself who had joined in the celebration. 

On Lag ba-Omer campfires are lit all over Israel, but especially in the Galilee, in 
honor of Shimon bar Yohai. It was the custom of the Ari to go to the grave of Shimon 
bar Yohai in Meron to celebrate Lag ba-Omer. Here, while the Ari and his disciples 
dance and sing, they are joined by a mysterious old man, whom the Ari recognizes as 
Shimon bar Yohai. This tale links the greatness of the Ari and of Shimon bar Yohai, 
who are, in fact, the two primary sages associated with the Galilee. In this respect it is 
a kind of succession tale, showing that Shimon bar Yohai has selected the Ari to be his 
successor. This confirms the Ari's importance to be equal to that of Shimon bar Yohai, 
legendary author of the Zohar as well as the principal hero of its tales. This tale and 
others about the circle of the Ari collected by the Israel Folktale Archives demonstrate 
that the tradition still exists in the city of Safed in present day Israel.

387. THE WEDDING OF GOD AND THE SHEKHINAH 

When they are first engaged, God sends His betrothed nuptial presents and a meal of 
celestial bread. So too does He make preparations for the wedding feast. On the eve of 
Shavuot, before the wedding takes place, the members of the heavenly household re- 
main with the Bride all night, and rejoice in the preparations for the wedding. They study 
Torah, progressing from the Five Books of Moses to the Prophets, and from the Prophets 
to the Writings, and then to the midrashic and mystical interpretation of the text, for 
these are the adornments and finery of the Bride. 

Throughout the night, the Bride rejoices with Her maidens and is made ready by them. 
And in the morning She enters the bridal canopy, illumined with the radiance of sap- 
phire, which shines from one end of the world to the other. Shining in all Her finery, she 
awaits each of those who helped to prepare Her. And at the moment when the sun enters 
the bridal canopy and illumines Her, all Her companions are identified by name. And 
God inquires after them, and blesses them, and crowns them with bridal crowns, and 
blessed is their portion. 

Then the Bridegroom enters the bridal canopy, and He offers the seven nuptial bless- 
ings and unites with His Bride, joining with the Queen in perfect union, and the heavens 
declare the glory of God (Ps. 19:2). 

This Shavuot myth describes the wedding of God and the Shekhinah. Since Shavuot 
commemorates the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai, it is the appropriate time for 
the wedding of God and the Shekhinah . The night of Shavuot is traditionally devoted 
to Torah study, including study of the mystical texts, and here that study is identified 
as the adornments of the Bride. Thus the scholars who study on the night of Shavuot 
are identified here as members of the heavenly household who remain with the Bride 
all night and assist Her in preparing for the wedding. 

The myth that follows, also a Shavuot myth, describes the wedding of God and 
Israel. Both versions are quite common, although the wedding of God and Israel, be- 
cause of its appearance in the Sephardic Mahzor (holiday prayerbook), is the better- 
known myth. 



MYTHS OF SHAVUOT 305 


Note, as well, a remnant of a sun myth — the entrance of the Bride of God into the 
bridal canopy is described in terms of the sun rising. Thus the Shekhinah is also linked 
to the sun, as well as to the moon. Other remnants of sun myths can be found in the 
transformation of Enoch into Metatron, where Metatron is described in terms identi- 
cal to the sun.

388. THE WEDDING OF GOD AND ISRAEL 

On Friday, the sixth of Sivan, the day appointed by the Lord for the revelation of the 
Torah to His beloved people, God came forth from Mount Sinai. The Groom, the Lord, 
the King of Hosts, is betrothed to the bride, the community of Israel, arrayed in beauty. 
The Bridegroom said to the pious and virtuous maiden, Israel, who had won His favor 
above all others: "Can there be a bridal canopy without a bride? As I live — declares the 
Lord — you shall don them all like jewels, deck yourself with them like a bride" (Isa. 49:18). Many 
days will you be Mine and I will be your Redeemer. Be My mate according to the law of 
Moses and Israel, and I will honor, support and maintain you, and be your shelter and 
refuge in everlasting mercy. And I will set aside the life-giving Torah for you, by which 
you and your children will live in health and tranquility. This Covenant shall be valid 
and binding forever and ever." 

Thus an eternal Covenant, binding them forever, has been established between them, 
and the Bridegroom and the bride have given their oaths to carry it out. May the Bride- 
groom rejoice with the bride whom he Has taken as His lot, and may the bride rejoice 
with the Husband of her youth. 

In the Talmud there is a brief description of the marriage of God and Israel: "The 
Groom, the Lord, the King of Hosts, is betrothed to the bride, the community of Israel, 
arrayed in beauty" (B. Pesahim 106a). Since all weddings are required to have a ketubah, 
a wedding contract, the present myth, "The Wedding of God and Israel" provides the 
wedding contract for that wedding. Its text serves as a hymn for Shavuot. This liturgi- 
cal poem, found in the Sephardic prayer book for Shavuot, is based on the verses, "I 
will espouse you with righteousness and justice , and with goodness and mercy, and I will 
espouse you with faithfulness ; then you shall be devoted to the Lord" (Hos. 2:21-22), and "I 
will make a new covenant with the house of Israel" (Jer. 31:31). 

The text of this ketubah is read on Shavuot, usually in Ladino, from the Sephardic 
holiday prayer book, or Mahzor. It describes the Giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai as 
the wedding between God and Israel that is indicated by the verse "See, a time is com- 
ing" — declares Yahweh — " when I will make a new covenant with the House of Israel and the 
House of Judah" (Jer. 31:31). Here God and Israel are personified as a Bridegroom and 
bride, and the Torah is presented as the ketubah, or wedding contract, between them. 

The marriage takes place on the sixth of Sivan, the holiday of Shavuot, when, tradi- 
tionally, the Torah was said to have been given. 

Here the wedding that takes place on the Sabbath is not between God and the Shekhinah; 
instead, it is between God and Israel, with the ketubah serving as the wedding contract 
between them. The fact that the wedding takes place on Shavuot demonstrates the link- 
age of the Torah, given on Shavuot, to this bond. It is the Torah that both affirms the 
Covenant between God and Israel and also binds them together. Indeed, the ketubah that 
is read symbolically represents the Torah in much the same way as do the Ten Command- 
ments. This text can be viewed both mythologically as the wedding between God and 
Israel, and allegorically, suggesting that the Torah can be viewed as a contract between 
God and Israel in the same way that a ketubah serves as a contract between man and wife. 



306 MYTHS OF THE HOLY TIME 


Deuteronomy Rabbah 3:12 states that it was Moses who wrote the ketubah between 
God and Israel, based on the verse And Moses wrote this Law (Deut. 31 :9). God is said to 
have rewarded Moses for doing this by giving him a luminous countenance. As for 
the scroll tiiat Moses wrote the ketubah on, the same source in Deuteronomy Rabbah 
describes it as made of a parchment of white fire, which was written on with black 
fire. Of course, this ketubah is none other than the scroll of the Torah itself. 

It is important to observe that God is masculine and the Shekhinah, feminine. An 
interesting parallel is found in Greek myth, where Uranus, whose name came to mean 
the sky, is masculine, and Gaia, who is Mother Earth, is feminine. In both cases, the 
feminine goddess figures are linked to the earth: the Shekhinah represents God's pres- 
ence in this world, especially with the Temple in Jerusalem, and Gaia is, at the same 
time, the personification of the earth. The primary difference between them is that 
God's Bride is an invisible, supernatural being, while Gaia represents not only a god- 
dess, but also the life-sustaining earth. Both pairs of gods and goddesses associate the 
masculine with the heavens, and the feminine with the earth. See The Greek Myths by 
Robert Graves, 3.1. 

God is portrayed as being wed to three different brides in various Jewish myths: to 
the Shekhinah (see "The Wedding of God and the Shekhinah , p. 304), to Israel (as re- 
counted here), and, remarkably enough, to Lilith (see "Lilith Becomes God's Bride," 
p. 59). In most myths God is presented as being married to the Shekhinah.

389. THE PARTING OF THE HEAVENS AT MIDNIGHT 

It is said that at midnight, on the night of Shavuot, the skies part, and the glory of heaven 
is revealed. Then anyone who makes a wish at that instant will have that wish come true. 
That is why students stay up all night studying the Torah, so that they will be awake 
when the skies part, and be worthy of viewing God’s glory at that instant. 

Just as the parting of the Red Sea is the key moment of the Exodus, celebrated at 
Passover, so the folk tradition of the parting of the heavens at midnight is linked with 
Shavuot (and sometimes Sukkot). The possibility of this miracle taking place is in- 
tended to motivate students to stay up all night studying. Shavuot represents the day 
the Torah was given, which was the defining moment in the history of Judaism. It was 
a kabbalistic custom to study the entire night of Shavuot. The text that is traditionally 
studied is the Zohar, the central text of Jewish mysticism, and the whole night of study 
is regarded as a ceremony of purification. The culmination of this ceremonial study is 
the revelation that takes place at the instant the skies open, revealing the glory of the 
Shekhinah to those worthy of seeing it. This miracle of the skies opening is also found 
as a theme in Jewish folklore, in which wishes are often made at the instant the skies 
open. These wishes, of course, always come true.

390. THE CREATION OF THE SABBATH 

The Sabbath was last to be created, but first in God's mind. It was the culmination of all 
creation. Indeed, everything exists for the sake of the Sabbath. The Sabbath is the source 
of all blessings. 



MYTHS OF THE SABBATH 307 


Before God gave the commandment of keeping the Sabbath to Israel, He said to Moses: 
"I have a good present in my secret chambers. The name of that present is 'Sabbath.' Go 
tell the people that I now wish to give that present to them." 

The Sabbath takes on even greater significance in this myth. It is more than a ritual 
day of rest, it is the original purpose of creation, itself a source of blessings. Here the 
Sabbath comes close to existing as an independent divine being, a goddess disguised 
as the seventh day. 

The Sabbath is also presented as a gift taken out of God's secret chambers. It is that 
precious. In both views the Sabbath is seen as the epitome of God's blessings, as well 
as a reminder of how the world was created, and who created it. 

Each of these interpretations fuses with the already potent symbol of the Sabbath 
and adds to its mythic aura.

391. THE COSMIC SABBATH 

There will be seven cosmic eons in all, each lasting seven thousand years. In the present 
era, God's commandments are a necessity. But in the preceding eon there was neither 
desire nor reward and punishment, and a different law prevailed. 

At the end of the sixth eon, on the eve of the cosmic Sabbath, light will swallow death 
and drive unclean spirits from the world. Then everyone, great and small, will know 
God by the light that emanates from the mystery of divine thought. 

When the cosmic Sabbath begins, a new Torah will go forth, and a new cosmic law will 
prevail. Wisdom and knowledge will increase among men. The letters of the Torah will 
combine in a new way and take on a new meaning, but not a single letter will be added or 
taken away. 

Each of the eras of existence is known as a Shemittah, an era lasting 7,000 years. The 
cosmic eras of this myth find their source in the story of the creation, in which the 
seventh day is a day of rest, as well as in the agricultural law also known as Shemittah 
in which fields must lie fallow every seventh year (Exod. 23:10-11; Lev. 25:1-7, 18-22; 

Deut. 15:1-11). 

The Torah of the present era, known as the Torah of Creation, is different from that 
of the preceding or subsequent eras. The Torah of the past and future eras is known as 
the Torah of Divine Emanation. The suggestion that the Torah is somehow different in 
different eras echoes the idea that God will give a new Torah to Israel in the messianic 
era, which will be different from the present Torah. 

Some versions of this myth insist, as does this one, that "not a single letter will be 
added or taken away." On the other hand, the myth of the twenty-third letter of the 
Hebrew alphabet asserts that there was an additional, although invisible, twenty-third 
letter from the beginning. It will only be revealed in the messianic era, and that will be 
the genesis of the new Torah, which will be given through the Messiah as the Torah 
given at Mount Sinai was given to Moses. See "A New Torah," p. 522.

On this day the sound of rejoicing and delight is heard throughout the world, and 
pleasure and joy abound. 

On this day a breath of delight spreads throughout all the world, so that all those who 
observe the Sabbath can enjoy perfect rest. 

On this day all negative judgments are suppressed, and even the wicked in Gehenna 
are at ease. All powers of negativity vanish and no other power reigns in any of the 
worlds. 

On this day the voice of a herald proclaims, "Arise, O celestial ones, arise, O holy 
people, arise in perfect joy to meet your Master! Blessed is your portion, Israel, in this 
world and the World to Come." 

Therefore all blessings above and below depend on the seventh day. For the Sabbath is 
equal in worth to the whole of the Torah, and whoever keeps the Sabbath is like one who 
keeps all of the Torah. 

This kabbalistic myth emphasizes the holiness of the Sabbath in heaven as well as 
on earth. The Zohar emphasizes that although the individual acts of creation were 
finished, the world was not perfect until the seventh day. That is why it is stated that 
God completed His work on the seventh day (Gen. 2:2). So potent is the blessing of the 
Sabbath that its delight spreads throughout the world and even cancels negative de- 
crees, such as the punishments of Gehenna. So crucial is keeping the Sabbath that 
doing so it is said to be the equivalent of honoring all of the laws of the Torah.

393. THE ADORNMENT OF THE SABBATH 

On the Sabbath, when the Torah is crowned, it is adorned with all the commandments, 
with all the decrees and punishments, and with the seventy branches of light, which 
shine on every side. Branches grow from every branch, and gates are open on every side, 
all of them shining and resplendent with light. 

Here the Sabbath is being adorned like a bride, but not in jewels, but in the com- 
mandments, and the Sabbath day is viewed as if it were a wedding. Indeed, it is a 
sacred duty to make love on Friday night. This is also expressed as sleeping under the 
shelter of the Shekhinah, who is also the Sabbath Queen. See "The Sabbath Bride " d 
309. '

394. THE PRINCESS OF THE SABBATH 

After completing the work of Creation during the first six days, God ascended to the heaven 
called Habitation of Joy, to sit on His celestial throne. As He arrived, all the angelic princes 
appointed over the cosmos came before Him— rejoicing, dancing, and singing. 



MYTHS OF THE SABBATH 309 


At that moment, God ushered in the princess of the Sabbath and sat her alongside 
Him. He brought every prince of heaven before her. They danced and exulted before her, 
saying, "The Sabbath , she is the Lord's " (Lev. 23:3). God even lifted up Adam to the heights 
of the highest heavens to regale her and rejoice in the Sabbath's joy. 

During the week the princess of the Sabbath wears special garments, but on the Sab- 
bath she wears two layers of lovely garments, the raiment of the upper worlds, for each 
word of Sabbath prayer bedecks and adorns the bride. Thus she is crowned from above 
and below, as heaven celebrates and the holy people of Israel bless her with joy and with 
their prayers. 

As many myths have emphasized, the Sabbath is not only celebrated on earth, but 
also in heaven. Here the Sabbath, personified as a princess (one of the incarnations of 
the Shekhinah) is at the center of a great heavenly celebration that takes place at the 
end of the six days of Creation. This is nothing less than an enthronement myth, and 
should be considered along with the other enthronement myths found about Adam, 
Enoch/ Meta tron, Jacob, Moses, King David, and the Messiah. That the ceremony takes 
place during the first Sabbath indicates its significance. It can be understood to per- 
manently establish the central role of both the Shekhinah and the Sabbath in ruling 
heaven and earth. See " The Enthronement of Adam," p. 131; "The Metamorphosis 
and Enthronement of Enoch," p. 156; "Jacob the Divine," p. 366; "The Enthronement 
of Moses, p. 388; "King David is Crowned in Heaven," p. 395; and "The Enthrone- 
ment of the Messiah," p. 487.

395. THE SABBATH BRIDE 

Every seventh day her coronation takes place. Before the start of the ceremony, the dwell- 
ing place is prepared like the chamber of a Bridegroom set to receive his Bride. Mean- 
while, the Bride herself remains alone, separated from the forces of evil. There she adorns 
herself with a crown for the Holy King, and prepares herself for their union. Then, as the 
Sabbath begins, the radiant Bride is escorted by angels on high and Israel below, and she 
is ushered into Israel's abode, to be in their midst. There she is crowned by the prayers of 
the holy people, and they, in turn, are adorned with new souls, so that they all are united 
above and below. 

This describes a mythical ceremony that is part coronation and part wedding be- 
tween God and His Bride, the Shekhinah. The union, clearly intended to be understood 
as a sexual union, between God and His Bride, comes close to portraying them as 
independent mythic beings. This one passage from the Zohar can be subjected to many 
interpretations. It might be viewed as a union between two of the ten sefirot, those 
representing the marriage of the King and His Bride. At the same time, it is also an 
enthronement myth as well as a wedding. This heavenly ceremony is paralleled on 
earth by the ritual of Kabbalat Shabbat , going out to greet the Sabbath Queen at the 
beginning of the Sabbath. The Ari and his followers wore white, and left the city of 
Safed to go out into the fields to welcome the Sabbath Queen. Thus heaven turns to 
earth and earth to heaven, and they meet in a rare union of peace, which is the Sab- 
bath. See the next entry, "Greeting the Sabbath Queen."

396. GREETING THE SABBATH QUEEN 

It was the custom of some of the rabbis to greet the Sabbath Queen. Just before the sun set 
on the Sabbath, Rabbi Haninah would wrap himself in his robe, stand up, and say, "Come, 
let us go to greet the Sabbath Queen." So too did Rabbi Yannai put on his festive gar- 
•' ments on the eve of the Sabbath and say, "Come, O Bride! Come, O Bride!" 

And every Sabbath eve, at sunset, the Ari led his students to greet the Sabbath Queen 
as she descended the rolling hills outside of Safed. When they arrived at the hills, they 
began to sing the songs greeting the Sabbath Queen. And the melodies of those songs 
were carried upward on the wings of prayer, and formed a beautiful garland of prayers 
that the Sabbath Queen carried with her as she descended from on high. Many were 
those who saw them leaving Safed, every one dressed in white, and later saw them re- 
turning, singing Sabbath songs. 

The Ari based the Sabbath ritual of Kabbalat Shabbat on the two talmudic accounts 
of rabbis welcoming the Sabbath Queen. This custom is echoed today on the Sabbath 
evening when, before reciting the last stanza of Lekhah Dodi, the congregation turns 
around to face the door of the synagogue and recites "Bo'i b'shalom" ("Come in peace") 
while standing, thus welcoming the Sabbath Queen. The purpose of this ritual is to 
honor the Sabbath, which is ushered in at this point. Lekhah Dodi itself is a poem com- 
posed by Shlomo Alkabetz of the Ari's circle, which celebrates the arrival of the Sab- 
bath Queen on the Sabbath.

397. THE SECOND SOUL 

All the souls of Israel are crowned on the eve of the Sabbath. For every Sabbath God gives 
the children of Israel an additional soul, a celestial soul, a holy spirit more sublime than any 
other, brimming over with blessing, with song and jubilation drawn from on high. When 
one of these spirits is present, a person's power of understanding is greatly increased. And 
this additional soul remains throughout the Sabbath. Indeed, the name of this soul is "Sab- 
bath," because Sabbath rest and peace are a foretaste of the World to Come. 

Some say these extra souls bloom forth from the Tree of Life, while others say that they 
are the offspring of the Shekhinah, who descends and spreads Her wings over Israel, form- 
ing a canopy of peace as She watches over them, sheltering them as a mother bird does 
her fledglings. As the Shekhinah hovers over them, wings outstretched. She brings forth 
new souls for each and every person. As this spirit descends, it bathes in the spices of the 
Garden of Eden and then settles upon the holy people of Israel. With the arrival of this 
Sabbath-soul all sadness and anger disappear, and joy reigns above and below. 

All during the Sabbath day the extra spirit dwells within, enchanting a person's soul. 
But on Saturday night, when three stars have appeared, the Sabbath soul flies forth and 
returns to its place on high. 



MYTHS OF THE SABBATH 311 


The second soul that arrives on the Sabbath is the neshamah yeterah. Linkage be- 
tween this second soul and the presence of the Shekhinah on the Sabbath is found in 
Sefer ha-Bahir, as well as in the Zohar, where the Shekhinah is identified as the dwelling 
place of the soul. The extra soul can be seen as the inner recognition of the presence, or 
immanence, of God, the inner experience of the Shekhinah. This myth confirms the 
great sense of holiness observant Jews experience in performing their rituals, a sense 
of the sacred that is virtually palpable. 

There is a special ceremony for the end of the Sabbath known as Havdalah, which 
includes the smelling of fragrant spices (to revive a person who has just lost his sec- 
ond soul), that symbolizes the great reluctance to see the Sabbath end. In fact, some 
Hasidim delayed performing Havdalah as long as possible — until midnight or even 
later, although it is supposed to be said at the end of the Sabbath when three stars can 
be seen in the sky. One Hasidic sect even delayed saying Havdalah until Wednesday, 
and then started making immediate plans to prepare for the next Sabbath. 

In B'nei Yisakhar, Rabbi Tzvi Elimelekh's mystical commentary on the Sabbath, he 
develops a theory about the place of the Sabbath in the worlds above and below, the 
worlds of God and humanity, and of the interaction between the two. Here he describes 
the arrival of the second soul as kindling the inner light that comes with the Sabbath. 

Zohar 1:60a states that every Tzaddik (righteous man) has two souls, one in this 
world and one in the world to come. This is a variant of the concept of the Sabbath 
soul, but unlike the neshamah yeterah that departs at the end of the Sabbath, this sec- 
ond, heavenly soul continues to exist at all times. This notion of a second, heavenly 
soul was drawn upon by the Lubavitch movement to explain how their human Rebbe 
could also be the divine Messiah. See "The Descent of the Messiah's Soul," p. 486. 
Zohar 1:78b identifies these two souls as levels of the soul, and in fact there are five 
recognized levels of the soul, three tied to the earthly body and two higher souls. The 
three earthly souls are known as nefesh (the animal soul), ruah (breath or spirit), and 
neshamah (soul). The higher levels are hay ah (which gazes upon God) and yehidah (which 
is bound to God). A further discussion of the three earthly souls can be found in Midrash 
ha-Ne'elam, Zohar Hadash 17c-d. Zohar 1:78b also interprets the fact that God often calls 
righteous men twice — as "Abraham, Abraham" (Gen. 22:11), "Jacob, Jacob" (Gen. 46:2), 
or "Moses, Moses" (Exod. 3:4) — as an indication of His addressing these two primary 
souls, the higher and the lower. 

See "Why Women Light Two Candles on the Sabbath," p. 318, which links the light- 
ing of the Sabbath candles with the second soul.

398. THE SOULS OF THE DEAD ON THE SABBATH 

Every Sabbath the dead rise from their graves and come before God. There is a brook that 
flows from the Garden of Eden, and by the side of this brook, a field. On every Sabbath 
eve, between the afternoon and evening prayers, the souls of the dead go forth from their 
secret abode and drink from this brook. 

When the evening prayers begin, the dead return to their graves, and God revives 
them, and causes them all to stand on their feet, alive. Then great multitudes come before 
God and sing praises to Him, and go into synagogues, where they prostrate themselves 
before God. 



312 MYTHS OF THE HOLY TIME 


This myth of the revival of the dead concerns the souls of the righteous who make 
their home in the Garden of Eden. Here the dead are described as making their homes in 
their graves, while in other sources the souls of the dead leave their graves for good 
within a year after they have died. The strange wandering of the souls of the dead on 
the Sabbath (and, according to some sources, the new moon) derives from the interpre- 
tation of the biblical verse: The people of the land shall worship before the Lord on Sabbaths 
and new moons (Ezek. 46:3). Even the souls being punished in Gehenna are released for 
the duration of the Sabbath. See Sabbath in Gehenna, " p. 238. In the Ezekiel verse "the 
people of the land" (am ha-aretz) is interpreted to refer to "those hidden in the earth," 
i.e., the dead, instead of the more obvious meaning of "the common people." Note that 
the revival of the dead in this myth is not identical with the resurrection of the dead that 
is to take place in the messianic era. This revival is temporary, and ends with the end of 
the Sabbath, while that of the messianic era is permanent. The fate of the righteous on 
the Sabbath is different, however. B. Berakhot 18a states that "In their death, the righ- 
teous are called living." And in B. Ketubot 103a it is said that after his death Rabbi 
Judah ha-Nasi used to visit his earthly home at twilight on every Sabbath, wearing his 
best clothes, and recited Kiddush for his family like a living person.

399. THE SOUL IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN 

When Jews keep the Sabbath, their souls enter the Garden of Eden. Together with the 
pure souls and the souls of the righteous that inhabit that realm, the soul of the Jew 
delights in the light of the Garden and feels the bliss emanating from the radiance of 
supernal love. In this way the soul enjoys the bliss of Paradise that the Sabbath brings. 

This supernal bliss is felt both within and without the body, and is drawn into this world. 
Indeed, the flavor of the Sabbath is even absorbed into the food that is tasted on that day. 
That is why it is said: "We have a certain spice; Sabbath is its name. Whoever keeps the 
Sabbath is affected by it and whoever does not keep the Sabbath is not affected by it." 

On the Sabbath, Jewish souls are said to ascend to Gan Eden , the Garden of Eden, which 
is already inhabited by the "pure souls"— that is, souls in the garden that never partici- 
pated in the tasting of the forbidden fruit — as well as the souls of the righteous who make 
their home there. While the body of the Jew celebrating the Sabbath is on earth, his or her 
soul is in heaven, for Gan Eden refers to the celestial Paradise. This explains why the Sab- 
bath meal has such an exceptional flavor and why the Sabbath itself is a delight.

400. GOD'S DAUGHTER 

The Sabbath is God's daughter, begotten by God alone, without begetting — brought to 
birth, but not carried in the womb. 

The Sabbath said before God: "Master of the Universe! You have given a mate to ev- 
eryone except me. Each of the days of the week has a mate, but I have none." God re- 
plied: "The people of Israel are your mate." 

And when Israel stood before Mount Sinai, Moses saw that the Sabbath was lovely, 
and that she was a virgin. With his keener vision, he saw the marvelous beauty of the 
Sabbath stamped upon heaven and earth, and enshrined in nature itself. 

Here Philo offers an allegory in which the Sabbath is described as God's daughter. 

The purpose of the allegory is to indicate the importance of the Sabbath to God and to 



MYTHS OF THE SABBATH 313 


the people of Israel, who observe the Sabbath. Later rabbinic and kabbalistic develop- 
ment linked the Sabbath with the figure of the Sabbath Queen, one of the personifica- 
tions of the Shekhinah. Such developments also identified the Shekhinah as God's Bride. 
Thus Philo's identification of the Sabbath as God's daughter may be seen to prefigure 
later mythic developments found in Sefer ha-Bahir, where the Shekhinah is portrayed as 
"Daughter, Sister, Wife, and Mother," as the title of Peter Schafer's article puts it, and 
in the Zohar and other kabbalistic texts. In Philo's version of the myth, God gives the 
Sabbath to Israel the way a father gives away his daughter at her wedding.

401. GOD GUIDES MOSES IN PRAYER 

Early in the morning Moses went to Mount Sinai as the Lord had commanded him, and 
took in his hand two tablets of stone. Yahweh came down in a cloud ; He stood with him there , 
and proclaimed the name Yahweh (Exod. 34:5). And God drew His robe around Him like the 
reader of a congregation and showed Moses the order of prayer, and taught him the 
Thirteen Attributes of God. And Moses made haste , and bowed his head toward the earth , and 
worshipped (Exod. 34:8). 

The biblical account of God descending to Moses is amplified and transformed in 
the Talmud, where God is described drawing His robe around Him as was the custom 
of the reader in a congregation. This image grows out of the fact that the Thirteen 
Attributes of God are incorporated into the prayer service, and the meeting of God 
and Moses on the top of Mount Sinai is here transformed into the terms find perspec- 
tive of the synagogue or house of study, where God shows Moses the order of the 
prayers, and explains His own Thirteen Attributes to him. The biblical passage itself 
is a daring one, with God coming down to earth as did the pagan gods. The talmudic 
addition humanizes it further, portraying God in the role of a rabbi /teacher or even a 
fellow congregant. 

The Thirteen Attributes of God are verses from Exodus 34:6-7 th at are read on fast 
days and at other times. According to the Talmud, God is said to have revealed them 
after Moses pleaded on behalf of Israel because of the transgression of the golden calf. 

In this way God was explaining that whenever Israel sins, if they recite this prayer, 

God will forgive them. Therefore a covenant was made with the Thirteen Attributes, 
that the people would not be turned away empty-handed, as it is said. Behold , I make a 
covenant (Exod. 34:10). 

Targum Pseudo-Yonathan on Exodus 34:5-6 states that rather than God revealing 
Himself to Moses, it is the Shekhinah that is revealed: "The Lord revealed Himself in 
the clouds of the Glory of His Shekhinah .... The Lord caused His Shekhinah to pass 
before him." This suggests that the translator was uncomfortable with God having 
revealed Himself so directly to Moses, and instead turned to the tradition of the 
Shekhinah as God's Presence in this world. 

Targum Pseudo-Yonathan on Exodus 33:5, quotes God as saying, "Were I to remove 
the Glory of My Shekhinah for one short moment among you, the world would come 
to an end."

402. THE FIRST SABBATH 

The first Sabbath was also the first New Year's Day. On that day, the first of Tishrei, the 
daylight continued for thirty-six hours, since night did not fall at its set time. For God 
gave the first Sabbath an extra twelve hours of light by holding back the darkness. That is 
the meaning of the verse And God blessed the seventh day (Gen. 2:3). What did God bless it 
with? With an extra measure of light. 

Why did God hold back the darkness? Because of Adam, who was created on the sixth 
day He had never seen the darkness, and God did not want to cause him distress. 

Thus the light of the first Sabbath was like the primordial light of the first day of 
creation, in which it was possible to see from one end of the universe to the other, for on 
both days the light lasted and the darkness was held back. 

Here Rosh ha-Shanah, the New Year, is linked to the first Sabbath, making it the 
birthday of the world. Note that this birthday is not calculated from the first day of 
Creation, but from the day of rest that follows the six days of Creadon. This date is 
identified as the first of Tishrei, which is the day on which Rosh ha-Shanah is celebrated. 

The sun shining for an extra twelve hours so that Adam would not be frightened of 
the darkness adds to the miraculous nature of the first Sabbath.

Pesikta Rabbati 46:1. 


403. GOD KEEPS THE SABBATH 

The Sabbath is not only celebrated on earth, but also in heaven. Soon after the Sabbath 
was created, God said to all the angels of the presence and all the angels of sanctification: 
"We shall keep the Sabbath together in heaven and on earth." 

He said: "Know that I shall separate a people from among all the nations for Myself, 
and they will also keep the Sabbath. And I will sanctify them for Myself, and I will bless 
them. They will be My people and I will be their God. And I have chosen the seed of 
Jacob from among all that I have seen." 

God observed the first Sabbath on the seventh day of Creation (Gen. 2:2), and The 
Book of Jubilees assumed that He has been observing it ever since. This myth offers an- 
other example of how God is portrayed as performing Jewish rituals in heaven. Such a 
myth underscores the importance of the ritual activity, in this case the Sabbath. It also 
underscores the importance of keeping the Sabbath along with God, who observes it in 
heaven. For other examples, see "God Puts on Tallit and Tefillin," p. 34, and "God Stud- 
ies the Torah," p. 34. Note that God also commands the angels to join Him in the Sab- 
bath observance. This creates a heavenly congregation parallel to the earthly one.

The Book of Jubilees 2:18-20; Genesis Rabbah 11:5. 


404. KEEPING THE SABBATH 

God said to Israel, "If you keep the Sabbath, I will count it as if you had kept all the 
commandments of the Torah. But if you violate the Sabbath, I will count it as though you 
had profaned all the commandments. For when a man keeps the Sabbath, it is as though 
he had fulfilled the entire Torah." 



MYTHS OF THE SABBATH 315 


Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy (Exod. 20:8), the commandment for keep- 
ing the Sabbath, is considered to be the most essential commandment, underlining 
the central importance of the Sabbath in Judaism. Here God states that He will con- 
sider keeping the Sabbath to be equal to observing all of the commandments — and 
not keeping the Sabbath as equal to breaking all of the commandments. 

Sources: 

Y. Nedarim 3:9; Exodus Rabbah 25:12. 


405. THE SABBATH ANGELS 

When a man who is praying on the eve of the Sabbath says. The heaven and the earth were 
finished (Gen. 2:1), the two ministering angels who accompany every man place their 
hands on his head and say, " Your guilt shall depart and your siri be purged away " (Isa. 6:7). 

So, too, on the eve of the Sabbath, two angels accompany a man home on Sabbath 
evening after leaving the synagogue: a good angel and an evil on e. When he returns 
home, if he finds the candles bumin^and the table set, and the Bedding properly ar- 
ranged, the good angel says, "So may it be for another Sabbath," and the evil angel is 
forced to reply, "Amen." 

But if everything has not been properly prepared for the Sabbath, the evil angel states, 
"So may it be for another Sabbath," and the good angel has no choice but to say, "Amen." 

And some say that not only the two angels accompany a person from the synagogue 
on the eve of the Sabbath, but that the Shekhinah accompanies him as well, like a mother 
bird sheltering her children. When the Shekhinah sees the candles burning and the angels 
behold the set table, and sees that the husband and wife are filled with joy for the Sab- 
bath, the Shekhinah says, " You are my servant , Israel in whom I glory " (Isa. 49:3). 

But if the candles are not burning, the table is not set and the husband and wife are not 
rejoicing, the Shekhinah departs, taking the angels with Her. Then the forces of evil arrive 
to take their place, and the Evil Inclination proclaims, "This household belongs to me 
and my forces." Then the spirit of defilement rests upon them and even their food is 
rendered impure. 

This is a famous midrash that is intended to remind Jewish families of the impor- 
tance of properly observing the Sabbath. Unless they want the evil angel to have the 
last word, they have to make the proper preparations for the Sabbath. It is customary, 
in both the Sephardic and Ashkenazi traditions, to recite or sing the piyyut or hymn 
Shalom Aleikhem, meaning "peace unto you," on Friday evening after returning from 
the synagogue. This hymn, composed approximately 250 years ago by an unknown 
poet, and introduced into the Sabbath service by the kabbalists, serves as a reminder 
of the cautionary tale of the two Sabbath angels. 

Sha'arei Rahamim explains that the angels are compelled in what they do: "The an- 
gels have no free will of their own, for they are not free agents, but they act solely by 
necessity. If a man is worthy, they must bless him, even against their will, and if he is 
not worthy, they must of necessity curse him."

406. THE SABBATH FEAST IN THE CELESTIAL EDEN 

The angels celebrate the Sabbath in heaven exactly as it is done on earth. Thousands of 
angels gather in the fourth heavenly palace, in the place known as the Chamber of De- 
light. During the festive meal on the night of the Sabbath, Sabbath tables are arranged 
there for the angels, who stand beside their tables, observing the Sabbath. They are watched 
over by a certain heavenly creature, with four seraphim serving under him, who resides 
in the fourth heavenly palace. This creature has been appointed to watch over those who 
rejoice on the Sabbath. And when this creature or one of the seraphim who serve under it 
sees those at a certain table rejoicing over the Sabbath, the heavenly creature blesses and 
protects them and spares them from the River of Fire. The aneelic celebrants, in turn 
reply "Amen." 

But should the heavenly creature see a table that is not rejoicing in proper fashion, 
then the seraphim force those angels outside that chamber, and usher them into a realm 
known as the Chamber of Harm. There, instead of being blessed, they are cursed, and 
there is none to protect them from the River of Fire. 


Here the Sabbath is described as being celebrated in heaven by the angels just as it 
is on earth. And just as human celebrants are judged by two angels (see "The Sabbath 
Angels," p. 315) or by the Shekhinah along with the two angels (ibid.), so here the 
angels are judged by one of the hayyot or heavenly creatures, along with four assistant 
seraphim. The angels receive a blessing from the heavenly creature if their observance 
is appropriate, but are destroyed in the River of Fire if they are found at fault. 

Angels that have somehow displeased God are said to meet their end in the River 
of Fire. This image derives from Daniel 7:10: A river of fire streamed forth before Him. See 
"The River of Fire," p. 158.

407. THE SPICE OF THE SABBATH 

Why is Sabbath food so fragrant? Some say there is a certain spice named Shabbat, and 
when put into food it renders the dish fragrant. And where does that spice come from? 
From the Garden of Eden. 

Ever since they took leave of this world, the patriarch Abraham and his wife, Sarah, 
have made their home in the Garden of Eden. During the week Abraham wanders through 
the Garden and gathers leaves that have fallen from the trees of Eden, especially those of 
the Tree of Life. 

And on the eve of the Sabbath, Sarah crushes those leaves and takes the powder made 
from them and casts it into the wind. And winds guided by angels carry it to the four 
comers of the earth, so that all those who breathe in even the smallest speck have a taste 
of Paradise, and the Sabbath is filled with joy for them. That is the spice of the Sabbath. 

The notion of a spice called Shabbat, that is. Sabbath, is presented satirically in the 
Talmud. When the Emperor Hadrian asks why Sabbath food is so fragrant. Rabbi 
Joshua ben Haninah tells him of such a Sabbath spice, which he said works for anyone 
who keeps the Sabbath, but not for anyone else. Despite the playful quality of his 
comment, the notion of a Sabbath spice entered the tradition, and a folktale about 
Abraham and Sarah living in the Garden of Eden offered an explanation for the spice 
pervading the Sabbath. 



MYTHS OF THE SABBATH 317 


By all accounts the Garden of Eden was enchanted: it had two magic trees in the 
center and a speaking serpent. In later Jewish folklore the Garden of Eden represents 
a place that serves as the goal of many a quest. Here Abraham and Sarah are said to be 
living in the Garden. They appear to be the only inhabitants. How did this folk theme 
arise? There is a double usage of the term Gan Eden in Jewish lore. On the one hand it 
refers to the earthly Garden of Eden as described in Genesis. On the other, it refers to 
Paradise. Of course, Abraham and Sarah were rewarded with Paradise. But since the 
heavenly and the earthly gardens were identified by the same name, the notion arose 
in folk tradition that the Paradise they lived in was the earthly Garden of Eden. There 
Abraham and Sarah offer palpable blessings to their children, the children of Israel, in 
the form of a Sabbath spice made of leaves gathered from the Garden of Eden. 

Here there is an interesting link of three main mythic themes: that of Gan Eden, the 
patriarchs, and the Sabbath. And the story adds a mythic dimension to the belief that 
the Sabbath day, in particular, is blessed. This idea takes many other forms, including 
that of the presence of the Shekhinah on the Sabbath in the form of the Sabbath Queen, 
of Sabbath angels and of the neshamah yeterah, the second soul of the Sabbath. The 
theme of making use of leaves from the Garden of Eden is also found in the folktale 
"Leaves From the Garden of Eden." See Gabriel's Palace, pp. 134-135. 

Another tale about the leaves of the Garden of Eden is found in the Talmud: Elijah 
once led Rabbah bar Avuha to the Garden of Eden and let him in. Elijah told him to take 
off his robe and fill it with leaves. So Rabbah collected leaves from the Garden and was 
about to leave with them when he heard a voice say, "Why would anyone consume his 
portion in the World to Come the way Rabbah has done?" Hearing this, Rabbah shook 
the leaves out of his robe and left them in the Garden and took his leave. When Rabbah 
returned home, he discovered that the fragrance of the leaves still clung to that robe. It 
never faded away. Many were those who sought to purchase it from him, and at last he 
sold it for 12,000 dinars and gave the money to his sons-in-law. The story of the robe of 
Rabbah is found in B. Bava Metzia 114a-b. The myth of the Sabbath spice made from 
leaves from the Garden of Eden is found in Ma'aseh me-ha-Hayyat . 

There is also an extensive tradition concerning patriarchs who never died. There 
are similar types of tales about Jacob, Moses, and David. See "Jacob Never Died," p. 
370. For one about Moses living eternally, see "The Princess and the Slave" in Elijah's 
Violin, pp. 36-43. For stories about David still being alive, see "The Cave of King David" 
in Gabriel's Palace, pp. 139-141.

408. THE SONG OF THE SABBATH 

Angels have six wings, one for each day of the week. And each day they chant a song for 
God. But on the Sabbath they remain silent, for on that day it is the Sabbath itself that 
chants hymns to God. 

Here again the Sabbath is personified, this time as chanting hymns to God on the 
Sabbath. This indicates that the Sabbath is even observed in heaven, and on that day 
the Sabbath takes the place of the angels who chant a song for God every other day of 
the week.

409. ADAM'S SONG OF PRAISE FOR THE SABBATH 

When Adam saw the majesty of the Sabbath and the joy it gave to all beings, he sang a song 
of praise for the Sabbath day (Ps. 92:1). God said to him, "You sang a song of praise to the 
Sabbath, but none to Me, the God of the Sabbath." Then the Sabbath rose from its seat, 
prostrated herself before God, and said. It is a good thing to give thanks to the Lord (Ps. 92 :2 ). 
And all of creation added. And to sing praises to Your Name, O God Most High (Ps. 92:2). 

Here God is portrayed as being jealous of the attention Adam bestows on the Sab- 
bath when he composes the first song of praise for it. But the Sabbath, a day of peace 
as well as a day of rest, resolves the conflict by prostrating herself before God, and 
assuring God it is good for Him to receive praises. This has the effect of sparing Adam 
God's anger. 

Underlying this myth is concern that the Sabbath must never be separated from its 
Creator, and that observing the Sabbath is, in effect, rendering praise to God.

410. WHY WOMEN LIGHT TWO CANDLES ON THE SABBATH 

Some say that women light candles on the Sabbath to repent for the sin of Eve. Because 
she extinguished the primordial light and made the world grow dark, women must kindle 
lights for the Sabbath. 

Others say that because two souls shine on the Sabbath, a person's soul and the neshamah 
yeterah, the second soul that is given on the Sabbath, women light two candles. 

Still others say that women light two candles because the Sabbath is celebrated above 
and below, in heaven as well as on earth. Just as the priest lit seven lamps in the Taber- 
nacle and thereby caused the seven lamps on high to shine, so too does the kindling of 
the Sabbath candles awaken great arousal in the upper world. 

Above all, the two candles are kindled to honor the presence of the Shekhinah, die 
Sabbath Queen, who rests upon the people during the Sabbath. 

This explanation of why women light the Sabbath candles is found in Tkhine imrei 
Shifreh, a collection of women's devotional prayers, written in Yiddish, called tkhines. 

They were written in Yiddish because it was the vernacular, and women often didn't 
know Hebrew. Although there is some scholarly debate about whether various collec- 
tions of these kinds of prayers were composed by women or by men, this collection is 
attributed to a woman, Shifrah Segal of Brody. The rabbinic explanation for the two 
candles describes the lighting of the candles as an act of repentance for the sin of Eve. 

But some tkhines dispute that, offering instead positive reasons for the ritual — to honor 
the two souls of the Sabbath, to awaken Sabbath joy above and below, and to honor 
the Shekhinah, who is said to be present during the Sabbath. 

The description of the lighting of the seven lamps of the Tabernacle is found in 
Numbers 8:2. For more on the myth that the primordial light was withdrawn because 
of the sin of Adam and Eve see "The Light of the First Day," p. 83. For the myth of the 
second soul given on the Sabbath, see "The Second Soul," p. 310.

MYTHS OF THE SABBATH 319 


411. THE FIRST HAVDALAH 

At the close of the first Sabbath, as the sun set, Adam saw darkness creeping upon him, 
and he began to cry out, "Woe is me! Can it be that the serpent is coming to bruise me?" 
Then God gave Adam two stones, one of thick darkness and one of death's shadow. 
Adam took the stones and struck them together until fire shot forth from them. In amaze- 
ment, Adam recited the prayer, "Blessed are You, O God, Who created the light of the 
fire." And those words are still repeated in the Havdalah prayer till this day. 

Others say that a pillar of fire was sent to Adam to illuminate him and to guard him 
from all evil. When Adam saw that pillar of fire, he rejoiced, and he put forth his hands to 
the light of the fire and said, "Blessed are You, O Lord our God, King of the universe. 
Who creates the flames of fire." And when he removed his hands from the light of the 
fire, he said, "Now I know that the holy day has been separated from the work day here 
below, for fire may not be kindled on the Sabbath day." And at that hour he said, "Blessed 
are You, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who divides the holy from the profane, 
the light from the darkness." 

And that is the prayer, till this day, that serves to separate the holy from the profane. 
One must also say the blessing over fire because all fires are concealed on the Sabbath, 
and once this blessing is made, all of the other fires emerge, take their places, and are 
given permission to shine. And when the blessing over fire is made, one must turn one's 
fingernails toward the flame, and let the flames reflect in them. 

One must also smell spices as the Sabbath ends, because when the second soul of the 
Sabbath departs, a person's soul is left naked, bereft of that spirit, and requires the scent 
of the spices to sustain the soul. 

This is a midrashic example of a myth of origin. Never having seen darkness, Adam is 
terrified by its onset, and links it to the danger posed by the serpent of Eden. The identifi- 
cation of the serpent and the darkness derives from Psalms 139:11: Surely darkness will 
bruise me; the same verb, "bruise," is used by the serpent in Genesis 3:15. 

This myth also provides the story behind the creation of the Havdalah ritual that is 
performed at the end of the Sabbath. Havdalah is the ceremony at the end of the Sab- 
bath at which time the Sabbath officially ends, the Sabbath Queen departs, and Jews 
are said to lose their neshamah yeterah, their second soul. 

The rituals of Havdalah are described here: making a blessing over fire, letting the 
flames reflect in the fingernails, and smelling spices to revive oneself and let oneself 
recover from the loss of one's second soul. See "The Second Soul," p. 310.

412. THE SABBATH IN THE WORLD TO COME 

In this world, if a person gathers figs on the Sabbath, the fig tree says nothing about it to 
him. But in the World to Come, if a man should pick fruit from a fig tree on the Sabbath, 
the tree will call out to him and say, "Remember the Sabbath!" 

Work is forbidden on the Sabbath. In fact, there is a very long list of activities that 
constitute work, including picking fruit from trees. This rather tongue-in-cheek myth 
observes that while trees in this world are silent when someone breaks the Sabbath by 
picking their fruit, in the World to Come the tree will loudly protest.

413. THE GREAT SABBATH 

The world is destined to exist for six thousand years. The first two thousand years was 
the time of chaos, the next two thousand years the era of the Torah, and the last two 
thousand years will be the days of the Messiah. After that the world will lie desolate for 
a thousand years, before a new world is created in its place. For just as the seventh year is 
a year of release, so is it for the world: one thousand years out of seven it shall be fallow. 

Now it is known of God that in Your sight a thousand years are like yesterday (Ps. 90:4). There- 
fore six thousand years are but six days in the eyes of God. And just as God created the world 
in six days and then rested, at the end of six millennia the world will cease to exist. 

Some say the world will remain desolate for a thousand years, just as land lies fallow 
every seventh year. But after this the world will be revived, as it is said. He will raise us up, 
and we shall be whole by His favor (Hos. 6:2). 

Others say that the six days of Creation represent all the days of the world, and the 
seventh day is the Great Sabbath, as it is said, a Sabbath of the Lord (Lev. 25:2). That will be 
the Sabbath of His Great Name. For the world as we know it was intended to exist for six 
thousand years: two thousand years without Torah, two thousand years with Torah, and 
two thousand years of the Messiah's reign. 

And just as one year in seven is a sabbatical year of release, so God will provide a day 
of release, a day lasting a thousand years. Thus, in the seventh millennium, the Great 
Sabbath will begin. Then all activity will cease. There will be no food or drink. But each 
and every one of the righteous will rejoice in his understanding of the Torah, and they 
will sit with crowns on their heads and feast off the splendor of the Shekhinah. At the end 
of this Sabbath year of days, the era of the World to Come will be ushered in, when death 
will never, ever again exist. For the World to Come will be wholly a Sabbath and everlast- 
ing rest. 


The Sabbath is said to be a foretaste of the World to Come. This myth, based on an 
interpretation of Leviticus 25:2, about the need to let the land lie fallow every seventh 
year, describes a cosmic Sabbath, known as the Great Sabbath, that will come after 
6,000 years— three ages of 2,000 years each. Just as the seventh day is the Sabbath, the 
day of rest, so for a thousand years there will be no life in this world as we know it, 
but the righteous will reap great rewards in the World to Come. Note that the righ- 
teous are sustained in the World to Come by feasting off the splendor of the Shekhinah. 
Or, in an alternate version, the light they bask in is none other than the primordial 
light, the light of the first day. See "The Light of the First Day/' p. 83. 

In this myth, the existence of the world is said to be limited to six millennia, and 
the longevity of the world is directly tied to the six days of Creation. This explanation 
draws on the verse in Your sight a thousand years are like yesterday (Ps. 90:4), which was 
taken as the precise correlation between time on earth and in heaven. 

Therefore the world that was created in six days will be destroyed at the end of six 
of God's days. Here the key is the symmetry between the six days of Creation and the 
span of the world's existence. This myth makes a distinction between the messianic 
era, which will last 2,000 years in this world, and the Great Sabbath that will follow, 
where all existence in this world will cease for good. In some versions of this myth, 
however, after lying fallow for a thousand years (some say 2,000 years), God will 
renew the world, and life will be revived (B. Sanh. 97a-b). 

In B. Sanhedrin 97b, Rabbi Hanan bar Tahlifa tells of seeing an ancient scroll on 
which was written: "Four thousand two hundred and ninety-one years after its cre- 
ation, the world will be orphaned. The years that follow will see the wars of Gog and 
Magog and the messianic age, but God will not renew the world until after 7,000 
years." 



MYTHS OF THE NINTH OF AV 321 


The kabbalistic doctrine of cosmic cycles, or shemittot, describes three eons of exist- 
ence of 2,000 years each, followed by a thousand years in which the world will lay 
desolate. There is also an alternate theory of seven cosmic cycles, each lasting 7,000 
years.

414. A DAY OF FASTING AND MOURNING 

When the spies went into Canaan and brought back their report of giants, the people 
wept, for they were certain that they would all die by the sword there. The crying spread 
through the whole camp, and God said, "Because the people weep without cause and do 
not trust My word to bring them into a land flowing with milk and honey, this night and 
the following day, the Ninth of Av, shall be a day of fasting and mourning, a day of 
trouble and tribulation for many years. 

This myth concerns the origin of the many tragedies that have come to be associ- 
ated with the Ninth of Av. This includes the destruction of both Temples and many 
other catastrophes. Here the beginning of the curse of the Ninth of Av is traced to the 
report of the spies triggering panic among the people. This fear on their part was an 
affront to God, Who had promised to bring them into that land, provoking God to 
place a curse on the Ninth of Av. This myth is unusual, in that God is rarely portrayed 
making a curse. In fact, one myth describes an angel, Gallizur, whose job it is to utter 
all of God's evil decrees for Him. See "The Angel Gallizur," p. 199.

415. THE MOURNING DOVE 

On the night of the Ninth of Av, while Jews mourn the destruction of the Temple at the 
Wailing Wall in Jerusalem and the sound of their weeping cleaves the heavens, a white dove 
appears in the darkness of the night and joins the people of Israel in their mourning. All night 
it stands at the comer of the Wall, wailing and moaning. Then a heavenly voice is sometimes 
heard, moaning like a dove, saying, "Alas, because of the sins of My sons I destroyed My 
house, I burned My sanctuary, and scattered My children among the nations." 

Here God is said to appear in the form of a white dove at the Kotel, the Western 
Wall of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem that is the only remaining wall of the Temple. 

The dove can be identified with God because, according to Jewish tradition, it was 
God who made the decision to destroy the Temple. In other accounts, this dove is 
identified with the Shekhinah, and is one of the three prominent forms She takes: as a 



322 MYTHS OF THE HOLY TIME 


bride dressed in white; as an old woman dressed in black, deep in mourning; and as a 
white dove mourning at the Wall. According to Zev Vilnay, the tradition of the mourn- 
ing dove at the Wall grows out of the talmudic account in B. Berakhot 3a, in which Rabbi 
Jose, who lived about a century after the destruction of the Temple, prays in a ruin in 
Jerusalem and hears a voice like that of a dove, repeating words of regret at the destruc- 
tion and exile. In later folk accounts, this dove is transferred to the Wall and linked with 
Tisha be-Av, the Ninth of Av, which commemorates the destruction of the two Temples.

416. THE WAILING WALL 

On the night of the Ninth of Av, drops of dew can be seen on the stones of the Wailin g 
Wall, and it is said among the people that the Wall was crying at night for the Temple that 
was tom down. 

Once, when worshippers stood in front of the Wall, pouring out their hearts, water 
began oozing out of the cracks of the Wall, and the people cried out, "The wall is weep- 
ing!" When the news spread among the people, they streamed to the Wall, and women 
collected the tears of the Wall as a precious remedy for many ailments. 

That is why it is said that since the destruction of the Temple, the gates of prayer have 
been closed, but the gates of weeping are open. 

The western retaining wall of the Temple Mount is known as the Kotel, or Western 
Wall, or Wailing Wall. It is the holiest Jewish site in the world, and the focus of visitors 
to Jerusalem, who often pray intensely at the Wall and leave messages to God in the 
cracks of the Wall. 

Why is the Kotel known as the Wailing Wall? The name "Wailing Wall" is perhaps 
an outsider's description based on the passionate weeping of the Jews who pray there, 
since Jews normally call it the Kotel , the Western Wall. This myth, collected orally in 
Israel, provides a different kind of explanation, a miraculous weeping of the wall, still 
grieving over the destruction of the Temple.

B. Berakhot 32b; Aggadot Eretz Yisrael, no. 189. 

417. THE WEEPING WELL 

There is a well in the Temple court known as the Weeping Well. When the Temple was 
destroyed, young people cast themselves in that well to evade the sword. And on the 
Ninth of Av, even to this day, when all are mourning over the destruction of the Temple, 
a great weeping is heard from that well. 

On the same night, a voice of mourning and sighing is said to go forth from the Temple 
site. All who pray there can hear it. And those who hear it are seized with weeping until 
they faint. 

This is a myth of martyrdom, like that about Masada, about a well in the Temple 
court where young people took their lives by casting themselves in the well rather 
than be killed. The well is still weeping over those tragic deaths, as well as for the 
destruction of the Temple. In a broader sense, this myth is about how the tragedy of 
the Temple's destruction still haunts the Jewish people.

418. THE NINTH OF AV IN THE FUTURE 

The Ninth of Av is a time of mourning for the destruction of the two Temples in Jerusa- 
lem and other disasters that have taken place on that same day. But in the future God will 
turn the Ninth of Av into a time of rejoicing. He will rebuild Jerusalem and gather the 
exiles of Israel. Whoever mourns for Jerusalem in this world will rejoice with her in the 
World to Come. 

To convey how radically the messianic era will transform life from the present, this 
myth describes the Ninth of Av in the messianic era as a time of rejoicing instead of 
grieving. The root of this idea is in Zechariah 8:19.

419. REPENTING FOR GOD 

When the Temple in Jerusalem was still standing, a goat was offered up as a sin offering 
on every Rosh Hodesh . This was brought to atone for God's sin. God said: "At first the 
moon was same size as the sun. Later, I decided to make the moon smaller. Now I regret 
doing that. So on every Rosh Hodesh , when the moon is small, bring a sin offering for Me, 
to atone for My act of making the moon smaller." 

The goat offering on Rosh Hodesh is described in Nu mbers 28:1 4-15: This is the burnt- 
offering of every new moon throughout the months Sftfifyear. And one he-goat for a sin- 
offering to Yahweh shall be offered. 

This astonishing myth has God confessing that He has committed a sin, or at least 
an act He regrets — shrinking the size of the moon. The possibility of God's reversing 
the decision is never considered. Even stranger, it is incumbent on the Temple priests 
to atone for God's sin by offering a goat as a sin offering on Rosh Hodesh . Rosh Hodesh 
celebrates the new moon. This, the first day of the month, is the day that the moon 
appears to have shrunken to its smallest size. This shows that Israel does not only 
repent for its own sins, but for the sins of God as well, for which God seeks atone- 
ment. For the myth of the shrinking of the moon, see "The Quarrel of the Sun and the 
Moon," p. 112. See, also, "A Scapegoat for Azazel," p. 295, describing the custom of 
sacrificing a goat to Azazel on Yom Kippur.

MYTHS OF ISRAEL 


420. FOR THE SAKE OF ISRAEL 

The world and everything in it was created only for the sake of Israel. Indeed, all worlds, 
above and below, were only created for the sake of Israel. Everything that was brought 
forth, created, formed, and made, everything that God did, was for the sake of His holy 
people Israel. 

Israel was the first thing that arose in God's thought. That is why the sages commented 
about the verse In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth (Gen. 1:1), that "begin- 
ning" means Israel, since God's first thought was of Israel. 

After the souls of Israel had been created, God was required to create and maintain the 
universe, for this was the purpose for which He had brought the souls of Israel into being. 

God foresaw the pride and delight He would receive from Israel, and it was because of 
this that God created the world. God perceived that Abraham would some day be bom, 
and perform deeds of love and kindness. Thus God created a world of love out of His love 
for Abraham. Indeed, every detail of creation was brought into being because of some 
element of pride that God would have from His people. Even the sinners of Israel were 
included in God's pride. Thus every single Jew is a garment for the Divine Presence. 

The stars in the sky appear very small, but in heaven they are actually quite large. The 
same is true of Israel. In this world, Israel appears very small. But in the world on high, it 
is actually quite large. 

When God created the world, it did not have the power to endure. God created Israel 
so that the world would be able to endure, for Israel is the sustenance of all universes. If 
not for Israel, everything would revert to its original state of nothingness. 

This myth expands on the notion of Israel as God's Chosen People by stating that 
"Israel was the first thing that arose in God's thought" and that "The world was cre- 
ated only for the sake of Israel." The Maggid of Mezrich compares the relationship of 
God and Israel to that of a father and his child — it is a relationship of love, pride, and 
delight: "When a father loves his child, this great love causes the child's image to be 
engraved on the father's mind. It is known that Israel rose first in God's thought. This 
means that it is constantly engraved in the Supernal thought, just as a child is in his 
father's mind." 

Here Israel is described as the First Created Being. There are several other divine 
beings who are described in these terms, among them the Heavenly Man, Adam, Adam 
Kadmon, and the Shekhinah. In this case, however, it is not an individual divine being 
who is identified as the First Created Being, but a nation, a people, whose destiny is 
interwoven with that of their God.

421. THE SOULS OF ISRAEL 

Some say that all souls come from Adam's soul. But others say that Abraham was the 
source of the souls of Israel, as it is said, And the souls that they had acquired (Gen. 12:5). 
After God had created them, these souls were preserved on high, and before the time of 
Abraham they had never descended to this world.

328 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


After the souls of Israel had emanated from God and had been brought into being, the 
future existence of this world was reaffirmed. For the universe and everything in it was 
created only for the sake of Israel. 

This myth reflects the point of view that history really begins with the story of 
Abraham, the first Jew, and suggests that the people of Israel were a separate creation, 
for God had saved the souls of Israel until that time. Thus these souls are untainted by 
the events recounted in Genesis that took place before Abraham— the Fall of Adam 
and Eve, Cain's murder of Abel, the generation of the Flood and the generation of the 
Tower of Babel. See "Adam's Soul," p. 162. 

A parallel idea is found in the myth of the Innocent Souls— souls that hid in the 
Garden of Eden at the time that Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, and thus were 
not tainted by their sin. The soul of the Ba'al Shem Tov was said to be one of these 
Innocent Souls.

422. THE BODY OF ISRAEL 

All of Israel is one body and everyone of Israel is a limb of that body. That is why, when 
one s fellow has sinned, it is as though one has sinned oneself. All of Israel is described as 
being attached to the Tree of Life. All of Israel heard God speak at Mount Sinai and all of 
Israel was said to have sung as one when it sang the Song at the Sea. All of Israel is 
responsible for the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem. And all of Israel must partici- 
pate in raising up the Shekhimh from Her exile. 

Here Israel is viewed as more than a nation or a people, but as one body, since, in the 
eyes of God, Israel, His people, is rewarded and punished as if they were one. Note 
the parallel of this concept to the Christian doctrine of Corpus Domini, where each 
member of the church is a member of the body of God. This is a key concept that is 
also found in other sources. In the myth of the Ari, the combined efforts of all of Israel 
are required in order to gather the holy sparks that had been scattered around the 
world, so that the messianic era may be initiated. See "God's Image," p. 33; "The Fruit 
of the Tree of Life," p. 402; "The Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the 
Sparks," p. 122; and "The Shekhimh Within," p. 63.

423. THE LESSON OF THE STARS 

When Abraham was still a boy, he saw the sun shining upon the earth, and he thought that 
surely the sun must be God, and therefore he would serve it. So he served the sun all that day, 
and prayed to it. But when evening came and the sun set, Abraham said to himself, surely 
this cannot be God. And Abraham wondered who had made the heavens and the earth. 

That night, when Abraham lifted his eyes to the sky, he saw the stars and moon before 
him, and he thought that the moon must have created the world, and the stars were its 
servants. And Abraham served the moon and prayed to it all night. 



MYTHS OF ABRAHAM 329 


But in the morning, when the sun shone upon the earth again, and the moon and stars 
could not be seen, Abraham understood that they were not gods, but that they were the 
servants of God. And from that day on Abraham knew the Lord and went in the ways of 
the Lord until the day of his death. 

This is an important midrash, in that it offers an explanation of how Abraham 
discovered the existence of God, and therefore it provides the origin of monotheism. 

It grows out of a problem in the biblical story of Abraham. When Abraham is first 
encountered, he is already a grown man and God tells him to leave the land he was 
bom in and go to the land that God will reveal to him. Notably missing from this 
narrative is any indication of the childhood of Abraham, or how Abraham discovered 
God. This midrash supplies an answer to both of these problems, recounting Abraham's 
childhood and showing, at the same time, how the child Abraham used logic to deter- 
mine that there must be a God who ruled over the sun and moon and everything else. 

There are many other midrashim about Abraham's birth and childhood, primarily 
modeled on the childhood of Moses.

424. GOD CALLS UPON ABRAM 

The Lord said to Abram, "Go forth from your native land and from your father's house to 
the land that I will show you. I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you; I will 
make your name great, and you shall be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you and 
curse him that curses you; and all the families of the earth shall bless themselves by you." 

Abram went forth as the Lord had commanded him, and Lot went with him. Abram 
was seventy-five years old when he left the city of Haran. Abram took his wife Sarai and 
his brother's son Lot, and all the wealth that they had amassed, and the persons that they 
had acquired in Haran; and they set out for the land of Canaan. 

This is the beginning of the Abraham narrative in Genesis that starts with the fa- 
mous words, Lekh Lekha, "Go forth." No explanation is given about how Abraham 
(originally named "Abram," as Sarah was originally "Sarai") discovered God or God 
discovered Abraham and when we first meet him, Abraham is a grown man. But be- 
cause of his great faith, Abraham uproots himself and leaves Haran and sets out on a 
journey to the Holy Land. All of Abraham's actions are consistent with this one — 
more than any other individual, Abraham exhibits perfect faith in God, even when 
God asks him to sacrifice his beloved son, Isaac.

425. GOD'S COVENANT WITH ABRAM 

And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot had parted from him, "Raise your eyes and look 
out from where you are, to the north and south, to the east and west, for I give all the land 
that you see to you and your offspring forever. I will make your offspring as the dust of 
the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, then your offspring too can be 
counted. Up, walk about the land, through its length and its breadth, for I give it to you. 
And Abram moved his tent, and came to dwell at the terebinths of Mamre, which are in 
Hebron; and he built an altar there to the Lord. 



330 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


This is one of the most famous of the covenants God makes with Abraham (then 
known as Abram), along with Genesis 15:1-5 where God says, "Look toward heaven and 
count the stars, if you are able to count them.” And He added, “So shall your offspring be." 
For centuries, God's statement that “I give all the land that you see to you and your off- 
spring forever" has been the basis of the claim that Jews have the right to all of the 
traditional Land of Israel. Most recently, Israeli settlers have asserted this claim, which 
many regard as the root issue of the Arab-Israeli conflict. For these settlers, this and 
similar biblical passages serve as a kind of deed, proving their ownership of the land.

Genesis 13:14-18. 


426. GOD APPEARS TO ABRAHAM 

The Lord appeared to Abraham by the terebinths of Mamre; he was sitting at the en- 
trance of the tent as the day grew hot. Looking up, he saw three men standing near him. 
As soon as he saw them, he ran from the entrance of the tent to greet them and, bowing 
to the ground, he said, "My lords, if it please you, do not go on past your servant. Let a 
little water be brought; bathe your feet and recline under the tree. And let me fetch a 
morsel of bread that you may refresh yourselves; then go on— seeing that you have come 
your servant's way." They replied, "Do as you have said." 

Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, "Quick, three seahs of choice flour! 
Knead and make cakes!" Then Abraham ran to the herd, took a calf, tender and choice, 
and gave it to a servant-boy, who hastened to prepare it. He took curds and milk and the 
calf that had been prepared and set these before them; and he waited on them under the 
tree as they ate. 

They said to him, "Where is your wife Sarah?" And he replied, "There, in the tent." 
Then one said, "I will return to you next year, and your wife Sarah shall have a son!" 
Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent, which was behind him. Now Abraham 
and Sarah were old, advanced in years; Sarah had stopped having the periods of women. 
And Sarah laughed to herself, saying, "Now that I am withered, am I to have enjoy- 
ment— with my husband so old?" Then the Lord said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, 
saying, 'Shall I in truth bear a child, old as I am?' Is anything too wondrous for the Lord? 
I will return to you at the time next year, and Sarah shall have a son." Sarah lied, saying, 
"I did not laugh," for she was frightened. But He replied, "You did laugh." 

The visit of the three angels to Abraham is one of the most important episodes in the 
Bible. It is here that Abraham demonstrates his great hospitality to the three visitors, 
and it is here that the promise that Sarah would give birth is made, despite the fact that 
both Abraham and Sarah were quite old. Sarah is so skeptical of this prophecy that she 
laughs, and her laugh is immortalized in Isaac's name, which means "to laugh." This, 
then, is a crucial stage in fulfilling God's promise to Abraham that his offspring would 
be like the sands of the shore and the stars of the sky, and this promise is fulfilled in a 
miraculous form, by having the couple become parents in their old age. 

Note that while the men who arrive at Abraham's tent are identified as angels, it is 
God who says, "Wliy did Sarah laugh?" This indicates that two versions of this episode 
have been combined together, one in which Abraham's guests were angels and an- 
other in which God Himself comes to visit him, accompanied by two angels — the two 
angels who then set out for Sodom, to inform Lot, Abraham's nephew, that the city 
was about to be destroyed.

MYTHS OF ABRAHAM 331 


427. ABRAHAM'S VISION OF GOD 

On the third day after Abraham circumcised himself, the Lord appeared to him (Gen. 18:1) 
as he sat in the door of his tent. As God spoke to him, Abraham was transformed, and 
became a full-fledged prophet. After that, the Shekhinah spoke from his throat, and God's 
presence remained with him. So too did God show Abraham each generation and its 
leaders, as He had shown Adam. 

Prior to his circumcision, Abraham's prophetic experience was purely visionary, but 
now the voice of prophecy issued forth from his lips, and he enjoyed a measure of the Holy 
Spirit, for the Voice of God was revealed in his speech. After this Abraham did not only 
receive messages from God, but he was able to initiate communication with God as well. 

As a result of the circumcision, Abraham had become an even holier person, capable 
of receiving a visit from God while remaining seated and fully awake, even during the 
hottest time of the day So too was he able to absorb a vision of God in His superior light. 
For not all visions are of the same caliber — this vision was of a superior nature compared 
to the previous ones. For once Abraham was circumcised, he attained the fullest possible 
prophetic vision. 

Then, just as God had shown Adam each generation and its leaders. He also showed 
each generation and its leaders to Abraham, as well as each generation and its sages. 

Some say that God manifested Himself to Abraham that day by means of a tree, since 
the vision took place at the terebinths of Mamre. Why did God choose a tree to be the site 
at which He manifested Himself? To show Abraham that, like an old tree, he could still 
bear fruit. 

God's appearance to Abraham in Genesis 18:1 is the subject of much debate by 
commentators, since the matter spoken of is not mentioned. Rashi assumes that three 
days after his adult circumcision, God came to inquire about Abraham's well-being. 

On the one hand, the Zohar views this appearance as a mystical experience, which 
profoundly transforms Abraham into a prophet. On the other hand, Rashi views God 
as making a sick call. 

The role of God in this passage is further complicated by the fact that the same 
figure is sometimes identified as an angel and sometimes as God. Possibly two vari- 
ants of the myth were combined, without resolving their inherent contradictions. 

The notion that God appeared to Abraham as a tree takes the interpretation in 
another direction. This is deduced from the reference to the terebinths of Mamre. There 
are some natural links between the two: one famous passage, associated with the To- 
rah, states that she is a tree of life to those who grasp her (Prov. 3:18). God is so closely 
linked to the Torah, which is His creation, that any identification of the Torah with a 
tree might, at the same time, apply to God. It is also important to recall that the 
Canaanite goddess Asherah was linked to sacred groves, and therefore identified with 
a tree. A womblike shape was carved into the base of these trees. 

One question the rabbis wrestled with was whether Abraham circumcised himself, 
or if someone else did it. The question arises because of the great difficulty of any man 
circumcising himself. Although Genesis 17:24 seems to indicate clearly that Abraham 
did this himself. Rabbi Levi in Genesis Rahbah 47:9 asserts "It is not written here that 
Abraham circumcised himself, but rather that he was circumcised by God." Zohar 
1:96b describes a miraculous circumcision when Abram threw himself upon his face ; and 
God spoke with him further, “As for Me, this is My covenant with you " (Gen. 17:3-4). And 
when Abraham arose, he found himself already circumcised.

428. ABRAHAM'S GLOWING STONE 

Abraham wore a glowing stone around his neck. Some say that it was a pearl, others that 
it was a jewel. The light emitted by that jewel was like the light of the sun, illuminating 
the entire world. Abraham used that stone as an astrolabe to study the motion of the 
stars, and with its help he became a master astrologer. For his power of reading the stars, 
Abraham was much sought after by the potentates of East and West. So too did that 
glowing precious stone bring immediate healing to any sick person who looked into it. 

At the moment when Abraham took leave of this world, the precious stone raised 
itself and flew up to heaven. God took it and hung it on the wheel of the sun. 

This talmudic legend about a glowing stone that Abraham wore around his neck is 
a part of the chain of legends about that glowing jewel, known as the Tzohar, which 
was first given to Adam and Eve when they were expelled from the Garden of Eden 
and also came into the possession of Noah, who hung it in the ark. See "The Tzohar, p. 

85. This version of the legend adds the detail that the glowing stone was also an astro- 
labe, with which Abraham could study the stars.

429. ABRAHAM IN EGYPT 

There was a famine in the land, and Abraham and his wife Sarah went down into Egypt. 
First they went South until they reached Hebron, but since the famine was there as well, 
they made their way to Egypt, where there were said to be sufficient fruits and veg- 
etables. Eventually they reached one of the seven branches of the Nile, and the night they 
entered Egypt, Abraham dreamed a dream. 

In the dream he saw a cedar and a palm that grew side by side. For many years they 
flourished together, but then men came who wanted to cut down the cedar, leaving the 
palm there alone. But the palm tree spoke to them, saying "Do not cut down the cedar, 
for we are two of a kind." And they were so astonished to hear these words from a tree, 
that the cedar was spared for the sake of the palm. 

When Abraham awoke he was greatly afraid, for he knew that the dream must be a 
sign that his life was in danger. For surely he was the cedar and Sarah was the palm. He 
told Sarah his dream, and she too recognized its meaning. For Sarah was a great proph- 
etess and interpreter of dreams. Sarah told Abraham that while the dream did signify 
that his life was in danger, it also indicated that he would be saved in the end, and some- 
how she would cause him to be saved. 

This prophecy came to pass when Pharaoh saw Sarah's beauty, and sought to kill 
Abraham, believing him to be her husband. Then Sarah assured Pharaoh that he was 
only her kinsman and Pharaoh agreed to spare his life. Thus did Sarah save Abraham, 
just as the cedar was saved by the palm. 

This myth from Genesis Apocryphon, one of the Dead Sea Scrolls, serves to explain 
and justify Abraham's behavior in Genesis 12:10-20, when he identified Sarah as his 
sister rather than his wife. The use of dreams to convey a prophecy or a divine mes- 
sage is common, with the dreams of Joseph serving as the primary model. Note that 
this myth includes both the dream and the interpretation, as do the dreams of Joseph. 

The notion that Sarah was a great prophetess is widely found. In B. Sota 29a, it is 
stated that Sarah was the only woman to whom God ever spoke directly. 



MYTHS OF ABRAHAM 333 


The theme of Sarah's beauty is expanded on in Genesis Rabbah 40:5 and in Targum 
Yonathan on Genesis 12:11. Here Sarah was said to have been so beautiful that the 
entire land of Egypt was irradiated with her beauty, for she was even more beautiful 
than Eve. 

Sources: 

Genesis Apocryphon. 


430. ABRAHAM'S NAME 

When Abraham was still known as Abram, he was a skilled astrologer, and he saw in the 
stars that neither he nor Sarah would beget a child. All the other astrologers confirmed 
that this was true. When God told Abraham that I will make you exceedingly fertile (Gen. 
17:6), Abraham said, "I have read in the stars that it is not possible that I should beget." 

God replied, "What did the stars say to you? That Abram and Sarai will not beget? 
And you shall no longer be called Abram , but your name shall be Abraham (Gen. 17:5), and as for 
your wife Sarai , you shall not call her Sarai , but her name shall be Sarah (Gen. 17:15). For while 
Abram and Sarai will not beget, Abraham and Sarah will be fruitful." 

When God changed Abraham's name, he added a new letter to his name, the letter 
heh. Where did that letter come from? God took it from beneath the Throne of Glory and 
gave it as a crown to the soul of Abraham. And Abraham received that crown when God 
said the words, " And you shall no longer be called Abram " (Gen. 17:5). After that Abraham 
was a new person, for his soul had been infused with the crown of that letter, and that 
letter brought with it the breath of life. 

And God said to Abraham: "Because of the letter that has been added to your name, 
the heavens will be in your control and all the stars and constellations that give forth 
light will be subjected to you." Ever since, anyone who studies the Torah nullifies the 
power of the constellations over himself, as long as he studies it in order to fulfill its 
commandments. But those who do not study the Torah remain subject to the influences 
of the stars and constellations. 

The tradition that Abraham was an astrologer was likely inspired by God's prom- 
ise to Abraham: "Look toward heaven and count the stars , if you are able to count them." 

And He added , "So shall your offspring be"(Ge n. 15:1-5). Abraham's role as an astrologer 
is also affirmed by the talmudic tradition that Abraham wore a glowing stone around 
his neck that he used as an astrolabe to study the stars. See "Abraham's Glowing 
Stone," p. 332. 

The letter that Abraham receives as a crown to his soul functions much like an 
ibbur, the spirit of a departed sage that fuses with the soul of a living person. Here God 
gives Abraham the letter heh, taken from beneath the Throne of Glory, and fuses it 
with his soul, not only changing his name, but also his soul. Thus the change in his 
soul is a gift from God, which transforms him into the Patriarch Abraham. 

Note the linkage of this myth to the nullification of the power of astrological forces 
over a person. This grows out of the tradition that when God gave the Torah to Israel, 

He removed control of the stars and constellations over them, since the Torah tran- 
scends the world. This demonstrates the rabbis' recognition of the widespread belief 
in astrological forces and their concern that people would put their faith in these forces 
rather than in the Torah.

431. ISCAH THE SEER 

Who was Iscah? Iscah was Sarah. And why was she called Iscah? Because she saw through 
the Holy Spirit. 

The difficult genealogy of Abraham and Sarah in Genesis 11:29 led to confusion as 
to the identity of Iscah. The resolution found in Targum Pseudo-Yonathan, the Talmud, 
and other rabbinic sources is that Sarah was Iscah, and that Iscah was a seer. This 
meaning is derived from the Aramaic root of Iscah, which denotes seeing. This led to 
the tradition that Sarah was a prophetess as great or greater than Abraham. The impli- 
cation is that Iscah is a kind of alter ego for Sarah, and that when she turned to her 
prophetic side, she became Iscah.

432. ABRAHAM BARGAINS WITH GOD 

Now the Lord had said. Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do, since Abraham 
is to become a great and populous nation and all the nations of the earth are to bless 
themselves by him? For I have singled him out, that he may instruct his children and his 
posterity to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is just and right, in order that the 
Lord may bring about for Abraham what He has promised him." Then the Lord said, 
"The outrage of Sodom and Gomorrah is so great, and their sin so grave! I will go down 
to see whether they have acted altogether according to the outcry that has reached Me; if 
not, I will take note." 

The men went on from there to Sodom, while Abraham remained standing before the 
Lord. Abraham came forward and said, "Will You sweep away the innocent along with 
the guilty? What if there should be fifty innocent within the city; will You then wipe out 
the place and not forgive it for the sake of the innocent fifty who are in it? Far be it from 
You to do such a thing, to bring death upon the innocent as well as the guilty, so that 
innocent and guilty fare alike. Far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal 
justly?" And the Lord answered, "If I find within the city of Sodom fifty innocent ones, I 
will forgive the whole place for their sake." Abraham spoke up, saying, "Here I venture 
to speak to my Lord, I who am but dust and ashes: What if the fifty innocent should lack 
five? Will You destroy the whole city for want of the five?" And He answered, "I will not 
destroy if I find forty-five there." But he spoke to Him again, and said, "What if forty 
should be found there?" And He answered, "I will not do it, for the sake of the forty." 
And he said, "Let not my Lord be angry if I go on: What if thirty should be found there?" 
And He answered, "I will not do it if I find thirty there." And he said, "I venture again to 
speak to my Lord: What if twenty should be found there?" And He answered, "I will not 
destroy, for the sake of the twenty." And he said, "Let not my Lord be angry if I speak but 
this last time: What if ten should be found there?" And He answered, "I will not destroy, 
for the sake of the ten." 

When the Lord had finished speaking to Abraham, He departed; and Abraham re- 
turned to his place. 

Bargaining is built into the fabric of the Near East, and here Abraham bargains 
with God over how many righteous people were needed to be living in Sodom and 



MYTHS OF ABRAHAM 335 


Gomorrah for God to spare the city. Abraham starts with 50 and bargains God down 
to ten. That God is willing to bargain with Abraham shows how important Abraham 
is to God, and goes a long way in the personification process that portrays God with 
humanlike qualities. 

Biblical commentators often note that Abraham does not make the same effort to 
change God's mind when God commands him to take his son Isaac and sacrifice him 
in Genesis 22. It does seem strange that Abraham intervenes for the strangers of Sodom 
and Gomorrah and not for his own son. This demonstrates that the characteristics of 
biblical figures are not always consistent, nor is that of God.

433. THE SOULS OF CONVERTS 

Sarah was not barren. Although she had not given birth to a child, she had given birth to 
souls, as it is said. And the souls they had made in Horan (Gen. 12:5). 

This myth is a rather strange commentary on Genesis 16:1, Sarah was barren. She had 
no children. The commonly understood meaning of the souls they had made is that it 
refers to converts to the one God of Judaism. In this interpretation, Abraham and 
Sarah were successful in gathering converts to worship the one God. Rashi explains 
that the souls they had made means they found converts and "brought them under the 
wings of the Shekhinah." He explains that Abraham would convert the men and Sarah 
the women. This follows the literal meaning of the passage. The Zohar seeks an expla- 
nation for the repetition, since stating that Sarah was barren already indicates that she 
had no children. The second statement is thus explained in terms of Genesis 12:6, the 
souls they had made in Haran, suggesting that Sarah did give birth, but to souls, not to 
children. Thus Sarah is portrayed in the Zohar as a goddesslike figure who gives birth 
not to human children, but to souls. 

Zohar 1:79a explains that both Sarah and Abraham gave birth to the souls of con- 
verts while in Haran. Here the meaning of "made" is not quite as literal, as it is ex- 
plained that Abraham converted the men and Sarah converted the women. 

In Megaleh Amukot, Rabbi Nassan Nata Shapira agrees that both Abraham and Sa- 
rah gave birth to souls, and he identifies them as the souls of future converts. Accord- 
ing to Rabbi Shapira, Isaac also begat souls of future converts, as did Rachel. For all 
the years she was childless, she gave birth to souls in heaven. 

Strangest of all is the interpretation of Rabbi Tzadok ha-Kohen of Lublin, who in- 
terprets the souls that they had made as souls created from seed ejaculated during inter- 
course that did not conceive. He states that "These souls are the souls of converts, like 
the souls Abraham and Sarah created (Sihot Shedim 1 in Sifrei Rabbi Tzadok ha-Kohen ). 

Seed "wasted through masturbation," however, gives birth to evil spirits, demons, 
and liliyot, female demons of the night. 

Rabbi Shlomo Rabinowitz of Radomsk suggests an alternate origin for the souls of 
converts, linking them to Adam's sin: "When Adam sinned, many precious souls were 
captured by the Sitra Ahra. These are the souls of converts. Thus in converting, these 
souls returned to their true destiny." As to how Abraham and Sarah gave birth to 
these souls, Rabbi Rabinowitz quotes Rabbi Menahem Recanati, who said that when 
Tzaddikim discover new meaning of the Torah, they create souls in the higher world.

434. GOD BEGAT ISAAC 

One of the most sacred mysteries of the Torah concerns Isaac's true father. Although 
Abraham rejoiced when he learned that he was to become a father, the truth is that it was 
the Lord who begat Isaac. For the Lord visited Sarah and did to her as He had spoken, 
and she conceived. That is why God said, "I gave him Isaac" (Josh. 24:3) and formed him in 
the womb of her who gave birth to him." Nevertheless, Isaac resembled Abraham in 
every respect. 

It is said that Sarah was accustomed to bring forth children for God alone, restoring 
with gratitude the first fruit of all the blessings she had received, since she was a virgin 
when God opened her womb. For it does not say that Sarah did not give birth at all, only 
that she did not bring forth for Abraham, for she told him, "The Lord has kept me from 
bearing" (Gen. 16:2). 

So too is it said that Sarah herself was not bom of a human mother, but that she was 
bom of God, the Father and Cause of all things. Indeed, she transcended the entire world 
of bodily forms and exulted in the joy of God. 

Others say that Sarah s conception and the birth of Isaac took place on the same day, as 
it is said, Sarah conceived and bore a son (Gen. 21:2). For unlike others, the soul of Isaac was 
not conceived at one time and bom at another. A heavenly light appeared at his birth, as 
happened with Noah. 

So too was it God who named Isaac when He said, "But My covenant I will maintain with 
Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this season next year." (Gen. 17:21). For his name was 
ordained and written in the heavenly tablets. This was the only time that God named a 
child before he was bom. Isaac was conceived on Rosh ha-Shanah, the New Year, and his 
birth book place on the first day of Passover. On the day of Isaac's birth the sun shone with 
a splendor that had not been seen since the sin of Adam and Eve and will only be seen 
again in the World to Come. So too did all creation rejoice: the earth, the heavens, the sun, 
the moon, and the stars. For had Isaac not been bom, the world would have ceased to exist. 


Here Philo brings yet another perspective to the story of Isaac by revealing "one of 
the most sacred mysteries"— that it was God, not Abraham, who begat Isaac. Philo's 
belief in this strange interpretation of the conception of Isaac appears in at least six 
texts where Philo suggests that God was the true father of Isaac. Philo's interpretation 
perhaps influenced Christianity. Just as Jesus was said to be the son of God, so too is 
Isaac identified as a son of God. How does Philo arrive at this explanation? He inter- 
prets Sarah's comment that "God has caused me laughter" (Gen. 21:6) to mean that the 
Lord has begotten Isaac. He interprets "has caused" to mean "begotten," and he sub- 
stitutes Isaac for laughter, since ' Isaac" means "laughter," referring to Sarah's laugh- 
ter in Genesis 18:12, when the angel said that she would have a child even though 
Sarah was 90 years old. 

Philo apparently wrote a now-lost text on Isaac, entitled De Isaaco. Goodenough 
speculates that “De Isaaco developed as its central theme the fact that Isaac was so 
completely at one with the power behind the cosmos that he typified joy" (By Light, 
Light p. 154). 

The Christian parallel to this interpretation of Philo is obvious: God begat Isaac 
through Sarah just as God begat Jesus through Mary. Sarah herself is a kind of virgin 
in that she is childless. Did Philo mean to suggest a Jewish version of the myth of the 
birth of a Jewish savior? Not necessarily, in that Philo is quick to reduce the myth to 
allegory, by describing God as perfect in nature, sowing and begetting happiness in 
the soul. So too does Philo insist that Isaac was not bom a man, but as a pure thought. 
As a result, some readers might consider Philo's interpretation pure allegory, but Philo 
cannot escape the implications of his commentaries, making the mythic explanation 
of Isaac's birth unavoidable. 



MYTHS OF ISAAC 337 


In addition to the obvious Christian parallel, there are also parallels from Greek 
myth, where Zeus takes many mortals as lovers. 

There are other instances of supernatural conception found in Jewish tradition. 
The verse in which Eve says, "l have received a man from God " (Gen. 4:1) is interpreted 
to mean not that God fathered Cain, but that the serpent begat Cain. See "How Cain 
Was Conceived," p. 447. Also, there is the myth of the conception of Rabbi Ishmael, 
the High Priest, whose true father was said to be the angel Gabriel. See "How Rabbi 
Ishmael was Conceived," p. 201.

435. THE BINDING OF ISAAC 

Some time afterward, God put Abraham to the test. He said to him, "Abraham," and he 
answered, "Here I am." And He said, "Take your son, your favored one, Isaac, whom you 
love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the 
heights that I will point out to you." So early next morning, Abraham saddled his ass and 
took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. He split the wood for the burnt offer- 
ing, and he set out for the place of which God had told him. On the third day Abraham 
looked up and saw the place from afar. Then Abraham said to his servants, "You stay here 
with the ass. The boy and I will go up there; we will worship and we will return to you." 

Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and put it on his son Isaac. He himself 
took the firestone and the knife; and the two walked off together. Then Isaac said to his 
father Abraham, "Father!" And he answered, "Yes, my son." And he said, "Here are the 
firestone and the wood; but where is the sheep for the burnt offering?" And Abraham 
said, "God will see to the sheep for His burnt offering, my son." And the two of them 
walked on together. 

They arrived at the place of which God had told him. Abraham built an altar there; he 
laid out the wood; he bound his son Isaac; he laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. 
And Abraham picked up the knife to slay his son. Then an angel of the Lord called to him 
from heaven: "Abraham! Abraham!" And he answered, "Here I am." And he said, "Do 
not raise your hand against the boy, or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear 
God, since you have not withheld your son, your favored one, from Me." When Abraham 
looked up, his eye fell upon a ram, caught in the thicket by its horns. So Abraham went 
and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering in place of his son. And Abraham 
named that site Adonai-yireh, whence the present saying, "On the mount of the Lord 
there is vision." 

The angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven, and said, "By 
Myself I swear, the Lord declares: Because you have done this and have not withheld your 
son, your favored one, I will bestow My blessing upon you and make your descendants as 



338 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


numerous as the stars of heaven and the sands on the seashore; and your descendants shall 
seize the gates of their foes. All the nations of the earth shall bless themselves by your 
descendants, because you have obeyed My command." Abraham then returned to his ser- 
vants, and they departed together for Beersheva; and Abraham stayed in Beersheva. 

The Binding of Isaac (Akedat Yitzhak) is one of the central episodes of the Bible. It is 
the subject of great debate and many midrashic versions exist. The most perplexing 
aspects of this narrative are God's command that Abraham sacrifice Isaac and Abraham's 
almost robotic willingness to fulfill it. Considerable tension exists between God's prom- 
ise to Abraham that his descendants will be like the stars of the sky, and God's insis- 
tence that Abraham sacrifice the son through whom he expects that promise can be 
fulfilled (Gen. 17:19). 

This biblical episode is especially difficult to explain to children, for it is impos- 
sible to justify a parent's sacrifice of his or her child. When stripped of its biblical 
quaintness, it is a terrible story, and similar ones about a parent murdering a child 
provoke nothing but horror. The biblical account is generally viewed as a divine test 
of faith, which Abraham passes, as Job does. Adam and Eve, who are subjected to 
another such divine test, fail it and are expelled from the Garden of Eden. 

One possibility is that this episode was originally a kind of boilerplate narrative, 
perhaps not Israelite in origin, about a human sacrifice to a god. The editors of Gen- 
esis, then, took this sacrifice narrative, inserted Abraham and Isaac, and instead of 
having the man slay his son, had an angel of the Lord stop him at the last moment, 
with an animal— the ram in the thicket— sacrificed in Isaac's place. The precedent set 
is clear: from this time on there shall be no more human sacrifices, but they shall be 
replaced by animal sacrifices. This remained the precedent until the destruction of the 
Temple in Jerusalem, after which even animal sacrifices were eliminated, since there 
was no remaining altar on which to perform the sacrifice.

436. HOW ABRAHAM RECOGNIZED MOUNT MORIAH 

God told Abraham, " Take your son, your favored one, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land 
of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the heights that I will point out to you" 
(Gen. 22:2). Abraham did find that mountain, as it is said. On the third day Abraham looked 
up and saw the place from afar (Gen. 22:4). But how did Abraham recognize Mount Moriah? 

Some say that Abraham saw a cloud enveloping the mountain and knew that was the 
place where God wanted him to sacrifice his son. Abraham asked Isaac if he saw anything, 
and Isaac pointed to the cloud hovering above the mountain. But neither of the two young 
men who accompanied Abraham and Isaac to Mount Moriah saw anything at all. 

Others say that Abraham said to God, "Master of the Universe, upon which moun- 
tain?" God replied, "You will see My glory waiting for you. That is how you will recog- 
nize the altar." So it was that Abraham saw the place from afar. There he saw the glory of the 
Shekhinah standing on top of the mountain in the form of a pillar of fire reaching from 
earth to heaven. He asked Isaac if he saw anything and Isaac said, "Yes, I see a pillar of 
fire reaching into heaven. When Isaac said this, Abraham knew that his son was accept- 
able as a burnt-offering. 



MYTHS OF ISAAC 339 


Still others say that there was a light shining and a cloud clinging to the top of that 
mountain, and Abraham knew that was the Shekhinah and the place of the sacrifice. 

Then there are those who say that when Abraham approached the mountain, the fin- 
ger of God pointed it out to him. 

Genesis 22:4 recounts that Abraham looked up, and saw the place from afar. However, 
just how Abraham was able to recognize Mount Moriah is not explained, thereby 
opening it to midrashic interpretation. The two primary explanations are that Abraham 
saw a cloud, or else he saw the Shekhinah — God's Presence — above the mountain, which 
took the form of a pillar of fire. This pillar recalls, of course, the pillar of cloud and the 
pillar of fire that led the Israelites in the wilderness. This interpretation derives from 
the word ha-Makom, meaning "the place," which is also understood to be one of the 
names of God. Thus in seeing "the place," Abraham saw God. Here the term Shekhinah 
carries its midrashic, pre-kabbalistic meaning, referring to God's presence rather than 
God's Bride.

437. THE SACRIFICE 

Abraham and Sarah lived in the Land of Israel and their lives were good, but they didn't 
have any children. One day Abraham prayed to God and said, "If You give me a son. I'll 
give him to You as a sacrifice." 

At the age of one hundred, Abraham had a son and he named him Isaac. The boy grew 
and Abraham forgot his promise to God. After several years God came to Abraham in a 
dream and said, "Abraham, you promised that you would give Me your son as a sacrifice." 

In the morning, when Abraham awoke, he remembered the dream, and he said to 
Sarah, "I am going to take my son to study. Don't worry about him. He will be with me." 

Abraham took Isaac and went to the forest. They were both silent. But when they 
arrived, Isaac said, "Father, why did you bring me here?" Abraham said, "My son, before 
you were born I had to make a vow that if I had a son, I would sacrifice him to God." 
Isaac said, "Father, I am ready." So Abraham tied the hands of Isaac behind his back and 
laid him on the wood, and he took the knife in his hand and put it on Isaac's neck. At that 
instant Abraham heard the voice of God: "Abraham, Abraham, leave the child. I have 
already received the sacrifice you wanted to give Me. Look, there is a sheep. Sacrifice it to 
Me instead of your son." 

So Abraham untied his son, caught the sheep, and sacrificed it to God. 

The oral retelling of the binding of Isaac from India makes some crucial changes 
from the biblical account. The most crucial is that in the oral version Abraham and 
God reach a bargain whereby God will give him a son, and Abraham will sacrifice the 
son to God. This is very different than the sudden demand by God in Genesis 22 that 
Abraham sacrifice Isaac. Nevertheless, this oral version ends as does the biblical one, 
with God stopping the sacrifice at the last minute, and an animal being sacrificed 
instead of Isaac. It is possible that this oral retelling of Genesis 22 may be closer to the 
original oral version of the myth than that found in the Bible, as it follows a folk 
pattern in which a parent desperate for a child vows to give that child to the god who 



340 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


provides it. See, for example, the story of the birth of Samuel in 1 Samuel 1:1-28. Also, 
Hannah makes a similar bargain with the Jewish God in 1 Samuel 1:11. Another example, 
closer to the spirit of the present tale, is "The Black Hand" in Lilith's Cave, pp. 197-198.

438. SATAN AT MOUNT MORIAH 

While Abraham and Isaac were traveling on the road to Mount Moriah, Satan appeared 
to Abraham in the guise of an old man and asked him where he was going. Abraham 
answered. To pray." The old man asked, "Why then are you carrying wood, fire, and a 
knife?" Abraham answered, "We may spend a day or two there, and we will kill an ani- 
mal, cook and eat it." 

Old man, said Satan, "are you out of your mind? You are going to slay a son given to 
you at the age of one hundred! And tomorrow, when you do, He will tell you that you are 
a murderer, guilty of shedding your son's blood." Abraham said, "Still, I would obey 
Him." And Abraham turned away from Satan. 

Seeing that he could not sway Abraham, Satan appeared to Isaac in the guise of a young 
man and said, "Rim now for your life. Your old father has lost his mind, and he is planning 
to sacrifice you. All those fine things your mother prepared for you are to be the inheritance 
of Ishmael." But Isaac refused to pay heed to him and continued to travel with his father. 

When Satan saw that Abraham and Isaac had spumed him, he turned himself into a 
great river lying across their path. Abraham strode into the water, which reached his 
knees. Follow me, he said. By the time they reached midstream, the water was up to 
their necks. At that moment Abraham called out to God, and God rebuked Satan, the 
river dried up, and they stood on dry land. 

This midrash makes the underlying assumption that God and Satan have made a 
wager concerning Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac, much as they made a wa- 
ger in the prologue to Job. God believes that Abraham will follow through on what- 
ever He commands him to do, including the sacrifice of Isaac. Satan seeks to stop 
Abraham from going through with the Akedah, the binding of Isaac. First Satan takes 
the form of an old man, then a young man, then a river blocking their path. But all 
three attempts fail. 

One way of looking at this midrash is that it permits the rabbis to express through 
the mouth of Satan their doubts about God's command to Abraham. What Satan says 
to Abraham and Isaac makes good sense, and reflects rabbinic incredulity at God's 
command to Abraham to sacrifice Isaac. Since these doubts cannot be expressed di- 
rectly, they are expressed indirectly by putting them in the mouth of Satan. 

These kinds of doubts are also found in some other midrashim, such as the blunt 
exchanges between Abraham and Isaac recounted in Ner ha-Hayim and Yalkut Shim’oni 
1:101: "Isaac said to Abraham, 'My father, what are you doing with me?' Abraham 
answered, 'I am going to carry out your Maker's will.' Isaac said, 'What will you say 
to my poor old mother?' He answered, 'I will tell her that Isaac has been slaughtered.' 

You will kill her and be guilty of her death,' said Isaac. 'Instead, when you have burnt 
me, take my ashes to my mother, perhaps she would find consolation in them.' 'So it 
will be,' said Abraham."

MYTHS OF ISAAC 341 


439. ISAAC SEES THE SHEKHINAH 

Isaac asked his father, "Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt- 
offering?" Abraham answered, "You are the lamb for the burnt-offering." 

When Isaac was bound upon the fire, he saw the heavens open, and he saw the Shekhinah 
above him in heaven, ready to receive him. Then Isaac broke forth into song. What song 
did he sing? The song of sacrifice. 

Here Isaac is willing to let himself be sacrificed, and when he is bound on the altar 
he has a vision of the Shekhinah and breaks into song. This grows out of the tradition 
that when the righteous see the Shekhinah, they break straightway into song. 

For other versions of Isaac's heavenly vision, see "Isaac's Ascent," p. 171.

Sefer ha-Pardes; Midrash ha-Gadol, Bereshit 22:3. 


440. GOD BINDS THE PRINCES OF THE HEATHENS 

Even as Abraham bound his son Isaac below, so did God bind the princes of the heathens 
above and make them subservient to Israel. Yet they did not remain so bound, for Israel 
alienated themselves from God. God said, "Do you think that those fetters are forever? 
When Israel breaks its covenant with Me, their fetters are broken." 

Here God immediately rewards Israel when Abraham binds Isaac to the altar by 
binding the princes of the heathens — the angels who served as guardians to the hea- 
then nations — thus making them subservient to Israel. But this fettering only lasts 
while Israel upholds its part of the covenant with God. When Israel fails to do so, God 
unfetters the princes, and the heathen nations take their revenge on Israel. 

Perhaps the most interesting thing about this myth is the parallelism between earth 
and heaven: just as Abraham binds his son, God binds the princes of the heathens. 

Other parallels between above and below are often found in the midrashic and 
kabbalistic texts, such as the parallels between the heavenly and earthly Jerusalem. 

Sources: 

Genesis Rabbah 56:5. 


441. THE ANGEL WHO SAVED ISAAC 

When Isaac was bound upon the altar, and Abraham's arm was upraised, with the knife 
in his hand, God called upon the Angel of the Lord and said, "Tell him not to lay his hand 
on the lad, nor to do anything to him." And the angel called to him from heaven, saying, 
"Abraham, Abraham, lay not your hand upon the lad." Abraham was terrified when he 
heard the voice, and he put down the blade. Thus was Isaac spared and a ram that was 
caught in the thorns sacrificed in his place. 

The Akedah, or binding of Isaac, was the subject of extensive midrashic revision. 

While this retelling of Genesis 22:10-12 does not stray far from the biblical text, it 
changes the perspective from Mount Moriah, where Abraham is about to sacrifice 
Isaac, to heaven, where God calls upon an angel to stop Abraham from slaying Isaac. 

In The Book of Jubilees, this change in perspective is even more striking because it is the 
angel himself who tells the story, speaking in the first person. This is an excellent 



342 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


example of the midrashic method, where details missing in the biblical text— specifi- 
cally, God ordering the Angel of the Lord to stop Abraham— are inserted to resolve 
any problems in the text. For another midrashic version of the Akedah, see "Isaac's 
Ascent," p. 171. 

Sources 

The Book of Jubilees 18:8-12. 


442. ISAAC'S VISION AT MOUNT MORIAH 

When Abraham bound Isaac at Mount Moriah, Isaac's eyes gazed at the heavenly angels. 
Thus Isaac saw the angels present there, but Abraham did not. As soon as the sword 
touched his neck, Isaac's soul departed. But when the voice of the angel rang out, "Do not 
raise your hand against the boy" (Gen. 22:12), his soul returned to his body. Abraham loos- 
ened his bonds, and Isaac stood on his feet. Then Isaac knew that there is a resurrection of 
the dead, and he said, "Blessed are You, O God, who resurrects the dead." 

When Rebecca first saw Isaac, he was wrapped in a tallit, and his appearance was like 
an angel of God. Later, Isaac returned to Mount Moriah, and through his prayer he changed 
God's decree that his wife be barren for twenty-two years. For when Isaac entreated the 
Lord for his wife, Rebecca conceived. 

After Abraham died, God appeared to Isaac and blessed him. Nor did God appear to 
Isaac with the Merkavah, the Divine Chariot, but instead the Shekhinah rested directly 
upon him. So too did God give Isaac a taste of the World to Come while he was still in this 
world, and as a result the Evil Inclination had no power over him. 

Some of the most remarkable traditions concern Isaac. Very little is said about Isaac 
in the Torah. He is first encountered as a child (although later rabbinic tradition in Seder 
Olam Rabbah 1 and elsewhere claims he was 37 at the time of the Akedah ), and later, as an 
old, blind man on his deathbed, so little of his life between youth and old age is known. 

This very absence of narrative produces some strange traditions, such as that which 
asserts that Isaac was slain by Abraham at Mount Moriah and his soul ascended into 
Paradise for three years before he was reborn. See "The Ascent of Isaac," p. 171. This 
myth, which runs counter to the central thrust of the Akedah narrative, that Abraham 
did not sacrifice Isaac, seems to have strong Christian echoes, especially in the use of the 
number three, specifically the three days after his death when Jesus was said to be res- 
urrected. From a Christian perspective, the binding of Isaac was identified as prefigur- 
ing the passion of Jesus. The verse God Himself will provide the sacrifice, my son (Gen. 

22:8) is understood in Christianity to mean that God will provide Himself— the Chris- 
tian notion that Jesus and God are one, and that in sacrificing Jesus, God was sacrificing 
Himself.

443. SARAH'S TENT 

While Sarah was alive, the cloud of the Shekhinah hovered at the entrance of her tent, the 
doors of the tent were wide open, her dough was blessed, and a light burned in her tent 



MYTHS OF ISAAC 343 


from one Sabbath eve to the next. When Sarah died, these all ceased. But although she 
had died, Sarah's likeness did not leave her tent. Yet no one saw her except for her son 
Isaac, for Abraham did not enter that room of the tent. 

When Isaac brought Rebecca to the tent of Sarah, the light that had gone out at the 
time of Sarah's death immediately shone again. 

This myth emphasizes the holiness of Sarah, since the cloud of the Shekhinah hov- 
ered at her tent. After Sarah died, this cloud disappeared, along with a light that burned 
all week. Nevertheless, Sarah's presence — like a ghost — remained, although only her 
son, Isaac, could see it. This seems like a mythic expression of a quite human experi- 
ence, sensing the presence of one's parents in their house long after they are gone. 

When Isaac married Rebecca, the light returned to the tent, meaning that Rebecca, like 
Sarah, was a holy person. Note, however, that there is no mention of the cloud of the 
Shekhinah returning, or that Rebecca's dough was blessed. Thus Rebecca was holy, but 
not to the extent of Sarah. This last detail about the dough seems to confirm the adage 
that as far as a man is concerned, no one can cook as well as his mother.

444. THE DEATH OF SARAH 

Some say that Satan came to Sarah when Abraham and Isaac were on Mount Moriah, and 
showed her a vision of Abraham with his knife raised above Isaac. And when Sarah saw 
that terrible vision, she cried out and was choked and died of anguish. 

Others say that Satan came to Sarah in the guise of Isaac. When she asked what his 
father had done to him, Isaac told her that Abraham had taken him to the summit of a 
high mountain, built an altar, and laid out the firewood. He had bound Isaac on top of the 
altar, and took the knife to slaughter him. And if God had not told him, "Do not raise your 
hand against the boy" (Gen 22:12), he would already have been slaughtered. And even 
before Satan, disguised as Isaac, finished speaking, Sarah's soul departed. 

Sarah's death is recounted at the beginning of Genesis 23. There is no direct refer- 
ence to the binding of Isaac in Genesis 22, but one of the rabbinic methods of interpre- 
tation was to assume that chapters next to each other were somehow related. Since no 
reason is given for Sarah's death in Genesis 23, it was understood to be related to the 
binding of Isaac. There is no mention in Genesis 22 that Abraham informed Sarah of 
his plans to sacrifice their son, and the shock of learning this might in itself be enough 
to kill her. Here Satan is held responsible for revealing Abraham's plans to Sarah, by 
showing her a terrible vision of Isaac bound on the altar and Abraham about to plunge 
a knife into him. The alternate version suggests that after Isaac returned, he told his 
mother what had happened, and this caused her soul to depart. In both cases, it is the 
binding of Isaac that is held responsible for Sarah's death.

445. THE CAVE OF M ACHPELAH 

When the three angels, disguised as travelers, visited Abraham, he went outside to fetch 
a young goat to slaughter for them. But the kid ran away from him, and he had to chase 
it through the fields to the entrance of a cave that Abraham had never entered. 



344 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


The kid paused an instant and then disappeared inside the entrance and Abraham 
followed after it. At first the cave was low, so that Abraham had to bend down, but soon 
it opened into a beautiful chamber, illuminated by a mysterious light. There was a won- 
derful scent, like that of balsam. And there, in that chamber, Abraham found the bodies 
of Adam and Eve, lying on couches, with candles burning at their head and feet, and 
their bodies were perfectly preserved. Adam and Eve had chosen that cave as their place 
of burial, for it was the closest site to the Garden of Eden, and the scent that pervaded it 
was that of Eden itself, which drifted from the Garden into that cave. 

When Abraham emerged, he knew that he had stumbled on a very holy place, and he 
decided then and there to purchase the cave from Ephron the Hittite, as a burial site for 
himself and his family. So too did he spare the kid that led him there. And that is the Cave 
of Machpelah in the city of Hebron, where the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and 
their wives are buried, in the chamber next to that of Adam and Eve. 

After Abraham was buried there, Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening 
(Gen. 24:63). This was the very field that Abraham had purchased near the Cave of 
Machpelah. When Isaac entered it, he would see the Shekhinah resting there and smell the 
heavenly fragrances that wafted from it. That is why he prayed there, and it was desig- 
nated as a place of prayer. 

This is an important legend that solves two problems. First, it provides a burial site 
for Adam and Eve, which is not found in Genesis. The wonderful scent is assumed to 
come from the Garden of Eden, and therefore it is understood that Adam and Eve 
chose to be buried as close to the garden as possible. Secondly, this legend explains 
why Abraham chose to buy the Cave of Machpelah from Ephron in Genesis 23:7-16, 
for Abraham already knew since the time of visit of the three angels in Genesis 18 that 
the cave was a holy place. This is one of the few sources that locates the Garden of 
Eden in the Holy Land. 

Of course, those creating this legend were already familiar with the tradition that 
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives, Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah, were buried in 
that cave in Hebron. (Rachel has a separate grave.) By adding Adam and Eve to those 
already believed to be buried there, the cave was made even holier, and all of the key 
fathers and mothers were understood to be buried in the same place. 

Another myth links Adam and Eve to a cave that came to serve as their burial 
place. See Apocalypse of Moses 29:3-6, where Adam begs to take incense from the Gar- 
den of Eden with him when he is expelled. Adam is said to have hidden that incense 
in a cave. Indeed, this myth is a close variant of the present myth, where Abraham 
finds Adam and Eve lying on couches, with candles burning at their head and feet, in 
the Cave of Machpelah. There is a collection of ancient texts primarily linked to Gen- 
esis known as The Cave of Treasures, referring to the cave in which Adam was said to 
have hid the incense and later to have been buried there.

446. ABRAHAM'S DAUGHTER 

In his old age, God blessed Abraham in all things (Gen. 24:1) What does this mean? It means 
that in addition to wealth and length of years, God gave Abraham a daughter. For surely 
having everything includes having both a son and a daughter. But where did this daugh- 
ter come from? After all, she was bom after the death of Sarah, and before Abraham 
married Keturah. 

Some say that this daughter, whose name was Bakol ("In-AU-Things"), was a child of 
Hagar, and that she was bom after Ishmael repented of his evil ways. 



MYTHS OF ISAAC 345 


Some say that Sarah not only gave birth to Isaac, but bore a daughter as well, who took 
care of Abraham in his old age. Others say that this daughter was actually an angel, who 
guarded Abraham so closely that everyone believed her to be his daughter. Still others 
say that she was not a daughter at all, but the wandering spirit of Sarah, who, having 
spent most of her life with Abraham, now returned to serve him after she departed from 
this world. 

Just who this daughter was remains a mystery. Only this much is known: Abraham 
loved her dearly, and taught her all that he had learned, and she was the center of Abraham's 
household. And when Abraham took leave of this world, his daughter carried his teach- 
ings to the ends of the earth. And when the time came for her to take leave of this world, 
she joined him on high, and she still accompanies him in the World to Come. 

In order to fulfill the commandment to have children, it was regarded as necessary 
to have both a son and daughter. Since Genesis 24:1 states that Abraham was blessed 
"in all things," this was understood to mean that he also had a daughter, although 
nothing about such a daughter is found in the biblical text.

447. THE DESCENT OF THE LIGHT-MAN 

When the time came for Abraham to take leave of this world, God sent Isaac a dream. In 
the third hour of the night Isaac woke up, got up from his bed, and ran to the room where 
his mother and father were asleep. When Isaac reached the door, he cried out, "Father, 
open the door so that I may come in." 

Abraham arose and opened the door, and Isaac entered and embraced him, crying 
loudly. And Abraham said, "Come here, son. Tell me the truth. What did you see that 
caused you to run to us in this way?" 

Isaac said, "This night. Father, I saw in a dream the sun and moon above my head. 
They surrounded me with their rays and illuminated me. And while I rejoiced in their 
presence, I saw the heavens open and I saw a luminous man descending from heaven, 
shining more than seven suns. This man came and took the sun from my head and went 
back into the heavens. Then I was very sad, because he took the sun from me. 

"A little later, while I was still mourning, he returned and took the moon from me, 
from above my head. I wept greatly and begged the Light-Man, saying "Have mercy on 
me. Take not my glory from me. If you take the sun from me, at least leave me the moon." 

The Light-Man answered, "The King on high has sent me to bring them there." And 
he took them from me, but he left the rays that shone upon me. 

Then Abraham said, "The Lord has sent an angel of God to take my soul." 

Here God sends Isaac a dream to warn him that the time has come for his father, 
Abraham, to die. In the dream Abraham and Sarah are identified as the sun and moon 
that are taken from above Isaac's head. This identification of the father and mother as 
the sun and moon is found in Joseph's dream in Genesis 37:9-10: And he dreamed yet 
another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, " Behold I have dreamed yet a dream: and 
behold, the sun and moon and eleven stars bowed down to me . " And he told it to his father, and 
to his brothers, and his father rebuked him and said, " What is this dream that you have dreamed? 

Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down to you to the earth?" 

Note that the meaning of the symbols of the sun and moon (and stars) is immediately 
understood by Jacob. Likewise, Abraham immediately understands the meaning of 



346 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


Isaac's dream, and identifies the figure of the Light-Man with an angel who has been 
sent by God to take his life. 

Although Isaac loses the sun and moon in the dream, it is interesting to note that 
after his plea to the Light-Man, the light that they cast on him remains behind. This 
light represents the glory they left behind in the form of Abraham's covenant with 
God. 

The figure of the Light-Man is found in Gnostic texts. Here the Light-Man is said to 
have existed even before the demiurge. The Light-Man is closely identified with a 
Gnostic angel known as the Light-Adam in On the Origins of the World 108:2ff. 

This myth of the descent of the Light-Man is found in The Testament of Abraham , a 
pseudepigraphal text of Jewish origins that recounts Abraham's resistance to leaving 
this world with the Angel of Death. Similar resistance is found in midrashic legends 
about Moses. Thus both of these patriarchal figures receive special attention from 
God when the time comes for them to take leave of this world, and both of them put 
up considerable resistance, so great is their passion to remain alive.

448. ABRAHAM AND THE ANGEL OF DEATH 

God called upon the Angel of Death and said, "Come, hide your ferocity, cover your 
decay, and put on your youthful beauty and go down to Abraham and take him and 
bring him to Me. But do not terrify him; instead, take him with soft speech. So Death put 
on a radiant robe and assumed the form of an archangel and went to Abraham. 

Abraham sat at the entrance of his tent in Mamre when a sweet odor came to him, and 
Abraham saw Death coming toward him in great glory. So Abraham arose and went to 
meet him, and Death knelt before him and said, "Most righteous Abraham, I am the 
bitter cup of death." Abraham said, "No, you have the glory and beauty of an angel." 
Death said, "I am telling you the truth." 

Abraham said, "Why have you come here?" Death answered, "I have come for your 
holy soul." But Abraham refused to go with him, and arose and went into his house. 
Death followed him there, and went with him wherever he went in the house. Death 
said, "I will not depart until I take your spirit." 

Then Abraham said, "I beg you, heed me and show me your ferocity." But Death said, 
"You could not bear to behold it, righteous Abraham." Abraham said, "Yes, I can, be- 
cause the power of God is with me." 

Then Death put off the bloom of youth and beauty and put on his robe of tyranny, and 
made his appearance gloomy and ferocious. He showed Abraham seven fiery heads of 
dragons and other faces, most horrible, each one fiercer than the other, including the face 
of a lion, the face of a homed serpent, and that of a cobra. And after he saw these things, 
Abraham said, "I beg you. Death, hide your ferocity and put on the form of youthful 
beauty that you had before." 

Death hid his ferocious visage at once, and put on his youthful beauty. Then Abraham 
went to his room and lay down. And Death said to Abraham, "Come, kiss my right hand, 
and may life and strength come to you." But Death deceived Abraham, for when Abraham 
kissed his hand, his soul cleaved to Death's hand. At that moment the angel Michael, 
along with multitudes of angels, carried away Abraham's precious soul in their hands, in 
divinely woven linen. 



MYTHS OF ISAAC 347 


As with Moses and Rabbi Joshua ben Levi, God gave instructions to the Angel of 
Death to take Abraham gently because of his great righteousness. But when Abraham 
refuses to go, and insists that the angel reveal his true visage, he shows it to him and 
it is truly terrible. After that Abraham no longer resists the angel. 

This myth serves as a reminder that everyone, even Abraham, must one day en- 
counter the deadly angel, and as a reminder of how truly terrifying the angel is. For 
other myths about the Angel of Death, see "Rabbi Joshua ben Levi and the Angel of 
Death," p. 206, and "Rabbi Loew and the Angel of Death," p. 207.

449. ABRAHAM'S DYING VISION 

A vision came to Abraham on the day of his death. The voice of the Lord came to him and 
said, "Open your eyes, and see your reward." Then Abraham felt that he was lifted up by 
the wind, higher and higher, and suddenly he arrived at a place of great light, where 
gates of precious stones were opened before him, and myriads of angels approached 
him. They clothed him in eight garments of light, and a thousand fragrant odors came 
from the Garden of Eden and perfumed his garments. The angels put two crowns of onyx 
and fine gold on his head, and eight myrtles in his hand, and the world was filled with 
their odor. 

Then the angels brought Abraham to a place where rivers flowed with pure water, and 
roses and myrtles surrounded them, and their fragrance filled him with infinite delight. 
He came to a wonderful canopy that had been prepared for him, with four rivers flowing 
in front of it of honey, wine, oil, and balsam. Above the canopy there were golden vines 
and pearls shining like stars. 

At that instant Abraham was suddenly transformed into a happy child, and he saw a 
great many happy children coming toward him. Abraham played with them and ran 
with them to hear the wonderful songs of the angels. They walked among sweet-smell- 
ing trees and rested under the Tree of Life. Then childhood passed and youth began. The 
children vanished, and Abraham enjoyed the companionship of handsome young men, 
and they walked through the length and breadth of the garden. His soul was satisfied 
with unbounded delight. Then youth passed and old age came, and dignified old men 
spoke with him about the life of man and the ways of God. They led Abraham to his two 
canopies, one made of the light of the sun and one of the light of the moon. Abraham saw 
that there was a partition of lightning between them. He passed through the partition 
and beheld three hundred and ten marvelous worlds. Then the voice of the Lord came to 
Abraham, saying, "What you see now is but the fringe of Paradise; you cannot see the 
whole of it except with the eyes of God." And Abraham said, "O Lord, take my soul to 
rest." And God took the soul of Abraham to heaven Himself, and so Abraham's life on 
earth came to an end. 

Before dying, God sends Abraham a wonderful vision of the reward awaiting him 
in the Garden of Eden. In the course of this vision he relives his life, from childhood to 
old age. Finally Abraham leams that all the wonders he has seen and experienced — 
with considerable emphasis on the visual and sensual delights — are but the fringes of 
Paradise. God makes the interesting observation that the whole can only be seen with 
the eyes of God. (See "The Eyes of God," p. 21.) Thus reassured, Abraham requests 
that God take his soul, and thus dies peacefully. 

Abraham's ascent into Paradise is similar to those of Adam in Vita Adae et Evae and 
those of Enoch in the Books of Enoch. Moses also ascended on high, as did the four 



348 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


sages who entered Paradise. See "The Ascent of Moses," p. 171 and "The Four Who 
Entered Paradise," p. 173. 

This account is in stark contrast to many of the traditions about the death of Moses, 
who is said to have fiercely resisted the Angel of Death. But in the end, as with Abraham, 
it is God Himself who takes his soul.

450. ABRAHAM NEVER DIED 

There are those who insist that Abraham never died, and that he continues to wander the 
world. There are many reports of those who have seen him. One story tells of a mysteri- 
ous Tenth Man. 

For many years only a few Jews were permitted by the Muslim authorities to live in 
Hebron, where the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives are buried. Once 
there were so few that on the eve of Yom Kippur, only nine Jews had gathered in the 
House of Prayer in the city of Hebron, and there was no one else they could call on to 
complete the minyan. The sun was setting, but they could not begin Kol Nidrei. 

Just then there was a knock on the door, and when the gabbai answered it, he found an 
old Jew standing there, a stranger with a long white beard, wearing a white robe, carry- 
ing a white tallit. The gabbai gladly invited him in and asked to know his name. The old 
man said it was Abraham. Then, since the tenth man had arrived, they began the prayers, 
and the old man joined in with them. 

The old man remained there with them, praying all night and the next day, until Yom 
Kippur had come to an end. Never before had they prayed for so long without stopping, 
but somehow not one of them felt fired, nor did hunger pangs trouble them. All were 
aware that the power of the Divine Presence filled the House of Prayer. 

When the Day of Atonement had ended, the old man took his leave, but he left his 
tallit behind. The gabbai hurried after him to return it, but he was nowhere to be found. 
That night the gabbai had a dream in which the old man returned to him and revealed 
that he was actually the patriarch Abraham. So too did he reveal that he had left the tallit 
behind for him and that it was sacred. For if he wore it when he prayed, he would be 
permitted a vision of the Divine Presence. The gabbai told the others his dream, and they 
were filled with wonder to learn the true identity of the old man. 

The gabbai put on the tallit of Abraham when he prayed that day. And during the silent 
prayer, when he closed his eyes for an instant, he saw a vision of the Divine Presence 
glowing in the dark. Afterward, whenever he closed his eyes, the vision would return, as 
if it were imprinted there. 

As for the tallit, it is said that Abraham returned to the gabbai in a dream shortly before 
he died, and told him to request that he be buried in it. This was done, and no sooner did 
they cover his body with that prayer shawl than his soul found itself in Paradise, inside 
the synagogue of Abraham the patriarch. There he was made gabbai in that heavenly 
House of Prayer, where he serves the patriarch Abraham to this day, still wrapped in that 
sacred tallit. 

There is an extensive tradition attributing immortality to the key patriarchal fig- 
ures. Not only is Abraham portrayed as never having died, but there are also accounts 
about Jacob, Moses, and King David still being alive. Some of these are found in rab- 
binic sources, and others in Jewish folklore, some of it still recounted orally by the 



MYTHS OF ISAAC 349 


Lubavitch Hasidim and in other Orthodox circles, as in this case. This is a well-known 
medieval folktale that has entered later Orthodox oral tradition as if it were a midrash.

451. THE BIRTHS OF JACOB AND ESAU 

Isaac pleaded with the Lord on behalf of his wife, because she was barren; and the Lord 
responded to his plea, and his wife Rebecca conceived. But the children struggled in her 
womb, and she said, "If so, why do I exist?" She went to inquire of the Lord, and the Lord 
answered her, "Two nations are in your womb, two separate peoples shall issue from your 
body; one people shall be mightier than the other, and the older shall serve the younger." 

When her time to give birth was at hand, there were twins in her womb. The first one 
emerged red all over; so they named him Esau. Then his brother emerged, holding on to 
the heel of Esau; so they named him Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when they were bom. 

The rabbis were well aware that the portrayal of Jacob in Genesis revealed many 
negative qualities about him. They were loath to accept this portrayal, because Jacob 
was an important patriarch, and especially because his name became Israel, from which 
the nation of Israel took its name. Therefore there is an intensive whitewashing pro- 
cess found in the rabbinic texts. Some midrashim attribute intention to the unborn 
twins, Jacob and Esau, and shows that their conflict started in the womb. Genesis Kabbah 
63:6 describes how when Rebecca stood near a synagogue, Jacob struggled to come 
out. When she passed idolatrous temples, Esau struggled to come out. Rebecca went 
to the academy of Shem and Eber, and they explained that "There are two nations in 
your womb. At their birth they will be separated. One will enjoy the pleasures of this 
world, and the other the delights of the world to come/' 

Another midrash asserts that Jacob was destined to be bom first, but Esau refused 
to accept this, and therefore Jacob held back in order not to harm his mother, Rebecca, 
but that he held on to Esau's heel as a sign that it was he who was really supposed to 
have been the eldest. This view thus justifies Jacob's forcing Esau to sell his birthright 
to him, and Jacob's later stealing his brother's blessing, and therefore goes a long way 
toward mitigating the acts that otherwise identify Jacob as one who tricked and cheated 
his father and his brother (Midrash ha-Gadol 1:390-391).

Genesis 25:21-26. 


452. ISAAC RETURNS TO MOUNT MORIAH 

After Isaac took Rebecca as his wife, she was barren for twenty-two years. So Isaac took 
Rebecca with him and went back to Mount Moriah, to the place where he had been bound, 
and he prayed that she should conceive, as it is said, Isaac pleaded with Yahweh on behalf of his 
wife (Gen. 25:21). And by his prayer Isaac changed the intention of God, who had decreed 
that he and Rebecca would be barren. After that, Rebecca became pregnant with twins. 

This legend from Targum Pseudo-Yonathan adds an important detail to Genesis 25:21- 
23, where Isaac prays that Rebecca should conceive. It identifies the place of his prayer 
as Mount Moriah. On the one hand, this is strange, since Isaac's experience there was 
so traumatic. On the other hand, Isaac was well aware that it was a holy place, where 
he could communicate with God. See "The Births of Jacob and Esau," p. 349.

453. THE BARTERED BIRTHRIGHT 

When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the outdoors; but Jacob 
was a mild man who stayed in camp. Isaac favored Esau because he had a taste for game; 
but Rebecca favored Jacob. Once when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the 
open, famished. And Esau said to Jacob, 'Give me some of that red stuff to gulp down, 
for I am famished"— which is why he was named Edom. Jacob said, "First sell me your 
birthright. And Esau said, "I am at the point of death, so of what use is my birthright to 
me?" But Jacob said, "Swear to me first." So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to 
Jacob. Jacob then gave Esau bread and lentil stew; he ate and drank, and he rose and 
went away. Thus did Esau spurn the birthright. 

This famous episode from Genesis clearly establishes the pattern between Jacob and 
Esau, in which Jacob plays an underhanded role in forcing his brother to sell his birth- 
right for a bowl of lentils. It is hard, if not impossible, to justify Jacob's behavior, al- 
though the midrashic texts try to do this by asserting that Jacob was destined to be bom 
first, but he and Esau struggled in the womb, and Jacob permitted Esau to go first so as 
not to harm their mother, Rebecca {Genesis Rabbah 67:6). The idea of selling something of 
value for something worthless has become an aphorism about selling something of 
value for a bowl of pottage. 

Sources: 

Genesis 25:27-34. 


454. RED LENTILS 

Lentils are the food of mourning and sorrow. When Cain killed Abel, Adam and Eve ate 
lentils as a sign of their mourning over him. And when Haran was burned in Nimrod's 
furnace, his parents ate lentils as a sign of mourning. And when his grandfather, Abra ham ^ 
died, Jacob boiled dishes of lentils as a sign of mourning and sorrow, and as a sign that it 
was a house of mourning. Then he went to comfort his father, Isaac. 

The lentils were a sign of mourning, but Esau was unconcerned about the death of his 
grandfather; nothing mattered but satisfying his hunger. This proves that he not only gave 
up his birthright, he rejected belief in the resurrection of the dead as well. Therefore he was 
undeserving of his birthright. How do we know that God agreed with this? Because it says. 
Thus says Yahweh: "Israel is My first-bom son" (Exod. 4:22). Then Gabriel and Michael re- 
corded that the birthright belonged to Jacob. And since the birthright was his, so too was 
the Blessing of the Firstborn, which belonged to the one who possessed the birthright. 

This midrash is part of an extensive reinterpretation of Jacob's acts in order to 
justify everything he did, since he, more than any other patriarch, is identified with 
the nation of Israel. That is because Jacob's name is changed to Israel in Genesis 32:29, 
after he wrestles with the angel. Here, to justify Jacob's behavior in requiring his brother 
to pay with his birthright for a dish of lentils, B. Bava Batra 16b suggests that Abraham, 
the grandfather of Jacob and Esau, had died that day, and that Jacob had prepared the 
dish to comfort his father, Isaac. Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 35 states that, "Lentils are the 
food of mourning and sorrow." Thus their preparation would indicate a house of 
mourning. Targum Pseudo-Yonathan on Genesis 25:29 inserts into the biblical text: "The 
day Abraham died, Jacob boiled dishes of lentils and went to comfort his father." This 
traditional sign of mourning is also linked to Adam and Eve and to the death of Haran, 
suggesting that it was an old and widely known custom, and therefore Esau should 
have immediately asked if anyone had died. Because he did not, he proved himself to 
be unworthy of his birthright and the Blessing of the Firstborn. 



MYTHS OF JACOB 351 


B. Bava Batra 16b considers the appropriateness of the lentil as a sign of mourning: 
"Just as a lentil is round, so mourning comes around to everyone in the world. Just as 
a lentil has no mouth, so a mourner has no mouth, for a mourner does not speak." 
Lentils have continued to be used as a food prepared for Jewish mourners.

p. 353. For more on the cult of Jacob that greatly elevated his status to the near-divine, 
see "Jacob the Angel," p. 364, and "Jacob the Divine," p. 366.

455. ISAAC'S EYES GROW DIM 

When Abraham tied Isaac down to the altar at Mount Moriah, Isaac lifted up his eyes 
heavenwards and saw the glory of the Shekhinah. After that his eyes began to grow dim, 
as it is said. When Isaac was old and his eyes were too dim to see (Gen. 27:1). 

This midrash links Isaac's being bound on Mount Moriah with his blindness in his old 
age. It is part of a tradition that Isaac had an intense mystical experience on Mount Moriah. 

In other versions, the tears of the angels on high, watching the drama unfold, fell into 
Isaac's eyes and brought on his subsequent blindness. See "Isaac's Ascent," p. 171.

456. THE STOLEN BLESSING 

When Isaac was old and his eyes were too dim to see, he called his older son Esau and 
said to him, "My son." He answered, "Here I am." And he said, "I am old now, and I do 
not know how soon I may die. Take your gear, your quiver and bow, and go out into the 
open and hunt me some game. Then prepare a dish for me such as I like, and bring it to 
me to eat, so that I may give you my innermost blessing before I die." 

Rebecca had been listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau had gone out into 
the open to hunt game to bring home, Rebecca said to her son Jacob, "I overheard your 
father speaking to your brother Esau, saying, 'Bring me some game and prepare a dish for 
me to eat, that I may bless you, with the Lord's approval, before I die/ Now, my son, listen 
carefully as I instruct you. Go to the flock and fetch me two choice kids, and I will make of 
them a dish for your father, such as he likes. Then take it to your father to eat, in order that 
he may bless you before he dies." Jacob answered his mother Rebecca, "But my brother 
Esau is a hairy man and I am smooth skinned. If my father touches me, I shall appear to 
him as a trickster and bring upon myself a curse, not a blessing." But his mother said to 
him, "Your curse, my son, be upon me! Just do as I say and go fetch them for me." 

He got them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared a dish such as 
his father liked. Rebecca then took the best clothes of her older son Esau, which were 
there in the house, and had her younger son Jacob put them on; and she covered his 
hands and the hairless part of his neck with the skins of the kids. Then she put in the 
hands of her son Jacob the dish and the bread that she had prepared. 

He went to his father and said, "Father." And he said, "Yes, which of my sons are 
you?" Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau, your firstborn; I have done as you told me. 
Pray sit up and eat of my game, that you may give me your innermost blessing." Isaac 



352 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


said to his son, "How did you succeed so quickly, my son?" And he said, "Because the 
Lord your God granted me good fortune. Isaac said to Jacob, "Come closer that I may 
feel you, my son— whether you are really my son Esau or not." So Jacob drew close to his 
father Isaac, who felt him and wondered. "The voice is the voice of Jacob, yet the hands 
are the hands of Esau. He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like 
those of his brother Esau; and so he blessed him. 

He asked, "Are you really my son Esau?" And when he said, "I am," he said, "Serve 
me and let me eat of my son's game that I may give you my innermost blessing." So he 
served him and he ate, and he brought him wine and he drank. Then his father Isaac said 
to him, "Come close and kiss me, my son;" and he went up and kissed him. And he 
smelled his clothes and he blessed him, saying, "Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell 
of the fields that the Lord has blessed. May God give you of the dew of heaven and the fat 
of the earth, abundance of new grain and wine. Let peoples serve you, and nations bow 
to you; be master over your brothers, and let your mother's sons bow to you. Cursed be 
they who curse you, blessed they who bless you." 

No sooner had Jacob left the presence of his father Isaac— after Isaac had finished 
blessing Jacob than his brother Esau came back from his hunt. He too prepared a dish 
and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, "Let my father sit up and eat of his 
son's game, so that you may give me your innermost blessing." His father Isaac said to 
him. Who are you? ' And he said, "I am your son, Esau, your first-born!" Isaac was 
seized with very violent trembling. "Who was it then," he demanded, "that hunted game 
and brought it to me? Moreover, I ate of it before you came, and I blessed him; now he 
must remain blessed!" When Esau heard his father's words, he burst into wild and bitter 
sobbing, and said to his father, "Bless me too. Father!" But he answered, "Your brother 
came with guile and took away your blessing." Esau said, "Was he, then, named Jacob 
that he might supplant me these two times? First he took away my birthright and now he 
has taken away my blessing!" And he added, "Have you not reserved a blessing for me?" 
Isaac answered, saying to Esau, "But I have made him master over you: I have given him 
all his brothers for servants, and sustained him with grain and wine. What, then, can I 
still do for you, my son?" And Esau said to his father, "Have you but one blessing. Fa- 
ther? Bless me too. Father!" And Esau wept aloud. And his father Isaac answered, saying 
to him, "See, your abode shall enjoy the fat of the earth and the dew of heaven above. Yet 
by your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother; but when you grow 
restive, you shall break his yoke from your neck." 

Now Esau harbored a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing that his father had 
given him, and Esau said to himself, "Let but the mourning period of my father come, 
and I will kill my brother Jacob." When the words of her older son Esau were reported to 
Rebecca, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, "Your brother Esau is con- 
soling himself by planning to kill you. Now, my son, listen to me. Flee at once to Haran, 
to my brother Laban. Stay with him a while, until your brother's fury subsides— until 
your brother's anger against you subsides— and he forgets what you have done to him. 
Then I will fetch you from there. Let me not lose you both in one day!" 

Before his death, Isaac calls in Esau to give him the Blessing of the Firstborn, which 
entitles him to virtually all of his father's property under the rights of primogeniture. 
Nevertheless, there are many cases in the Bible in which the firstborn did not receive 
a preferential share. These include Ishmael and Isaac, Esau and Jacob, Reuben and 
Joseph, and Joseph s sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. A modified version of the rights of 
primogeniture is given in Deuteronomy 21:15-17, which establishes that a man's prop- 
erty is inherited by his sons, the firstborn receiving a double share. 



MYTHS OF JACOB 353 


Rebecca schemes with Jacob to have him impersonate his brother and steal the bless- 
ing. For once it had been given, it could not be retrieved. The plan works, although 
Jacob lies to his father twice: once when Isaac asks if he is Esau, and by wearing goatskin 
on his hands, to make them appear hairy. Still, Isaac almost sees through the ruse: "The 
voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau" (Gen. 27:23). 

It was to receive this blessing that Jacob forced Esau to sell him his birthright. 
Having purchased it with a bowl of lentil stew, Jacob may have felt that he deserved 
the blessing from his father. See "The Bartered Birthright," p. 350. 

This narrative reads like a staged play. Isaac calls in Esau; Rebecca plots with Jacob; 
Esau leaves, Jacob enters; Jacob leaves, Esau enters. It is a marvel of condensed under- 
statement, but after this episode Rebecca and Jacob can never be viewed in the same 
light. Honor your father and mother is one of the Ten Commandments, and Jacob clearly 
does not honor his father in this story. He and Rebecca treat Isaac like an old, blind fool, 
who can easily be tricked. They also assume that Esau can be deceived. After this epi- 
sode and that of the bartered birthright, Jacob's image as a trickster is imprinted for all 
time. Furthermore, this incident causes Jacob and Esau to become enemies, and Jacob is 
forced to flee to the home of his uncle Laban in Haran. Yet, ironically, this journey leads 
Jacob to discover the God of his fathers and to fulfill his destiny. In the end, Jacob the 
trickster has transformed into Jacob the patriarch, even though he does cross his arms 
when asked to bless Joseph's sons, and gives the Blessing of the Firstborn to the younger 
instead of to the elder. At that moment we catch a clear glimpse of Jacob the trickster 
(Gen. 48:8-15), as well as Jacob's rebellion against the right of ligature. 

The Ugaritic stories of Aqhat have distinct parallels to this biblical episode, where 
the role of Esau is played by Aqhat the hunter, and the role of Rebecca is played by 
Anat, who tries to steal his inheritance.

457. JACOB THE BLESSED 

When Jacob entered into the presence of his father. Paradise entered with him. Isaac blessed 
Jacob with ten blessings, corresponding to the ten words by which the world was cre- 
ated. And when Jacob went forth from the presence of his father Isaac, he went forth 
crowned like a bridegroom, and the quickening dew from heaven descended upon him 
and refreshed his bones, and he became a mighty hero. That is why it is said. By the hands 
of the Mighty One of Jacob — there, the Shepherd , the Rock of Israel (Gen. 49:24). 

♦ 

The clear sense of the biblical text is that the plot of Rebecca and Jacob to trick Isaac 
is wrong. But because of the identification of Jacob with Israel, the midrashic text goes 
to extremes to justify his actions. Here, rather than leaving Isaac's tent like a thief, 

Jacob is described as going forth crowned like a bridegroom. This is part of the pro- 
cess by which all of Jacob's actions are whitewashed, while everything that Esau does 
is painted black. For example, Targum Pseudo-Yonathan on Genesis 25:29 states that 
"Esau came from the country, and he was exhausted because he had committed five 
transgressions that day: he had practiced idolatry; he had shed innocent blood; he 
had lain with a betrothed maiden; he had denied the life of the world to come; and he 
had despised his birthright."

364, and "Jacob the Divine," p. 366.

354 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


458. RACHEL AND THE STOLEN IDOLS 


Rachel stole the idols of her father, Laban, as it is said, Rachel, meanwhile, had taken the idols 
(Gen. 31:34). But why did she take them? 

Some say that she didn't want her father to worship idols. But if so, why did she take 
them with her, and not bury them on the way, rather than hiding them in her saddlebags? 

Others say that Rachel stole the Terafim because she knew that Laban was a great sor- 
cerer who practiced all kinds of magical arts, and that he knew how to compel the Terafim 
to reveal Jacob s whereabouts to Laban. How could they do that? Because they were not 
idols of clay or stone, but speaking heads that could be made to reveal secrets, as it is 
said. For the Terafim spoke delusion (Zech. 10:2). Rachel knew that Laban would force the 
Terafim to reveal the direction Jacob had taken. Thus, since Rachel knew the powers of the 
Terafim and the dangers they posed, she took them with her, so Laban would not be able 
to use the Terafim against them. 

How were the Terafim made? They would slay a firstborn, cut off his head, remove the 
hair, and sprinkle it with salt and spices. Then they would write magical formulas and 
names of unclean spirits on a golden tablet and put it under his tongue. They would set 
it up on the wall, and at certain times of the day the Terafim would absorb celestial influ- 
ences. Then, when they wanted to divine, they would light candles, and bow down in 
front of it. Then when the head was questioned, it would be forced to respond to any 
questions asked of it. And it was to these idols that Laban bowed down. 

As for those who made the Terafim, as well as those who used them, every one was 
sent down to Gehenna to be punished. 

Laban was distraught because his Terafim, whom he called his "gods"— (Why did 
you steal my gods? (Gen. 31:30), were taken when Jacob and his family took flight. 

The Torah states quite explicitly that it was Rachel who took them: Rachel, meanwhile, 
had taken the idols (Gen. 31:34). Rachel's actions in this case perplexed the commenta- 
tors. They didn't want to consider that she stole them because she was attached to 
them, or because she believed that the one who possessed them had the power of the 
gods at his command. This dilemma gave birth to one of the strangest midrashim, 
which asserts that the Terafim actually were speaking heads. Drawing a hint from the 
verse For the Terafim spoke delusion (Zech. 10:2), this midrash presumes that the Terafim 
could speak. This leads to a barbaric description of how the heads were obtained, 
found in Midrash Tanhuma-Yelammedenu, Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer, and other sources, in 
which a firstborn son was sacrificed and his head cut off. After it had been shrunken 
with salt and oil, an amulet bearing the name of an evil spirit was placed beneath the 
tongue. As a result, whenever people invoked that evil spirit, they could force these 
heads to speak and to reveal everything they wanted to know. In this way Rachel's 
incriminating actions are fully explained: she was simply trying to prevent the Terafim 
from assisting her father in finding Jacob and his family. 

Ibn Ezra indicates the controversy about the very meaning of the term Terafim: 

"Some say that the Terafim are copper objects used to tell time. Others say that astrolo- 
gers have the power to make an image that speaks at certain times." Ibn Ezra also 
gives an explanation for Rachel's taking the Terafim that links them to astrology, while 
identifying Laban as an astrologer: "The most likely reason that Rachel stole the Terafim 
was that Laban, her father, was an astrologer, and Rachel feared that he would look at 
the stars and discover which way they fled." This suggests that the Terafim drew their 
power from the stars and revealed hidden things to Laban. 

Note that there is a shift from the identification of the Terafim as wooden or stone idols 
that would be the objects of worship, to speaking heads whose primary purpose is to 
divine. This change alleviates the suspicion that Rachel took the Terafim in order to wor- 
ship them. But it also seems to contradict Laban's assertion that the Terafim were his "gods." 



MYTHS OF JA&lt;OB 355 


The barbaric custom described here seems completely outside of Jewish tradition. 
It not only involves ritual murder of a firstborn son, but knowledge of techniques that 
one would associate with cannibals. The primary point of the account of the binding 
of Isaac in Genesis 22 is that there would be no more ritual sacrifice of children. Thus 
the clear indication is that the creation of the Terafim was not a Jewish practice. Nor, 
for that matter, was Laban Jewish. It is hard to find a similarly barbaric example in 
Jewish myth except for the Yemenite folktale that Adam and Eve devoured the son of 
Samael. See "How Samael Entered the Heart of Man," p. 454. 

Joseph Dan links this ingenious explanation of why Rachel stole the idols with a 
nineteenth-century folktale. See "Terafim: From Popular Belief to a Folktale." This is a 
story about a boy kidnapped by a demon disguised as a wealthy merchant so that his 
head could be cut off and serve as one of these Terafim. Apparently Terafim only last for 
80 years, and then must be replaced. The story describes the boy's escape from the castle 
of demons with the crucial aid of the speaking head he finds there and takes with him. 
Thus he behaves as does Rachel, and for the same reason — because the Terafim could be 
forced to speak. See "The Speaking Head" in Lilith's Cave , pp. 148-159. 

Rabbinic commentary links Jacob's vow to Laban, " But anyone with whom you find 
your gods shall not remain alive!" (Gen. 31:32) with the premature death of Rachel. In his 
Torah commentary. Rabbi Bachya ben Asher (1260-1340) says, "This curse resulted in 
Rachel's dying on the journey." Of course, there is nothing in the text to indicate that 
Jacob had any idea Rachel had taken the Terafim. But many midrashim suggest that 
Jacob's words turned into a dreadful curse that may have inadvertently brought about 
Rachel's early death, and prevented her from being buried in the Cave of Machpelah.

459, JACOB'S DREAM 

Jacob left Beersheva, and set out for Haran. He came upon a certain place and stopped 
there for the night, for the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of that place, he put it 
under his head and lay down in that place. He had a dream; a stairway was set on the 
ground and its top reached to the sky, and angels of God were going up and down on it. 
And the Lord was standing beside him and He said, "I am the Lord, the God of your 
father Abraham and the God of Isaac: the ground on which you are lying I will assign to 
you and to your offspring. Your descendants shall be as the dust of the earth; you shall 
spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All the families of the 
earth shall bless themselves by you and your descendants. Remember, I am with you: I 
will protect you wherever you go and will bring you back to this land. I will not leave 
you until I have done what I have promised you." 

Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, "Surely the Lord is present in this place, and I did 
not know it!" Shaken, he said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the 
abode of God, and that is the gateway to heaven." Early in the morning, Jacob took the 
stone that he had put under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on the top of 
it. He named that site Bethel; but previously the name of the city had been Luz. 

This memorable dream of Jacob has been subjected to extensive rabbinic interpre- 
tation. In Genesis Rabbah 68:12, there is a discussion about its symbolic meaning. The 



356 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


first interpretation comes from Bar Kappara, who viewed the dream as referring to 
the sacrifices made by the priests in the Temple: "No dream is without its interpreta- 
tion. And behold a ladder (Gen. 28:12) symbolizes the stairway. Set upon the earth (Gen. 

™ i?! r ! fe f S t0 4116 altar ' as i4 is said ' An altar °f earth y° u sha,! make unto Me (Exod. 
20:21). And the top of it reached to heaven (Gen. 28:12) refers to the sacrifices, the odor of 

which ascended on high. And behold the angels of God (Gen. 28:13) refers to the High 
Priests. Ascending and descending on it (Gen. 28:12) refers to ascending and descending 
the stairway. And, behold, the Lord stood beside him (Gen. 28:13), refers to I saw the Lord 
standing beside the altar (Amos 9:1)." 

Other rabbis related the dream to Mount Sinai: "And he dreamed, and behold a ladder 
symbolizes Sinai. Set upon the earth refers to And they took their places at the foot of the 
mountain (Exod. 19:17). And the top of it reached to heaven refers to The mountain was 
ablaze with flames to the very skies (Deut. 4:11). And behold the angels of God alludes to 
Moses and Aaron. Ascending (Gen. 28:13) refers to And Moses went up to God (Exod. 
19.3). And descending (Gen. 28:13) refers to And Moses came down from the mountain 
(Exod. 19:14). And, behold, the Lord stood beside him (Gen. 28:13) refers to The Lord came 
down upon Mount Sinai (Exod. 19:20)."

Genesis 28:10-19. 


460. MEETING THE PLACE 

Jacob left Beersheva and went to Haran. On the way to Haran, he met the place (Gen 
28:11). What does this mean? That Jacob did indeed go all the way to Haran. Then he 
remembered that he had passed the place where his father and grandfather had prayed, 
and he had failed to stop. He said to himself, "Is it possible that I passed by the place 
where my forefathers prayed and I did not pray?" Just as his forefathers prayed for the 
building of Jerusalem and the holy Temple, and their prayers were answered during the 
time of the two Temples, so too did Jacob want to pray for the future rebuilding of Jerusa- 
lem and the Temple. 

At that moment a miracle occurred, and he immediately arrived at that place, the site 
where, in the future, the Temple would one day be built. There Jacob prayed as never 
before. And when he finished praying, the sun, which was high in the sky, set two hours 
before its time. 

That is why Jacob decided to sleep there, for it had already grown dark. And as he lay 
down, God folded up the whole of the Land of Israel and placed it beneath Jacob, and 
that is the meaning of the verse "The ground on which you are lying I will assign to you and to 
your offspring " (Gen. 28:13). And that night Jacob dreamed of the ladder reaching from 
earth to heaven, with angels ascending and descending on it. And when he awoke he 
understood that it was indeed a holy place, the very gate of heaven. 

This midrash responds to the strange language of he met the place (Gen. 28:11) by 
suggesting that a miracle occurred, and he was transported to that place, which is iden- 
tified as the same spot where Abraham and Isaac had prayed. So too does the sun set 
before its time. This second miracle, of the sun setting prematurely, is parallel to the 
stopping of the sun in the Book of Joshua: And the sun stood still, and the moon halted (Josh. 

10.13). The place where Jacob s dream takes place is identified by the rabbis as Mount 
Moriah, where the future Temple would be built. Genesis Rabbah quotes God as saying 
to Jacob: "On your departure I caused the orb of the sun to set for you, and on your 
return I restored to you the hours you lost." This is an example of how anything is 
possible for God, even changing the natural order that He Himself had created. 



MYTHS OF JACOB 357 


According to Ba'al Shem Tov, God rolled up all of the Holy Land and put it under 
Jacob so that he would not have to travel everywhere in the land to retrieve the holy 
sparks that had been scattered there at the time of the shattering of the vessels. In- 
stead, he would find all the sparks in one place (Sefer Ba'al Shem Tov, va-Yetze 8, 9).

461. JACOB'S VISION 

Jacob was traveling alone from Beersheva to Haran. Along the way, he met the place (Gen. 
28:11). Why did Jacob choose to stop there? 

Some say that Jacob had a vision when he reached that place of the Holy Temple being 
built, destroyed, and then restored to its full perfection. 

Others say that he saw two Jerusalems, one of earth and one of heaven. 

Still others say that as he approached, he saw the Shekhinah hovering over that place, 
in the site where the future Temple would be built. 

Then there are those who say that when Jacob reached that place, the world became 
like a wall before him, and he had no choice but to stop. 

Jacob's comments about the place where he had his dream of the heavenly ladder 
demonstrate that it was inherently sacred: "How full of awe is this place. This is none 
other than the abode of God and that is the gateway of heaven" (Gen. 28:17). These myths 
attempt to offer a reason for Jacob deciding to stop there. Three of these suggest that 
Jacob had a vision linked with the Temple that would be built in Jerusalem. In the 
rabbinic view, Jacob's vision took place on Mount Moriah, just as did Abraham's sac- 
rifice of the ram caught in the thorns, and Mount Moriah was identical, in this mythic 
view, with the place of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. 

The fourth interpretation, from Genesis Rabbah , states that Jacob could not go on, 
for "the world became like a wall before him." Here God is portrayed as leaving Jacob 
no choice but to stop there, much as, in one myth, God compels Israel to accept the 
Torah by holding Mount Sinai over their heads (B. Shab. 88a). See "God Offers the 
Torah to Israel," p. 264. 

Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 21:5 explains that God envisioned the Temple built, destroyed, 
and rebuilt from the very beginning. It links Genesis 1:1 to the building of the Temple, 
Genesis 1:2 to the destruction of the Temple, and Genesis 1:3 to the rebuilding of the 
Temple at the End of Days.

462. JACOB'S HEAVENLY VISION 

In his dream, Jacob not only saw the ladder and the angels, but when he peered up to the 
top of the ladder he saw the face of a man, carved out of fire, peering down at him. So too 
did Jacob see God fashioning the heavenly Temple with His own hands out of jewels and 
pearls and the radiance of the Shekhinah. And when he saw that glorious Temple taking 
form on high, Jacob understood that it was the House of God that would sustain Israel 
forever, until the end of all generations. And he also understood that just as God was 
fashioning a Temple in heaven, so too would He build one in the same way on earth, as 
it is said. The sanctuary, O Yahweh, which Your hands established (Exod. 15:17). 



358 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


Then Jacob peered into the highest heaven and saw God's throne. He saw that there 
wasa face carved into the throne, and the face that Jacob saw there was his own 

Then God called out to him, saying "Jacob, Jacob!" And Jacob replied, "Here I am. Lord " 
And God revealed his covenant to Jacob, as he had to Abraham and Isaac before him. 

77ie Ladder of Jacob expands the details of Jacob's dream (Gen. 28:10-19), adding that 
"there were twelve steps leading to the top of the ladder, and on each step to the top 
there were two human faces, on the right and on the left, twenty-four faces .... And God 
was standing above its highest face, and He called to me from there, saying Jacob 
Jacob'" (The Ladder of Jacob 1:5, 1:8). The key image is that of the fiery face at the top of 
the ladder: And the top of the ladder was the face as of a man, carved out of fire" (1:4- 
5). Although the face is not identified, there is a strong implication it is that of God. 

One motivation for Jacob's vision of God at the top of the ladder in The Ladder of 
Jacob may have been a response to the biblical verse And the Lord was standing beside 
him (Gen. 28:13). God is rarely found standing on the earth, and The Ladder of Jacob 
puts God back m heaven, which is considered more appropriate. 

The tradition that God showed the heavenly and earthly Temple to Jacob (and the 
other patriarchs) is very old. Sifre on Deuteronomy 352 says of the Temple, "Jacob saw it 
built, destroyed, and rebuilt." This is derived from Genesis 28:17: Shaken, he said, "How 
awe-inspmng is this place!" This is none other than the abode of God, and that is the gateway 
to heaven. The rabbis interpret: This is none indicates that the Temple was destroyed- 
other than the abode of God and that is the gateway to heaven shows that he saw it rebuilt in 
the future. Midrash Tanhuma, va-Yetze 9 states that "the prophets also saw it built, de- 
stroyed, and rebuilt." Here God is quoted as saying: "You have seen it destroyed in 
this world, but in the World to Come I am rebuilding it Myself. I burned it, and I shall 
rebuild it." 

Other sources indicate that God showed other visions to Jacob in his dream Ac- 
cording to Midrash Tanhuma-Yelammedenu, va-Yetze 2, God showed Jacob the guardian 
angels of Babylon, Media, Greece, and Edom, all ascending and descending.

463. THE GATEWAY TO HEAVEN 

When Jacob awoke from the dream of the ladder reaching from earth to heaven, with 
angels ascending and descending on it, he said, "In truth, the Glory of the Shekhinah 
dwells in this place, and I did not know it. Shaken, he said, 'How awesome is this place!'" 
(Gen. 28:17). This is not a profane place, but a sanctuary to the name of the Lord, and this 
is a place suitable for prayer, corresponding to the Gate of Heaven, found beneath the 
Throne of Glory." 

Waking from his dream, Jacob realized he had gone to sleep in a very holy place. 

Each of Jacob's comments in Genesis 28:16-17 emphasizes its holiness. In this midrash, 
the term Shekhinah is substituted for Yahweh, the Lord. While " Shekhinah " in talmudic- 
midrashic texts is used as a designation for God, without the later kabbalistic associa- 
tions of the term as the Bride of God, it emphasizes God's divine presence in this 
world, thus Jacob's personal experience of God's presence. Jacob also identifies this 
place as a sanctuary, leading to midrashic interpretations that identified this place as 



MYTHS OF JACOB 359 


Mount Moriah, where Abraham took Isaac to be sacrificed, and as the Temple Mount 
in Jerusalem. Finally, Jacob says. This is none other than the abode of God, and that is the 
gateway to heaven. The phrase the abode of God reaffirms the idea of the place as a sanc- 
tuary, God's dwelling place in this world, which is exactly how the Temple in Jerusa- 
lem is always described. Finally, that is the gateway to heaven suggests that there was 
some kind of direct link from that place to heaven, a logical conclusion considering 
the nature of Jacob's dream, with the ladder reaching from earth to heaven, with an- 
gels ascending and descending on it. While the biblical verse may use the term "gate- 
way to heaven" in a symbolic sense, the midrashic impulse is to identify it in a literal 
sense. Here the midrash states that the place corresponds to the Gate of Heaven found 
beneath the Throne of Glory. In other words, prayer offered on earth, in that holy 
place, would be as effective as prayer offered in heaven, right before God's Throne. 
This confirms a key rabbinic /kabbalistic concept, "as above, so below."

464. JACOB WRESTLES WITH THE ANGEL 

Jacob was left alone. And a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn. When he saw 
that he had not prevailed against him, he wrenched Jacob's hip at its socket, so that the 
socket of his hip was strained as he wrestled with him. Then he said, "Let me go, for 
dawn is breaking." But he answered, "I will not let you go, unless you bless me." Said the 
other, "What is your name?" He replied, "Jacob." Said he, "Your name shall no longer be 
Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with beings divine and human, and have pre- 
vailed." Jacob asked, "Pray tell me your name." But he said, "You must not ask my name!" 
And he took leave of him there. So Jacob named the place Penuel, meaning, "I have seen 
a divine being face to face, yet my life has been preserved." The sun rose upon him as he 
passed Penuel, limping on his hip. That is why the children of Israel to this day do not eat 
the thigh muscle that is on the socket of the hip, since Jacob's hip socket was wrenched at 
the thigh muscle. 

This is one of the most important and mysterious episodes in the Torah. Here Jacob, 
exhausted from his escape from Laban and facing a small army led by his brother 
Esau, remains alone on one side of the river Yabbok and wrestles with an ish all night. 

Ish means "man," but all of the interpretations of this passage assume that Jacob 
wrestled with an angel or possibly even with God. The question is — which angel? 

There are many theories. Some assume it is Samael, who is identified as Esau's guard- 
ian angel. Samael is another name for Satan, and suggesting that he was Esau's guard- 
ian angel is a way of labeling Esau as evil. This interpretation assumes that Samael's 
goal was to wear Jacob out, so that Esau could easily defeat him the next day. Other 
interpretations identify the angel as Michael or Uriel. One of the most fascinating 
explanations is that Jacob himself was an angel, and the angel Uriel was sent to tell 
him it was time to return to heaven. See "Jacob the Angel," p. 364. 

The suggestion that Jacob wrestled with God comes from the angel's statement to 
Jacob that You have striven with beings divine and human and have prevailed (Gen. 32:29). 
Elohim, translated here as "divine beings," normally means "God." Jacob receives a 
new name, Israel, from the angel, and after this his behavior changes. He makes peace 
with Esau and takes on the role of a patriarch. Note that in Hebrew the name is Yisrael, 
which can be translated as "One who has wrestled with God." 

Because Jacob's name and the name of the people of Israel is the same, there is a 
strong identification between Jacob and the nation of Israel. One result of this strong 



360 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


identification is that a great effort is made in the rabbinic texts to justify all of Jacob's 
actions, including the bartered birthright and the stolen blessing. Another result is that 
some came to regard Jacob as a divine figure. See "Jacob the Divine," p. 366. The entire 
cycle of Jacob myths is certainly one of the most compelling in all of Jewish tradition.

465. JACOB AND ESAU'S GUARDIAN ANGEL 

The angel that wrestled with Jacob was none other than Esau's guardian angel, and that 
angel was none other than Samael. By making Jacob expend great effort all night, Samael 
hoped to weaken him, so that Esau might defeat Jacob the next day. 

But Samael did not prevail over Jacob, and before he let the angel take its leave, Jacob 
insisted that the angel bless him. And he said, "Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel, 
for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed" (Gen. 32:29). 

Why did Jacob seek the angel's blessings? The truth is that he was not demanding that 
blessing for himself, but for his descendants, the people of Israel. It meant that Samael 
could not protest whenever God decided to liberate Israel in times of danger. For the 
blessing was not for Jacob, but for Israel, and that blessing made the Exodus possible. 

This ingenious commentary by Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira, the Rebbe of the 
Warsaw Ghetto, builds on the midrashic interpretation that the angel with whom Jacob 
wrestled was Esau s guardian angel, none other than the evil angel Samael. He com- 
bines this explanation with the midrashic view that everything said about Jacob ap- 
plied to the people of Israel, since Jacob became Israel. So here the angel's forced blessing 
is said to have been intended not for Jacob, but for Israel, Jacob's descendants, and it 
saved them during times of great danger and even made the Exodus possible. 

In the following myth, "The Magic Flock," the angel Jacob wrestles with is also 
identified as Esau's guardian angel and as Samael.

466. THE MAGIC FLOCK 

When Jacob arrived at the River Yabbok, he sent his servants across first, then his wives 
and children. He himself wished to remain alone there, to rest from his escape from Laban, 
and to prepare himself for his encounter with Esau the next day. 

Soon after everyone else had crossed the river, a shepherd arrived there with his flocks. 
He proposed to Jacob that they help each other in crossing their flocks, and Jacob agreed. 
They started with Jacob s flock, and in a twinkling the shepherd succeeded in transfer- 
ring all of them to the other side. Then they turned to the shepherd's flock, and Jacob 
assisted him by carrying the animals two by two across the river. Jacob worked without 
pausing, but after he had forded the river with a great many animals, he saw that the 
flocks of the shepherd had not grown smaller but seemed to have increased. 

Still Jacob continued to bear the flocks across the river hour after hour. But as the day 
began to grow dark, he saw that the flocks of the shepherd still reached to the horizon, 
with no end in sight. Then Jacob understood that this was no ordinary shepherd, but 



MYTHS OF JA&lt;OB 361 


some kind of magician, and that all the flocks he had carried were only an illusion. In his 
fury Jacob accused the shepherd of enchantment and deceit. Then the shepherd touched 
his finger to the earth, and a great fire burst forth. But this display of his power did not 
frighten Jacob, and the two began to struggle, and they continued to wrestle all night. 

During their struggle the magician wounded Jacob in his thigh, but Jacob still contin- 
ued to fight. And as dawn approached, the magician sought to depart, but Jacob refused 
to let him go. In this way Jacob received his adversary's blessing, and his name was 
changed from Jacob to Israel. 

Some say that shepherd was Samael, the guardian angel of Esau, who came to Jacob to 
weaken him before his encounter with Esau. Others say it was the angel Michael, who 
had been sent by God to show Jacob that he, like the angels, was made of fire, and that he 
had nothing to fear from Esau. And, in truth, after this struggle Jacob was a changed 
man, who put down his weapons and his pride, and bowed seven times to his brother, 
and Esau ran to meet him and embraced him (Gen. 33:4), and at last they came together 
in peace. 

This legend is closely related to the account of Jacob's wrestling with the angel in 
Genesis 32:25-33. The identity of the sorcerer thus depends on the identity given to the 
angel, or whoever it was that Jacob wrestled. Most accounts identify this figure as the 
angel Michael or as the guardian angel of Esau, who, disguised as a shepherd, first got 
Jacob to agree that they would assist each other in carrying their flocks across the river 
Yabbok, and then created the illusion of so many flocks, attempting to exhaust Jacob 
before they wrestled and before Jacob's encounter with Esau the next day. This guard- 
ian angel of Esau is most often identified as Samael or as Sar shel Romi, the guardian 
angel of the Roman Empire, because of the close association between Esau and Rome. 

This story is of particular importance as it is an early example of an illusion tale, a type 
of tale that has a distinct and prominent place in Jewish lore. This theme was probably 
drawn into Jewish lore from oriental sources, where it also was very popular.

467. JACOB'S ASCENT ON HIGH 

It is said that the battle between Jacob and the angel did not take place on the shores of 
the River Yabbok, but in the palaces of heaven, for Jacob's soul ascended on high and 
struggled with the angel there. For ever since Jacob's dream of the ladder that reached 
from earth into heaven, his soul was able to ascend its highest rungs. 

On the night that his body lay sleeping on the shore of the River Yabbok, Jacob's soul 
did indeed ascend on high, and there he wrestled until dawn with none other than the 
angel Michael. Michael, the heavenly priest, led a choir of ministering angels in singing 
God's praises every morning, and that is why he begged, " Let me go, for dawn is breaking " 
(Gen. 32:27). 

Just then many bands of ministering angels arrived and said. The time of singing God's 
praises has come (S. of S. 2:12). Michael pleaded with Jacob, saying, "Let me go, I beg you, 
lest the ministering angels incinerate me for delaying the song." But Jacob insisted that 
he would not let him go unless he blessed him, and Michael said. Your name shall no more 
be called Jacob , but Israel (Gen. 32:29). And he added, "Blessed are you, bom of woman, for 
you entered the palace above and remained alive." 

That is when God chose to reveal Himself to Jacob and the angels. Looking up, Jacob 
saw God face to face. At that instant a change came over him, and he became Jacob the 
patriarch, father of Israel's twelve tribes. As for the angel Michael, in the presence of God 



362 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


his strength was depleted. Still, he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh and harmed him. 
But when God saw this. He said: "What right have you to cripple My priest?" Michael 
answered, "Master of the universe, am I not Your priest?" God replied: "You are My 
priest in the world above; Jacob is My priest in the world below." Then Michael sum- 
moned Raphael, the Angel of Healing, and begged him to heal Jacob. And as soon as 
Raphael touched Jacob s thigh, he recovered, and no sign of his injury remained. 

This is an unusual interpretation of the combat between Jacob and the angel in 
that, unlike virtually all of the other sources, it suggests that it took place in heaven 
rather than on earth. During the battle a band of angels appears, who are anxious to 
have Michael join them to conduct the angelic choir. Finally, God Himself appears to 
defend Jacob and to accuse Michael of misbehavior for wounding Jacob in the thigh. 

This version also differs in that it states that Jacob's wound was healed by the angel 
Raphael, while the biblical text clearly states that he was limping on his hip (Gen. 32:32). 

One of the halachic requirements to serve as High Priest was to have no physical 
imperfections. Since Jacob had set up altars and made offerings to God, he had in 
essence taken on the role of a priest, before the appearance of Aaron, brother of Moses, 
whom the Bible represents as the first High Priest. According to the Halakhah, Jacob's 
wound would have made him unable to serve as priest. Thus, in this version of the 
myth, Jacob is healed, and can thus continue his priestly role. 

This version does offer a credible reason for Michael's anxiousness — to be set free 
in order to conduct the heavenly choir. In fact, the angel fears that he will be inciner- 
ated by the other angels if he doesn't join the choir at once. The appearance of the 
angels and finally of God Himself reinforces the heavenly setting, as does Michael's 
comment to Jacob that "you entered the palace above and remained alive." 

This mythic version seems to echo the Hekhalot texts describing heavenly journeys 
into the celestial palaces, which were notoriously dangerous— the angel at the sixth 
gate would cut off the head of anyone who didn't know the right answer. ( Hekhalot 
literally means "palaces," referring to the palaces of heaven.) But here Jacob, like Rabbi 
Akiba in B. Hagigah 14b, survives the dangerous ascent intact. See "The Four Who 
Entered Paradise," p. 173. 

God identifies Jacob as His High Priest because of the biblical accounts of Jacob 
setting up an altar and making an offering to God at Beth El (Gen. 28:18 and 35:6-7) 
and other sites. Michael is said to serve as the heavenly High Priest, making offerings 
in the celestial Temple. Their competing roles as High Priest suggest a possible reason 
for their conflict, although this is never made explicit. 

Ironically, Michael is also identified in other sources as Jacob's guardian angel, 
since Michael had been appointed the guardian angel of Israel from the day he visited' 
Abraham to announce the coming birth of Isaac. Therefore Jacob might be seen as 
wrestling with his conscience. After all, he has just escaped from the forces of his 
uncle, Laban, and now he faces the forces of Esau. The bitter harvest he has brought 
upon himself has become apparent. 

In several sources the angel is not identified as Michael, but as Metatron, and the 
identities of the two angels are often switched. For more on the role of Metatron in 
these Jacob myths see the note to "Jacob the Angel," p. 364.

468. JACOB'S PILLOW 

On his journey to Haran, Jacob came to the place where he rested. Before he lay down to 
sleep. He took stones of the place, and made them his pillow (Gen. 28:11). How many stones? 
Twelve stones, one for every tribe that was destined to arise from the seed of Jacob. The 
stones began to quarrel with one another, each wanting to be the stone on which Jacob 



MYTHS OF JACOB 363 


would lay his head. Some say that God immediately made them into one stone to keep 
them from quarreling. But others say that as soon as the stones beneath his head beheld 
the glory of God, they dissolved into each other and formed one stone, just as the twelve 
tribes of Jacob would one day form the nation of Israel. Then the stone under Jacob's 
head became like a feather-bed and a pillow under him. 

Still others say that Jacob said to himself, "God has decreed that twelve tribes should 
spring forth. Now neither Abraham nor Isaac has produced them. If these twelve stones 
cleave to one another, I will know that I will produce the twelve tribes." So it was that when 
Jacob rose the next morning, he found the stones had all fused into one. So he set up that 
stone as a pillar, and oil descended for him from heaven, and he poured the oil upon it. 

What did God do then? God placed His right foot on that pillar, and sank the stone to 
the bottom of the abyss, and made it the Foundation Stone, the very navel of the world. 
That is the stone on which the Temple of the Lord was later built. 

This midrash about the fusing of the stones that Jacob used as a pillow into one 
derives from the problem created by Genesis 28:11, where it is stated that Jacob took 
stones of the place and Genesis 28:18, where it is stated that Jacob took the stone that 
he had put under his head. The midrash resolves the apparent contradiction between 
"stones" and "stone" by stating that the stones fused into one, which Jacob then used 
as a pillow. And to explain where Jacob got the oil necessary to making the offering, it 
is said to have descended from heaven. 

The striking image of God raising His right foot and driving the stone into the earth 
provides the origin of the myth of the Foundation Stone, which holds back the waters 
of the abyss. Jacob slept on a stone that is said to have formed out of twelve stones, 
representing the twelve tribes that would come into being. This symbolizes how the 
twelve tribes would become the nation of Israel. This stone is known as the spindle 
stone or foundation stone or pillar of the earth. See "The Foundation Stone," p. 96. 

The dominant myths about the foundation stone link its creation to the creation of 
the world. But here it is linked with Jacob's sacred dream, and with the holy place to 
which he had come. In fact, it is called ha-Makom, the Place, and this term not only refers 
to that place, but is one of the names of God, since Jacob beheld God in the dream. This 
strange linkage of God with a place receives a mysterious explanation in Genesis Rabbah 
68:9, which it asks, "Why do we call God 'the Place?' Because God is the place of the 
world. But we do not know whether God is the place of the world, or whether the world 
is God's place. That is why it is written. The ancient God is a refuge (Deut. 33:27)."

469. JACOB'S BOOKS 

Jacob possessed three books. One was the Book of Adam, of which it is written. This is the 
book of the generations of Adam (Gen. 5:1). The second was the Book of Enoch, which recounts 
how Enoch walked with God ; and then he was no more, for God took him (Gen. 5:24). The third 
was Abraham's Book of Creation. 

From a midrashic perspective, Jacob would have been in possession of these three 
books. The existence of the Book of Adam is derived from the verse This is the book of the 
generations of Adam (Gen. 5:1). This book is sometimes also identified with the Book of 
Raziel. For more on the latter, see "The Book of Raziel," p. 252. The Book of Enoch re- 
counts Enoch's heavenly journey, elaborating on the terse account of Enoch found in 



364 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


Genesis 5:21-24. There is also an old tradition that Abraham was author of the Sefer 
Yetzirah, the Book of Creation, the earliest kabbalistic text. Thus all three of these books 
were believed to have existed at the time of Jacob and might have been available to him. 

Jacob's access to these books provides a partial explanation for the level of spiri- 
tual achievement attributed to him in midrashic texts. See, for example, "Jacob the 
Angel/' p. 364 and "Jacob the Divine/' p. 366.

470. JACOB THE ANGEL 

Jacob was no ordinary man. If the truth be known, his true name was Israel, and he was 
an angel of God, the very archangel of the power of the Lord and the first minister before 
the face of God. Indeed, he was the first living being to whom God gave life, with the 
beauty of Adam. 

When the angel Israel descended to earth and became Jacob, he forgot his divine ori- 
gin. God tried to remind him when He sent him the dream of the ladder reaching from 
earth to heaven, so that he might glimpse the celestial world he had left behind. 

In the dream angels of God were ascending and descending on it (Gen. 28:12). For the angels 
who had accompanied him from his father's house went up to heaven to announce to the 
angels on high: Come and see Jacob the pious, whose image is fixed upon the Throne of 
Glory, the one you have longed to see." Then the rest of the holy angels of the Lord came 
down to look at him. That is why the angels went up and down the ladder, for they as- 
cended to see the face carved on the celestial throne, and they descended to see the face of 
Jacob as he slept, whose features were identical to those carved on high. 

In the dream Jacob heard the voice of God say, "You, too, Jacob, climb up the ladder." 
For God was trying to remind Jacob that he was an angel, and that the time had come for 
him to return to the heavenly realm. But Jacob said, "Master of the Universe, I am afraid 
that if I climb up I will have to come down." Nor did he ascend on high. Indeed, it is said 
that if Jacob had climbed up the ladder, he would not have had to come down again, and 
Israel would have been spared great suffering. 

Thus when Jacob wrestled with the angel at the River Yabbok, the struggle was not 
that of a man and angel, but that of two angels— Uriel and Israel. Some say that Uriel had 
been sent to remind Jacob of his divine origin, saying, "Know that you were once an 
angel, who descended to earth and took up dwelling among humans and your name 
became Jacob. Now your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel" (Gen. 32:29). Others 
say that Uriel wrestled with Jacob, saying, "My name will take precedence over your 
name and the names of every other angel." At first Jacob did not understand, but sud- 
denly he remembered that he once was an angel. And Jacob said, "Are you not Uriel? 
Have you forgotten that I am Israel, the chief commander among the heavenly hosts?" 
And Jacob called out God's secret Name and thus defeated him. 

Still others insist that Jacob did not become an angel until after his death; only then 
did he become an immortal angel. 

Sometime before or after his death, Jacob himself said, "For I who speak to you, I 
Jacob-Israel, am an angel of God and a ruling spirit, the first servant before the presence 
of God. It was God who gave me the name Israel, which means, 'the man who sees God,' 
because I am the firstborn of all living beings that God brought to life." 


Of the many theories about the meaning of Jacob's struggle with a mysterious fig- 
ure at the River Yabbok (Gen. 33:25-31), one of the most interesting is that Jacob was 



MYTHS OF JACOB 365 


not only wrestling with an angel, but that he himself was the angel Israel. This ex- 
plains why the angel with whom he wrestled tells Jacob Your name shall he called Jacob 
no more, but Israel (Gen. 32:29). This suggests that the reason the angel Uriel had been 
sent was to remind Jacob of his true identity as an angel, something he had apparently 
forgotten during his foray among humans. 

This myth grows out of an extensive, if somewhat obscure, tradition that identifies 
Jacob as an angel or some other kind of divine being. It is primarily found in magical 
and mystical literature, and in these texts Jacob's identity as the angel Israel some- 
times converges with that of the nation of Israel. Such identification grows first out of 
the fact that Jacob is also known as Israel. Thus, just as Abram became Abraham and 
Sarai became Sarah, so the angel with whom he wrestled announced to Jacob that his 
name would now be Israel. Of course, this is also the name of the nation of Israel. 
Thus the special traditions linked to Jacob may derive from this identification of man 
and nation. 

In addition, Jacob is often identified as the ideal man, who represents the human 
race (much as does Adam), and whose face appears on the divine throne (see Ezek. 
1:10, 1:26). Further, it is suggested several times that Jacob was made wholly of fire, 
and that his ability to withstand the power of the angel demonstrated his divine na- 
ture. Further evidence is found in Jacob's ability to cause Laban's flocks to bring forth 
streaked, speckled, and spotted young (Gen. 30:39). For this reason Midrash Tehillim 
interprets the verse You have made him little less than divine (Ps. 8:6) as referring to 
Jacob, "thereby proving that Jacob was less than God only in that he had not the power 
to put the breath of life into them" (Midrash Tehillim 8:6). 

Further, according to Midrash Tehillim 31:7, Jacob was said to have been one of the 
two to whom God revealed the time of redemption. The other was Daniel. (See Daniel 
10:14). Jacob's divine knowledge is said to have been revealed by his final words to 
his sons, where he says, "Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall befall 
you in the end of days" (Gen. 49:1). This phrase, "the end of days," became the primary 
term for the messianic era which was so eagerly awaited. In fact. Midrash Tehillim 14:7 
suggests that Jacob alone, among the patriarchs, will be invited to the feast of redemp- 
tion: "When the Lord brought His people out of captivity, then Jacob will exult , Israel 
will rejoice (Ps. 14:7). Of all the patriarchs, why is it that Jacob is named as rejoicing? R. 
Shimon ben Lakish answered: 'When the children of Israel sin, only Jacob in the Cave 
of Machpelah feels defiled. So when the gladness of redemption comes, Jacob will 
rejoice in it more than any of the other patriarchs. For he alone of the patriarchs will be 
called to the feast, as it is said. Listen to me, O Jacob, Israel, whom I have called (Isa. 48:12). 
What does 'Israel whom I have called' mean? It means Israel, who will be called to the 
feast.'" 

There is also a legend that Jacob is the man in the moon, which probably derives 
from the myth that Jacob's face appears on the divine throne. See Louis Ginzberg, 
Legends of the Jews, vol. 5, p. 305, note 248. See also the Wolfson article listed below. 

In identifying Jacob as the "first minister of the face of God," Jacob is given the role 
traditionally played by Metatron, the angel of the Presence. This is the only angel who 
is said to be permitted to see God face to face. It would seem likely that there were 
early mystical circles in which Jacob played a Metatron-like role as the primary angel. 
But all that remains of the evidence of these circles are pseudepigraphal fragments, 
especially the Prayer of Joseph . 

All of these traditions concern the divine origin or divine nature of Jacob. In some it 
appears that Jacob was originally the angel Israel (Prayer of Joseph), while others suggest 
that Jacob's soul made a heavenly journey through the palaces of heaven ("Blessed are 
you ... for you entered the palace above and remained alive." — Midrash Avkir). See "Jacob's 
Ascent on High," p. 361. Jacob is also identified as the human face that Ezekiel saw on 
the Divine Chariot (Merkavah) (Ezek. 1:10, 1:26). One reference, Targum Neophyti, says 
about Jacob that his "likeness is set upon the divine throne." A similar tradition is also 
found in Genesis Rabbah (68:12) where it is said about Jacob that "You are the one whose 



366 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


features are engraved on high." In the same source God is said to have shown Jacob a 
throne of three legs, and God said to him: "You are the third leg," i.e., Jacob is the third 
patriarch. 

The primary sources of this unusual interpretation of the account of Jacob wres- 
tling with the angel are two pseudepigraphical texts. Prayer of Joseph and The Ladder of 
Jacob. Prayer of Joseph, a fragment, begins: "I, Jacob, who am speaking to you, am also 
Israel, an angel of God." This fragment also recounts that "I am the firstborn of every 
living thing to whom God gives life." This suggests that Jacob was a kind of protohu- 
man, an Adam-like figure, or even something similar to the kabbalistic figure of Adam 
Kadmon, whose creation was said to have preceded that of the earthly Adam. 

While most texts link Jacob's face with the face carved on the throne on high, Pirkei 
de-Rabbi Eliezer 35 has the ministering angels say, "This is a face like the face of the 
holy beast on the Throne of Glory." This identifies of Jacob with one of the hayyot, the 
celestial beasts, who are said to reside in the highest heavens. Thus while most texts 
identify the face of Jacob with the mysterious human face on God's throne — a face 
that is intimately linked to God Himself— the text from Pirkei de-Rabbi El ie zer avoids 
this direct link with God. 

The identification of the angel with whom Jacob wrestles as Uriel also derives from 
Prayer of Joseph 1:5-9, which supplies the reason for the wrestling — jealousy on the 
part of Uriel: "He envied me and fought with me and wrestled with me, saying that 
his name and the name that is before every angel was to be above mine. I told him his 
name and what rank he held among the sons of God. 'Are you not Uriel, the eighth 
after me? And I, Israel, the archangel of the power of the Lord and the chief captain 
among the sons of God? Am I not Israel, the first minister before the face of God? I 
called upon my God by the ineffable Name.' " 

The model for an angelic descent into this world is found in the midrashim concem- 
ing Genesis 6, the Sons of God and the daughters of men. Here two angels, Shemhazai 
and Azazel, are said to have convinced God to let them descend to this world to demon- 
strate that they would not be swayed by the Yetzer ha-Ra, the Evil Inclination. See "The 
Star Maiden," p. 455. The fragment in Prayer of Joseph suggests a similar scenario, with 
the angel Israel having descended to earth to become the patriarch Jacob. 

The cult of Jacob worship extended beyond the Jews. It is a theme found in Gnostic 
and Manichean texts; in the latter, it is stated that "we worship the Lord Jacob, the angel." 

It is interesting to note that there is an apocryphal Christian tradition about Jesus 
being an angel. According to The Gospel of the Ebionites, Jesus was not begotten of God 
the Father, but was created as one of the archangels, and he rules over the angels and all 
the creatures of God (Epiphanius, Haer. 30.16.4f). See "Jacob the Divine," following.

471. JACOB THE DIVINE 

Jacob's image is engraved on God's Throne of Glory in the highest heaven, and when the 
children of Jacob are oppressed, God looks at the image of Jacob and is filled with pity for 



MYTHS OP JACOB 367 


them, as it is said, " Then I will remember my covenant with Jacob " (Lev. 26:42). Then God 
embraces and kisses the image of Jacob, for he was a partner with his Creator in every- 
thing, as it is said. Not like these is the portion of Jacob; for it is he who formed all things (Jer. 
10:16). That is why God tells his words to Jacob (Ps. 147:19). So too did God reveal the time 
of the redemption to Jacob alone. 

God said to his world: "My world. My world, who created you and who formed you? 
Jacob created you and Israel formed you, as it is said, ' Who created you , O Jacob , who formed 
you , O Israel (Isa. 43:1). 

For heaven and earth were only created for the sake of Jacob; indeed, everything was 
created only for the sake of Jacob. Behemoth was created only for the sake of Jacob, and 
Abraham was saved from the fiery furnace only for the sake of Jacob. And Abraham 
himself was only created for the sake of Jacob, for God foresaw that Jacob was destined to 
spring from Abraham and said, "He deserves to be saved for the sake of Jacob." 

Indeed, it will be Jacob, more than any other patriarch, who will rejoice in the gladness 
of redemption, as it is said, Jacob will exult , Israel will rejoice (Ps. 14:7). For he alone of the 
patriarchs will be invited to the messianic banquet that will take place in the time to come. 

So too was it whispered among the angels that not only was Jacob's image carved on 
God's Throne, but that the image of the sleeping Jacob was identical with that of the Lord 
of Hosts. That is why the angels ascended and descended the ladder, comparing the 
image on high with that below, and it was as if they were peering into a mirror. 

There are even those who insist that it is the image of Jacob himself who sits on God's 
Throne, and that this is the true meaning of the semblance of a human form (Ezek. 1:26) in 
Ezekiel's vision. So too does the verse Thus said Yahweh: " The heaven is My throne " (Isa. 
66:1) reveal that Jacob dwells in the highest firmament, Aravot, upon the divine throne. 

That is why, when He set up an altar there , and called it El-elohe-yisrael, Jacob declared to 
God: "You are God in the celestial spheres and I am god in the terrestrial sphere. For just 
as You create worlds, so too do I create worlds; just as You divide worlds, so too do I 
divide worlds." God replied, "Jacob, you are exceedingly precious in My sight, for I have 
set your image on My Throne, and by your name the angels praise Me and say, 'Blessed is 
Yahweh , the God of Israel (Ps. 41:14). Therefore, why do you not ascend?" And Jacob re- 
plied: "Shall I also be forced to descend?" And God replied: "Have no fear, My servant Jacob 
... I will deliver you from far away " (Jer. 30:10). 

There is a distinct process of divinization in which the biblical Jacob is transformed 
into an angel, or even a second power in heaven. Why was Jacob, among the patri- 
archs, selected for this role? First, and foremost, because of the name Israel, which 
was given to Jacob by the angel he wrestled with at the River Yabbok in Genesis 32:25- 
33. The name Israel is the same as that of the nation of Israel, and therefore anything 
attributed to Jacob/Israel reflects on the destiny of the people of Israel, who share his 
name. Further, Jacob was the father of the twelve sons who represent the twelve tribes 
of Israel. Thus, not only does Jacob's name Israel represent the nation, but his sons 
represent the tribes. The interlinked identities of the patriarch and the people have 
thus become entirely intertwined, and they share a common fate. It is also possible 
that Jacob's role as the third patriarch is a factor, as the number three in this kind of a 
series is frequently the most important. 

Another important factor in Jacob's elevation is the verse in Jeremiah 10:16 that 
seems to acknowledge Jacob's divinity: Not like these is the portion of Jacob; for it is He 
who formed all things , and Israel is His very own tribe: Lord of Hosts is His name. God's 
deep affection for Jacob is conveyed in Sodei Razayya 16d. The text here says "It is 
written in Sefer Hekhalot that the Holy One, blessed be He, embraces and kisses the 
image of Jacob." 

In addition, Jacob's encounter with the angel at the River Yabbok, in which the 
angel blessed him saying. You have striven with God and with men , and have prevailed 



368 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


(Gen. 32:29) created a direct link between Jacob and the divine, over whom he had 
prevailed. And if such a thing were possible, would this not mean that Jacob must 
have been some kind of divine figure after all, an angel, or even more than that? 

In addition to this biblical encounter, the primary focus of Jacob's elevation to a 
divine figure derives from two key rabbinic myths. One holds that Jacob's image was 
carved or engraved on God's heavenly throne. The other suggests that Jacob himself 
was an angel. The key to this process derives from the tradition, found in many early 
and diverse sources, that Jacob's image is to be found on God's Throne of Glory. 

This divinization of Jacob was the culmination of a process by which all of the 
patriarchs were increasingly perceived from a mythic and mystical perspective. It is 
stated in Genesis Rabbah (82:88) that "the patriarchs are God's Chariot," linking the 
patriarchs with God's throne, as portrayed in the vision of Ezekiel (Ezek. 1:26). But 
Jacob, because of his role as the father of the twelve tribes, and especially because his 
name is identical with that of the people of Israel, came to take on a role that can only 
be regarded as divine. In these myths Jacob did not usurp the role of God, but shared 
with God the role of Creator. 

The role of Jacob can be seen to be transformed in this series of Jacob myths. Here 
a step-by-step evolution of Jacob's role can be seen, although many of these traditions 
existed simultaneously. In some Jacob's soul merely ascends on high during his dream 
at Beth El, but in others he is described as an angel, the most prominent in heaven, 
and ultimately he is portrayed as a creator who forms all things, i.e., a secondary God, 
much as the angel Metatron is often described. The remaining evidence of this tradi- 
tion of Jacob the divine is now found in snatches of passages and in fragments such as 
Prayer of Joseph. 

The tradition that Jacob, alone among the patriarchs, will attend the great feast that 
takes place in the messianic era, grows out of the verse Jacob shall exult , Israel will 
rejoice (Ps. 14:7). In Midrash Tehillim on this verse from Psalms this point is emphati- 
cally made: "It is not written here, 'Abraham shall exult, Isaac shall rejoice,' but Jacob 
will exult , Israel will rejoice. " For more on Jacob's presence at this feast, see the note to 
"The Messianic Banquet," p. 508.

472. THE IMAGE OF JACOB CAST DOWN FROM HEAVEN 

Just before the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, the people grew desperate, for 
they knew that they had angered God, and that God would no longer protect them. "Please, 
God," they prayed, "If You cannot forgive us, forgive us for the merits of our ancestors." 

God replied: "You think, O Israel, that you may freely anger Me, because the image of 
Jacob is engraved on My Throne of Glory? Here, have it, it is thrown in your face!" And 
God cast down the glory of Israel from heaven, as it is said. Has cast down from heaven to 
earth the majesty of Israel (Lam. 2:1). 



MYTHS OF JACOB 369 


In its immediate context, this myth of the image of Jacob being cast down from 
heaven is meant to demonstrate God's irrevocable resolve to destroy the Temple in 
Jerusalem. At the same time, the underlying message of this myth clearly appears to 
be in opposition to the treatment of Jacob as a divine figure, making this a polemical 
myth. A parallel purpose is served by the myth in which Elisha ben Abuyah sees the 
angel Metatron seated on a throne in heaven and concludes that there are two powers 
in heaven. Both of these myths can be seen as representing the rabbinic reaction to 
those who they feel have carried their obsession with Jacob and Enoch too far. See "A 
Vision of Metatron," p. 174. 

Another hint of rabbinic ambiguity about Jacob can be found in Genesis Rabbah 
68:12, which interprets the ascending and descending of the angels in Genesis 28:12 in 
a highly ambiguous fashion. "Ascending and descending" are taken to mean that 
some of the angels were exalting him and others degrading, maligning, and accusing 
him. Since the views attributed to the angels are often a projection of rabbinic atti- 
tudes, here there is a subtle acknowledgement that some rabbis viewed Jacob — and, 
by association, the veneration of him — positively, while others maligned him, as in 
this myth of Jacob's image being cast down from heaven. 

Although the myth might be seen as one of despair, it also serves to protect the people 
of Israel, for otherwise the biblical verse Has cast down from heaven to earth the majesty of 
Israel (Lam. 2:1) could be understood as being a complete rejection of the people of 
Israel. But Jacob's name is also Israel, and this interpretation narrows the implications 
of the verse. In fact, this narrowing is confirmed in Lamentations Rabbah 2:7, which, com- 
menting on the verse He has ravaged Jacob like flaming fire, consuming on all sides (Lam. 
2:3), says: "When punishment comes into the world, Jacob alone experiences it." 

There may also be a polemic here about the fall of Lucifer, which is found in 2 
Enoch (29:4-6): "But one from the order of archangels deviated, together with the divi- 
sion that was under his authority. He thought up the impossible idea, that he might 
place his throne higher than the clouds which are above the earth, and that he might 
become equal to My power. And I hurled him out from the height, together with his 
angels. And he was flying around in the air, ceaselessly, above the Bottomless." 

If this myth about Jacob's image being cast down from heaven was indeed a po- 
lemic, then Jacob is compared to an evil, fallen angel. This suggests the intensity of the 
opposition to the veneration of Jacob. Recognition of this conflict is suggested in Gen- 
esis Rabbah 68:12, where it is said that among the angels who ascended and descended, 
some exalted Jacob and others were degrading toward him, dancing, leaping, and 
maligning him.

473. THE DEATH OF JACOB 

Jacob lay on his deathbed. The twelve tribes of Israel were gathered together surround- 
ing his golden bed. Jacob said to his sons, "Purify yourself from uncleanliness, and I will 
tell you what will take place at the End of Days — the rewards of the righteous, the pun- 
ishments of the wicked, and the happiness of Eden." But as soon as the Glory of the 
Shekhinah was revealed, the time in which King Messiah was destined to come was hid- 
den from him, and the secrets could not be revealed. 



370 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


Here Jacob on his deathbed is about to reveal to his sons the secret God told him 
about when the End of Days would take place. But as soon as he glimpsed the pres- 
ence of the Shekhinah, his knowledge vanished.

474. JACOB NEVER DIED 

Everyone thought that Jacob had died. He had given his sons his final blessings, and it 
appeared that his soul had taken leave of this world. In fact, he was embalmed and bur- 
ied. But even though it appeared that he had died, Jacob was actually alive. Nor did he 
die after that. Indeed, Jacob never died. 

It is said that some of those at Jacob's funeral saw his eyes open once or twice, but they 
thought their own eyes had deceived them. Indeed, Jacob was present during the Exodus 
from Egypt, and he witnessed the crossing of the Red Sea and the drowning of Pharaoh's 
soldiers who chased after them. That is the meaning of the verse Israel saw the Egyptians 
dead on the shore of the sea (Exod 14:30). 

Likewise, Jacob witnessed the giving of the Torah, the ascent of Elijah, and Daniel's 
encounter with Bel. So too did he see the Temple built, destroyed, and rebuilt. 

Still others say that God's promise to Jacob, I will deliver you from far away ; your folk from 
their land of captivity (Jer. 30:10), meant that Jacob lives on in his seed, especially in those 
who make their home in the Holy Land. After all, Jacob was also Israel, and as long as the 
children of Israel still exist, Jacob will never die. 

One of the primary mythic motifs in Judaism concerns heroic figures who never 
die. Elijah's ascent in a fiery chariot (2 Kings 2:11) seems to have set this theme in 
motion. Others who are portrayed as having never died include Enoch, who walked 
with God, and he was no more; for God took him (Gen. 5:24). This ambiguous statement, 
rather than the expected, "and he died/' gave birth to a rich tradition about Enoch in 
which he was said to have been taken up into heaven and (in some versions) trans- 
formed into the angel Metatron. 

In addition, Abraham, Moses, and King David are often subjects of rabbinic leg- 
ends and folktales about appearances after their deaths. Although the deaths of all of 
them are clearly stated in the Bible, there are also some doubts associated with these 
accounts. Thus it says about Moses, And no one knows of his burial place to this day (Deut. 

34:6). Likewise, there is considerable doubt that King David is buried in his tomb on 
Mount Zion. 

The tradition that Jacob never died may derive from the memorable reply that 
Jacob's sons made to Joseph, when he asked them " How is your aged father of whom you 
spoke? Is he still in good health?" They replied, "He is yet alive" (Gen. 43:27-28). This phrase 
is often quoted as evidence that Jacob never died. 

Rashi offers another clue for Jacob's immortality in his interpretation of Genesis 
49:33, Breathing his last, he was gathered to his people. Rashi comments: "But 'dying' is 
not said of him since the word used was ' vayigva / 'expired/ rather than 'vayamot/ 
'dying/ Our rabbis of blessed memory said that this implies that 'our father Jacob did 
not die.'" Here Rashi quotes B. Ta'anit 5b, where Rabbi Yitzhak says, in the name of 
Rabbi Yohanan: “Ya’akov Avinu lo met— Our father Jacob did not die." 

Further, Jacob's immortality seems to be understood as linked to the people of 
Israel thus, as long as the people Israel thrive, Jacob is assured of immortality. This 
identification of the people Israel with Jacob is made explicit in Jeremiah 30:10: "There- 
fore fear not, O Jacob My servant said Yahweh. " Neither be dismayed, O Israel, For, lo, I will 
save you from afar" 



MYTHS OF JACOB 371 


Yet, while the immortality of Abraham, Moses, and King David is the subject of 
many legends and tales, Jacob's immortality exists more as an assertion than as the 
subject of a legendary narrative. Rather, it seems to be part of the divinization of Jacob, 
with immortality being one of the required characteristics of a divine figure. 

In Likutei Moharan 1:47 Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav interprets allegorically the state- 
ment in B. Ta'anit 5b that Jacob never died. Rabbi Nachman links Jacob to the holiness 
of the Land of Israel, which symbolizes eternal life. Therefore, Jacob did not really die, 
but lives eternally.

475. SUMMONING THE PATRIARCHS 

During the reign of Emperor Rudolf II, there lived among the Jews of Prague the great 
Rabbi Judah Loew, who was well versed in all of the mysteries and was a great master of 
the kabbalah. Now it happened that the emperor heard of Rabbi Loew's reputation and 
sent for him with a strange request: he wanted the rabbi to invoke the patriarchs Abraham, 
Isaac, and Jacob, and the sons of Jacob, to summon them from their graves. Rabbi Loew 
was appalled at this request, but when the emperor threatened the well-being of the Jews 
of Prague if he did not comply. Rabbi Loew agreed to attempt to do as he had asked. The 
rabbi warned the emperor, however, that under no circumstances must he laugh at what 
he saw, and the emperor promised that he would not. 

So it was that the day and place were fixed, and when Rabbi Loew and the emperor 
were alone in a secluded room of the castle. Rabbi Loew pronounced the spell that sum- 
moned the patriarchs and the sons of Jacob. And to the great amazement of the emperor, 
they appeared one after the other in their true form, and the emperor was amazed at the 
size and power of each of them, which far exceeded those of men in his own time. But 
when Naphtali, the son of Jacob, leaped with great ease over ears of com and stalks of 
flax in the vision, the emperor could not contain himself and began to laugh. Suddenly 
the apparitions vanished and the ceiling of that room began to descend and was on the 
verge of crushing the emperor when Rabbi Loew succeeded in making it halt with the 
help of smother spell. And it is told that the fallen ceiling can still be seen today in that 
room, which is kept locked. 

Numerous tales concerning Rabbi Judah Loew of Prague are to be found. The most 
famous of these concerns the creation of the golem, the man made out of clay, with 
which Rabbi Loew was said to have protected the Jewish community of Prague from 
a series of blood libels. But there are many other tales recounting the marvels of the 
Maharal, as Rabbi Loew was known. Many of these concern his use of powers deriv- 
ing from his knowledge of the Jewish mystical tradition, known as kabbalah. Only the 
purest and most eminent sages were considered capable of engaging in kabbalistic 
studies, and a great many stories are told of those who lost their sanity or even their 
lives by undertaking such studies without the proper background or preparation. Here 
the king is saved from destruction only because the pious Rabbi Loew is able to pre- 
vent the ceiling from collapsing. The magic of being able to invoke the presence of the 
patriarchs reflects the midrashic principle that the past is alive and that all genera- 
tions exist at the same time. The collapsing of the room in which the vision of the 



372 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


patriarchs takes place echoes the famous talmudic legend of Rabbi Eliezer ben 
Hyrcanus and other rabbis, who disagreed about a point of the Law. See "The Rabbis 
Overrule God," p. 67. 

Another, probably earlier, version of the summoning of a patriarch is found in 
Ma'aseh Nissim. This describes how Rabbi Lezer, a master of the Name, who lived in 
Worms, invoked King David's general Joab. Joab turned out to be of such great size 
that every step he took caused the house to shake and terrified the young men who 
observed the invocation, so they begged the rabbi to make him disappear, which he 
did. So frivolous was this use of the Ineffable Name, that in the version recounted in 
"Summoning the Patriarchs" it is the emperor who makes the demand, rather than 
the young Jewish students.

476. THE BIRTH OF MOSES 

Now Amram, the father of Moses, was a doctor able to cure everyone in Egypt. So great 
and exalted was he that he served Pharaoh himself, with the help of God. But there was 
a sorcerer, whose name was Pilti, who had read in the Book of Signs. From reading there 
he had learned of the coming birth of the child Moses, who would set free his people, the 
Jews, from oppression, while the kingdom of Egypt would suffer. This sorcerer reported 
to Pharaoh that he had seen the star of Israel ascending, while the destruction of Pharaoh's 
kingdom was growing near. And when Pharaoh heard this, he grew afraid, and he asked 
the sorcerer to tell him more of what he had seen. Then Pilti reported that he had seen the 
Apostle of the Jews cast into the sea, and he had also seen the people Israel cast into the 
sea, and the waters of the sea were parted by him who had not yet been born. 

Now when Pharaoh heard this he was filled with anger for forty days, and since the 
child had not yet been bom, he commanded that the men of Israel be prevented from 
approaching their wives, lest the child be conceived. Even Amram was forbidden to re- 
turn to his wife, and was forced to remain within the palace. But Pharaoh could not stand 
against the will of the Lord. One night a meeting was arranged between Amram and his 
wife, Jochebed, and from this meeting the child was begotten in the womb of his mother. 

Then the sorcerer Pilti returned to Pharaoh and told him that he had seen signs that 
the child had been conceived, despite the command of Pharaoh, for a star had revealed 
the child's future. Pharaoh grew angry and made a decree that every son bom to the 
Hebrews should be cast into the Nile, but that every daughter should be permitted to 
live. However the midwives feared the God of Israel, and secretly let the male children 
live. Therefore the people multiplied in number, and Pharaoh set himself against the 
Hebrews, who were growing powerful. 

Now when the time came for a daughter of Israel to give birth, she would go into the 
wilderness. If the child was a daughter, she would return with the girl child. But if it were 
a son, he was left in the wilderness, where God protected him, and suckled him with 
honey out of the rocks. And when the child had grown, he would return to his father's 
house. And all of these children had complete faith and trust in God, and never forgot 
how they were preserved. Then God remembered the covenant He had made with the 
pious, and in the seventh month the great prophet Moses was bom. And God told the 
Hosts of Heaven that he had been bom for whose sake God had created the world out of 
nothingness. 



MYTHS OF MOSES 373 


All the stars did obeisance to the infant Moses, for his light was the source of theirs. And 
it was known among all the children of Israel that the prophet of the Lord had been bom, 
the select of all creation. The master of signs had come, the master of covenants, the master 
of prayer, he who was to receive the holiest of all laws, the prophet of all generations. 

Here is a mythical birth of Moses from Sefer ha-Yashar, an unusual midrashic text 
that presents alternate versions of most of the primary biblical episodes. That the birth 
of Moses is prophesied based on an ascending star has a distinct echo of the birth of 
Jesus, and also echoes the midrashic account of the birth of Abraham, which may well 
draw on Christian sources. 

As presented here, the birth of Moses fulfills God's promise to the children of Is- 
rael that a redeemer would be bom. This is described as a universal event, involving 
all the stars, who bow down to the infant Moses. In fact, the kind of birth described in 
this myth strongly implies a kind of messianic role for Moses, who serves as a model 
for the concept of the Messiah. This shows that there was a Jewish tradition beyond 
that of the Samaritans in which Moses was viewed as a figure of messianic propor- 
tions beyond even the role of the redeemer that the Bible attributes to him.

Sefer ha-Yashar 67. 


477. AN ARK IN THE BULRUSHES 

Then Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, "Every boy that is bom you shall throw 
into the Nile, but let every girl live." 

A certain man of the house of Levi went and married a Levite woman. The woman 
conceived and bore a son; and when she saw how beautiful he was, she hid him for three 
months. When she could hide him no longer, she got a wicker basket for him and caulked it 
with bitumen and pitch. She put the child into it and placed it among the reeds by the bank of 
the Nile. And his sister stationed herself at a distance, to learn what would befall him. 

The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe in the Nile, while her maidens walked 
along the Nile. She spied the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to fetch it. 
When she opened it, she saw that it was a child, a boy crying. She took pity on it and said, 
"This must be a Hebrew child." Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go 
and get you a Hebrew nurse to suckle the child for you?" And Pharaoh's daughter an- 
swered, "Yes." So the girl went and called the child's mother. And Pharaoh's daughter 
said to her, "Take this child and nurse it for me, and I will pay your wages." So the 
woman took the child and nursed it. When the child grew up, she brought him to Pharaoh's 
daughter, who made him her son. She named him Moses, explaining, "I drew him out of 
the water." 

As Joseph Campbell notes in The Hero with a Thousand Faces , the birth of the hero is 
inevitably extraordinary. Faced with Pharaoh's decree ordering the death of all male 
Hebrew infants, Moses' mother placed him in an ark left floating in the bulrushes, 
well aware that the infant would be found, and hopefully raised, by an Egyptian fam- 
ily. That the one who finds him is the daughter of Pharaoh is an expression of his 
extraordinary fate. Note that this myth also provides an explanation for Moses' name, 
relating it to how he was found and drawn out of the water.

478. PHARAOH AND THE CHILD MOSES 

After the daughter of Pharaoh found the infant Moses in the bulrushes, she brought the 
child to live in the palace. There she told her father and his court that the Nile river had 
given her that child as a gift. So it was that they accepted the child, since it was the wish 
of the princess. But one of Pharaoh's sorcerers secretly believed that the child was a He- 
brew. And he waited for the chance to turn against him. 

One day, when Moses was three years old, he sat at the table on his mother's lap. Next 
to her sat Pharaoh, and to his right was Pharaoh's wife. Attracted by the glittering gems 
in Pharaoh's crown, the child Moses reached for the crown and knocked it off of Pharaoh's 
head. Then the evil sorcerer, who had been waiting for just such a moment, quickly said: 
"Do not ignore this sign from fate, my lord. For this child may be destined to usurp your 
throne." Pharaoh was filled with fear that this might have been such a sign. Therefore he 
called together all his advisors and asked their opinions. 

Now the angel Gabriel had been sent by God to guard the infant Moses at all times. 
And when the angel saw the danger the child faced, he disguised himself in the form of 
one of Pharaoh's advisers. And when Pharaoh asked them what they should do, he spoke 
and said: "Surely the child meant no evil. Why not give him a test to prove this? I suggest 
that two bowls be brought here. One of them will contain precious jewels and the other 
burning coals. If the child reaches for the jewels, this shows that he knows the coals are 
dangerous. For the coals will glow brighter than the jewels. That would prove that he is 
wise beyond his years. But if he reaches for the coals, that would prove that he has no 
more understanding than any other infant." 

Pharaoh quickly agreed to this test, for it seemed reasonable to him. And when the 
bowls had been brought and the infant Moses set down before them, the angel Gabriel 
made himself invisible and stood next to the child. Now as it happened Moses was at- 
tracted to the jewels rather than the burning coals, and would have reached for them. But 
as he did, the angel stopped his hand and made him reach for the coals instead. And 
before the child realized how hot the coals were, he had brought one to his tongue, singe- 
ing it. And when the child burst into tears. Pharaoh concluded that the child was com- 
pletely innocent. 

That is how the child Moses was able to remain within Pharaoh's palace until he was 
grown. But because he had singed his tongue, he always spoke with a bit of a stutter after 
that. And that is why he brought his brother, Aaron, to speak for him when the day came 
that he stood before Pharaoh and demanded that he let his people go. 

This is an extremely famous midrash that is often told to children. It explains how 
Moses got his stutter, as well as how Pharaoh decided to keep the infant Moses and 
raise him in the palace. This is, indeed, an appropriate midrash for children, who can 
easily understand why the bright jewel would be more attractive to an infant than a 
burning coal. It is possible that there were specific midrashim that were primarily 
intended for children. For other examples, see "The Giant Og," p. 461 and the com- 
mentary to "The Star Maiden," p. 455 about the angel's wings.

479. PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER 

Pharaoh's daughter, Bitiah, knew by divine inspiration that she was destined to raise the 
redeemer of Israel. That is why she strolled beside the Nile every morning and evening. 



MYTHS OF MOSES 375 


When she discovered Moses floating in an ark she knew that God had given her what she 
sought, and she rejoiced. How did she know? She saw that the infant was circumcised. 

Seeing that Bitiah wanted to save the infant, her attending maidens said to her, "Mis- 
tress, when a king issues a decree, even if the whole world does not fulfill it, at least his 
children should do so. Yet you transgress your father's decree." At that moment the an- 
gel Gabriel came and thrust them into the earth. 

Bitiah named the infant she drew out of the water Moses, and this remained his name 
for the rest of his life. 

God said to Bitiah, "Moses was not your son, yet you called him your son. Therefore, 
though you are not My daughter, I will call you My daughter." After that Bitiah went 
down to immerse herself in the river to cleanse herself from her father's idols, for the 
sake of converting to Judaism. 

At the request of Moses, Bitiah was not afflicted by any of the ten plagues, and was the 
only female firstborn to be spared in Egypt. She was one of the nine who entered Para- 
dise alive. There she was given her own heavenly palace, where she teaches Torah to the 
souls of righteous women. 

In the Midrash Pharaoh's daughter is given the name Bitiah, which means "daughter 
of God." She is regarded as a very holy figure, and is one of four righteous women 
who are said to have palaces of their own in heaven. The others are Serah bat Asher, 
Yocheved, the mother of Moses, and Deborah, the prophetess. See "Women in Para- 
dise," p. 190.

480. THE BURNING BUSH 

Now Moses, tending the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, drove the 
flock into the wilderness, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. An angel of the Lord 
appeared to him in a blazing fire out of a bush. He gazed, and there was a bush all aflame, 
yet the bush was not consumed. Moses said, "I must turn aside to look at this marvelous 
sight; why doesn't the bush bum up?" When the Lord saw that he had turned aside to 
look, God called to him out of the bush: "Moses! Moses!" He answered, "Here I am." 
And He said, "Do not come closer. Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on 
which you stand is holy ground. I am," He said, "the God of your father, the God of 
Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." And Moses hid his face, for he was 
afraid to look at God. 

The first encounter Moses has with God has many of the earmarks of a mystical 
vision. God speaks to Moses out of a bush that is burning but is not consumed. From 
this time on, the life of Moses is completely transformed, as many mystics have de- 
scribed their lives after having a mystical experience. However, in biblical terms what 
Moses experiences is not a personal vision, but the arrival of his true destiny, serving 
as the Redeemer of Israel. 

It may seem strange that God chose something as unimposing as a bush to reveal 
Himself, but there are other examples of God contracting Himself into a small space, 
such as the Ark. Later a kabbalistic principle, that of tzimtzum, would be established 
on this concept of contraction. See "The Contraction of God," p. 13. 

As with Abraham, God has chosen Moses, who starts out as a reluctant prophet, 
but in the end becomes the greatest prophetic figure of all. From this point on, God 
gives Moses explicit instructions about how to approach Pharaoh to demand that the 



376 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


Israelites, who were valuable slaves, should be set free and permitted to depart from 
Egypt. Likewise, God instructs Moses in how to approach the people of Israel, who 
are slow to acknowledge Moses as their leader. 

In subsequent encounters, Moses speaks directly to God, sees Him face to face, and 
receives the Torah, God's most precious gift, for Israel. All of these events are prefaced 
by this first revelation at the burning bush.

Exodus 3:1-6. 


481. MOSES SWALLOWED BY A SERPENT 

At a night encampment on the way , Yahweh encountered Moses and sought to kill him (Exod. 4:24). 
Why did God seek to kill him? Because of his son, Gershom, who had not been circumcised 
since Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, had not allowed Moses to circumcise him. 

Some say that God sent the angel Uriel in the guise of a giant serpent, who came and 
swallowed Moses from his head to the place of his circumcision. When Zipporah saw 
this, she understood that Moses had been attacked because their son had not been cir- 
cumcised. So Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son's foreskin, and touched his legs with it , 
saying , "You are truly a bridegroom of blood to me!" And when He let him alone , she added , "A 
bridegroom of blood because of the circumcision" (Exod. 4:25-26). 

Others say that God sent two angels, Af and Hemah, the Angels of Anger and Fury, 
after Moses. Hemah swallowed him, except for his legs. Only after Zipporah circumcised 
their son did Hemah spit him out. Then Moses sought to slay the destroying angels, as it 
is said. Give up anger , abandon fury (Ps. 37:8). 

Still others say that Zipporah knew by divine inspiration that in order to save Moses 
she must circumcise her son. Then she did not hesitate, but took the flint and cut off her 
son's foreskin (Exod. 4:25) and cast the foreskin at the feet of the Destroyer, saying, "May 
the blood of this circumcision atone for my husband." After that the Destroyer left him 
alone. Then Zipporah said, "How beloved is the blood that has delivered this bride- 
groom from the hand of the Angel of Death." 

The account of how God sought to kill Moses in Exodus 4:24 has always been con- 
sidered perplexing. Many biblical scholars believe the passage is fragmentary. Espe- 
cially oblique are Zipporah's comments about Moses being "a bridegroom of blood" 
to her. The rabbinic explanation is that Moses had not circumcised his son Gershom at 
the proper time and therefore God sent an angel in the form of a serpent who swal- 
lowed Moses from his head to the place of his circumcision. Seeing this, Zipporah 
understood that God's anger concerned their failure to circumcise the child. Thus she 
picked up a flint and circumcised the child on the spot, and the attack on Moses came 
to an end. Rashi says: "She was now sure of the cause of his illness, and realized that 
circumcision had saved his life." 

Zipporah's comment, from Targum Neophyti on Exodus 4:26, "How beloved is the 
blood that has delivered this bridegroom from the hand of the Angel of Death," is a 
perfect example of how the Targum changed the meaning of biblical texts by interpo- 
lating additional words into them. Here it is the verse You are truly a bridegroom of blood 
(Exod. 4:25), that serves as the basis of this interpolation. This transforms an enig- 
matic and fragmentary text into an assured and complete blessing. 

The two angels, Af and Hemah, are the personifications of Anger and Fury. Af is a 
male — and Hemah is a female — destroying angel. These furies resemble the Furies of 
Greek myth. Hemah's role is derived from Proverbs 16:14: The king's wrath (Hemah) is 
a messenger of death, Af and Hemah go forth together, like Samael and Lilith, and they 
are paired— and cursed— in Psalms 37:8: Give up anger, abandon fury. Through them 
God expresses his anger at Moses for not having circumcised his son. In general, there 



MYTHS OF MOSES 377 


are five great destroying angels: in addition to Af and Hemah, they are Ketzeph (Dis- 
pleasure), Hashmed (Destruction), and Hashbeth (Annihilation). These angels of de- 
struction can only be stopped by calling upon the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and 
Jacob ( Exodus Kabbah 44:8 and Ecclesiastes Kabbah 4:3). 

Note that this attack on Moses comes right after God had told him about the slay- 
ing of the firstborn of Egypt, and here he is almost slain because of his own firstborn. 
There seems to be some kind of link, but because of the truncated nature of Exodus 
4:24-26 it is difficult to ascertain exactly what it is. 

Why was the son of Moses not circumcised? Some sources put the blame on Jethro, 
Zipporah's father, others on Moses. Jethro is said to have ordered Moses not to cir- 
cumcise the baby at the time that he agreed to let Moses marry Zipporah. Moses prom- 
ised Jethro that he would not do so, and therefore he could not break his vow. Note 
that it is Zipporah, and not Moses, who does the act of circumcision.

482. SERAH BAT ASHER 

Serah bat Asher was the daughter of Asher, one of the sons of Jacob. She was among the 
sixty-nine who ascended with Jacob to Egypt, and she was among those who crossed the 
Red Sea and were counted by Moses in the census of the wilderness. 

Serah was still a child when Joseph's brothers asked her to sing a little song for her 
grandfather, Jacob. For Joseph had sent his brothers to bring the House of Jacob to Egypt, 
because of the famine in the land. Then Joseph's brothers had to find a way to break the 
news to Jacob that Joseph was still alive. They said, "If we tell our Father that Joseph is 
alive, he might die from the shock." And they decided to have Serah play the harp for 
Jacob and sing the words "Joseph is alive." This Serah gladly did, and when Jacob, who 
was lost in a reverie, suddenly understood what she was saying, he cried out, "Is it true?" 
And when Serah assured him that it was, Jacob, in his joy, gave her a great blessing, 
which let her live so long. 

But there is another version of this account, in which Jacob was furious that Serah had 
mentioned this most painful episode in his life, the loss of his son Joseph. And Jacob 
jumped up and pointed to her and said, "You should live so long!" And she did. 

The name Serah bat Asher appears in the Torah only twice, in two lists. Nothing 
else is said about her. Yet, using the midrashic method, the ancient rabbis were able to 
create a full identity for her and make her play an essential role in many key biblical 
episodes. They concluded that she lived longer than anyone else, even Methuselah. It 
was she who, knowing the sign, identified Moses as the Redeemer; she who helped 
Moses search for the coffin of Joseph; she who crossed the Red Sea and later reported 
on what the walls of the Red Sea looked like. This figure, Serah bat Asher, comes to 
life in the Talmud and the Midrash and becomes one of the favorite figures of the 
rabbis, whom they draw into the narrative as often as possible. How they did this is 
an object lesson in the midrashic method. 

Serah is also used to resolve another apparent contradiction. Genesis 46:27 states 
that the total of Jacob's household who came to Egypt was 70 persons. However, those listed in 
Genesis 46:8-25 only total 69. The explanation given in Genesis Kabbah 94:9 is that Serah 
bat Asher was counted twice. Because of her extreme righteousness and wisdom, she 
had the value of two. Other sources say that God came with them as the seventieth. 

The story of Serah bat Asher begins with a name in the list in the passage describ- 
ing Jacob's journey into Egypt: Jacob and all his offspring with him came to Egypt. He 



378 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


brought with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons , his daughters and granddaughters— all 
his offspring (Gen. 46:6-7). Among the 69 who accompanied Jacob into Egypt were, as 
recounted in Genesis 46:17: Asher's sons: Imnah, Ishvi, and Beriah, and their sister Serah. 
Serah might have remained merely a name in this list if not for a curious parallel. For 
in another list, in Numbers 26:46, that of the census taken by Moses in the wilderness 
the name Serah bat Asher appears again: The name of Asher's daughter was Serah. 

What are we to make of the fact that the same name appears in two lists separated by 
at least 200 years? From our perspective, it might be discounted as a coincidence. After 
all, Asher was a respectable name, and it is certainly possible that someone named Asher 
might name his daughter Serah. But from the point of view of the ancient rabbis, the fact 
that these two lists had this one name in common cried out for explanation. So they 
arrived at what was for them the logical conclusion: they were the same person. 

That resolves the problem of the identity of the two Serahs, but it doesn't explain 
how she lived so long. However, rabbinic ingenuity found a solution for this problem 
as well. Using the midrashic method, the rabbis searched for the "right place." This is 
the place in the text that gives the necessary clue, making it possible to read between 
the lines. And in this case the clue involved another matter that is missing in the 
biblical narrative: how the sons of Jacob finally informed him that his beloved son, 
Joseph, was not dead after all. 

It all goes back to the brothers' discovery that Joseph was still alive. Indeed, he was 
none other than the Prince of Egypt. And now that Joseph had revealed his true iden- 
tity, he commanded his brothers to bring their father and the rest of the family to 
Egypt, for there was a famine in the land: " And you shall tell my father of all my glory in 
Egypt* an &amp; °f a M that you have seen , and you shall hasten and bring down my father hither" 
(Gen. 45:13). This must have presented a dilemma to Joseph's brothers, since they had 
cast him naked into a pit and then sold him into slavery and then told their father that 
he had been slain by a wild beast. Now they had to go back to their father, Jacob, a 
frail old man, and tell him that Joseph was alive after all. 

Reading between the lines, the rabbis intuited that the brothers were filled with 
guilt and remorse, as well as with fear that Jacob might die of shock when he heard 
the news. So they came up with the idea of letting Serah break the news to him. They 
asked Serah, who apparently was a child, to play the harp for Jacob and sing him a 
little song, with the words "Joseph is alive, Joseph is alive." Serah, of course, was glad 
to sing a song for her grandfather, and when Jacob realized what she was saying, he 
jumped up and asked, "Is it true?" And when she told him it was true, he blessed her 
with such a great blessing that she lived as long as she did! In this way the midrash 
brought Serah to life and explained how she lived for so long.

483. THE SECRET OF THE REDEEMER 

There was a secret sign that God had communicated to Abraham, the secret of the mys- 
tery of the Redeemer. Abraham, in turn, delivered the secret to Isaac, Isaac revealed it to 
Jacob, and Jacob shared it with Joseph. Joseph revealed the secret to his sons. And Asher, 
one of the sons of Jacob, shared the secret of the mystery of the Redeemer with his daugh- 
ter, Serah. It was understood that whoever came to deliver the children of Israel from 
Egypt and said these words would be the true deliverer, sent to them by the Lord. 



MYTHS OF MOSES 379 


During the long years of slavery in Egypt, Serah bat Asher was enslaved and forced to 
work in a mill. When the time came to be freed from slavery, it was Serah who identified 
Moses as the Redeemer. For when Moses and Aaron came to the elders of Israel and 
performed the signs in their sight, the elders sought out Serah bat Asher, and they said to 
her, " A certain man has come, and he has performed signs in our sight," and they de- 
scribed them. So too did he say, "7 have taken note of you" (Exod. 3:16). Serah said, "That is 
the sign that I learned from my father. Therefore he is the one who will redeem Israel." 
Then they knew that Moses would surely deliver them from the power of Pharaoh, and 
they believed him and bowed down and prostrated themselves, and recognized Moses 
as their Redeemer. 

In the secret message, " I have taken note of you" ( pakod pakadti), God is actually 
speaking to Moses, as found in Exodus 3:16: "Go and assemble the elders of Israel and say to 
them: Yahzveh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has appeared to me 
and said, 7 have taken note of you and of what is being done to you in Egypt/" Here God has 
Moses introduce himself to the elders of Israel in much the same way he introduced 
himself to Pharaoh — as the representative of God — coming to them with God's own 
words. What he says is confirmed by Serah, whose knowledge comes directly from her 
father, and, indirectly, from the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph.

484. THE COFFIN OF JOSEPH 

Before his death, Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying , " When God has taken notice of 
you , you shall carry up my bones from here" (Gen. 50:25). So when the time came to leave 
Egypt, Moses searched everywhere for Joseph's coffin, but no one remembered where it 
was. After Moses had tired himself out searching for it, he encountered Serah bat Asher, 
who was a survivor of the generation of Joseph. Serah said: "My lord Moses, why are you 
so downcast?" Moses replied: "For three days and nights I have been searching for Joseph's 
coffin and I cannot find it." She said to him: "Come with me and I will show you where 
it is." Moses said: "Who are you, and how do you know where the coffin can be found?" 
She said: "I am Serah bat Asher, and I know for I was present when the leaden coffin of 
Joseph was sunk into the Nile." She led him to a shore of the Nile and there she said: "In 
this place the Egyptian magicians and astrologers made a metal coffin for Joseph and 
sank it into the river Nile, so that its waters should be blessed. Then they returned to 
Pharaoh and said: 'If it is your wish that these people should never leave this place, then 
as long as they do not find the bones of Joseph, they will be unable to leave.'" 

Some say that Moses then leaned over the bank of the Nile and called out: "Joseph, 
Joseph, we are leaving Egypt. The time has come for God to redeem His children, and for 
the oath you imposed on Israel to be fulfilled. I call on you to appear before me, and I will 
take your bones to the land of Canaan. If you will show yourself, well and good; if not, 
behold, we are free of your oath." At that moment Joseph's heavy lead coffin shook itself 
free, rose up from the depths, and floated on the surface, and Moses took it and carried it 
with him. 

Others say that Moses took a shard, wrote God's Name upon it, and threw the shard 
into the river. At once Joseph's coffin floated up to the surface. 

All the years that the Israelites were in the wilderness there were two arks that accom- 
panied the children of Israel in their wandering, the one containing the remains of Jo- 
seph, as it is said. And Moses took with him the bones of Joseph (Exod. 13:19), and the other 



380 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


the Ark of the Tabernacle. The one represented the past and the other, the Torah, defined 
the future. 

At the end of Genesis, Joseph, surrounded by his brothers, takes a vow of the fu- 
ture generations: "I am about to die. God will surely take notice of you and bring you up from 
this land to the land that He promised on oath to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob." So Joseph 
made the sons of Israel swear , saying , "When God has taken notice of you , you shall carry up 
my bones from here . " Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years; and he was em- 
balmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt (Gen. 50:24-26). This coffin, according to Mekhilta 
de-Rabbi Ishmael , was sunk in the middle of the Nile. Later it is reported in Exodus 
14:19 that Joseph's coffin was carried next to the Ark of the Tabernacle. This raised the 
question of how the coffin was found, which is answered in this myth. 

In leading Moses to the place where Joseph's coffin was lowered into the Nile, 

Serah bat Asher performs her most important task. This midrash fills in a major gap in 
the biblical narrative between the vow that Joseph made the sons of Israel swear on 
his deathbed that you shall carry my bones from here (Gen. 50:25) and the report that 
Moses took the bones of Joseph with him (Exod. 14:19). However, it is Moses who must 
figure a way to raise up the sunken coffin. In one version of the myth, he calls out to 
Joseph, saying, "If you make yourself visible, well and good. If not, we shall be inno- 
cent of violating the oath you made our forefathers swear" ( Pesikta de-Rav Kahana). 

Thus, if Moses is unable to raise up the coffin, he will at least have done his best to 
fulfill the oath. 

One of the miracles of the recovery of Joseph's coffin is that it was made of metal. 

B. Sota 13a addresses this issue: "Be not astonished that iron should float," and fol- 
lows with an example (from 2 Kings 6:5-7) of how an axe-head was made to float. 

B. Sota and Pesikta de-Rav Kahana recount a dialogue with a passerby who saw the 
two caskets Israel carried in the desert, one the coffin of Joseph and the other contain- 
ing the tablets of the Law. "What are these two caskets?" They answered, "One is the 
ark of Joseph, who was mortal, and the other is the Ark of Him who is immortal." The 
passerby asked, "Is it proper that God's Ark should accompany an ark with a man in 
it?" They answered, "This one contains the bones of Joseph, who fulfilled all the com- 
mands that God set down in the other Ark."

485. A VISION AT THE RED SEA 

When Serah bat Asher was among the children of Israel at the Red Sea, she had a vision 
in which she saw things that none of the others saw. In the vision she saw the multitude 
of angels who had gathered to watch the children of Israel cross the Red Sea. So too did 
she see the Divine Presence, who descended among them when Miriam played the tam- 
bourine and sang the Song of the Sea. And in that vision Serah even saw the Holy One 
commanding the waters of the Red Sea to part. For other than Moses, Serah was the only 
one alive in that generation who could look upon the Holy One and live. 

There are contradictory traditions about what the Israelites saw at the Red Sea. 

Some state that a maidservant saw at the sea what Isaiah and Ezekiel and all the 
prophets never saw, as it is said. The heavens were opened and I saw visions of God (Ezek. 

1:1). Regarding Serah's position as a maidservant, Pesikta de-Rav Kahana recounts that 
upon coming down into Egypt, Serah was enslaved and compelled to bend over a 
mill in forced labor.

See the following myth of "The Walls of the Red Sea," where Serah reports on what 
she witnessed.

Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, Shirata 3:28-39; Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 7:6/9. 


486. THE WALLS OF THE RED SEA 

Rabbi Yohanan once asked his students to describe the appearance of the walls of the Red 
Sea when the waters parted for the children of Israel to cross. When none could do so. 
Rabbi Yohanan described them as resembling a window lattice. Then, all at once, they 
heard a voice say: "No, it was not like that at all!" And when they looked up, they saw the 
face of a very old woman peering in the window of the house of study. "Who are you?" 
demanded Rabbi Yohanan. "I am Serah bat Asher," came the reply, "and I know exactly 
what the walls resembled. I was there, I crossed the Red Sea — and they resembled shin- 
ing mirrors, mirrors in which every man, woman, and child was reflected, so that it seemed 
like an even greater multitude crossed there, not only those of the present, but also those 
of the past and future as well." And when Serah had finished speaking, none dared con- 
tradict her, for her knowledge was firsthand. 

Here is one more example of a midrash in which Serah bat Asher, by this time more 
than a thousand years old, suddenly appears to resolve a question about the Exodus. 

Her explanations are definitive for, as she notes, "I was there." As for the reason that 
the walls shone, Pesikta de-Rav Kahana suggests it was because such personages as 
Moses and Aaron, who had drunk deep of Torah's waters, made the waters shine.

487. THE DEATH OF SERAH BAT ASHER 

How long did Serah live? Some say she lived until the days of the Temple, while others 
say she lived even longer than that. One account has it that she met her death in the ninth 
century in a fire in a synagogue in Isfahan. And when that synagogue was rebuilt it was 
named the Synagogue of Serah bat Asher, and the Jews of Persia made pilgrimages to 
that synagogue, the holiest Jewish site in the land. 

Others say that Serah bat Asher never died. She was taken to the heavenly Garden of 
Eden while she was still alive, because she had announced to Jacob that Joseph was alive. 
There Serah has a palace of her own, where she teaches Torah to the righteous women. 
And they know that every word she says is true, because she was a witness to all the 
miracles that took place in those mighty days. 

There are two legendary accounts of the ultimate fate of Serah. One reports that 
she met her death in a fire in a synagogue in Isfahan, Persia, in the ninth century. That 
synagogue was rebuilt and named after her, and it is still the holiest Jewish site in 
Iran, to which Persian Jews used to make pilgrimages when they were still permitted 
to do so. 

However, it is also said that Serah never died, but that she was taken into Paradise 
alive because she brought Jacob the news that Joseph was still alive (Gen. 45:26). She 
is counted among the nine who entered Paradise alive ( Derekh Eretz Zuta 1), and it is 
said that she now is one of the blessed women who teaches Torah to the souls of 
righteous women in a heavenly palace of her own (Zohar 3:167a-b). See "Women in 
Paradise," p. 190. 



382 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


As this rich legend of Serah bat Asher makes abundantly clear, it is the latter ver- 
sion that rings true. Serah never died. She was created out of the imagination of the 
rabbis and she lives on, a living witness to God's miracles during the Exodus who 
wanders the world, setting things straight.

488. GOD'S FOOTSTOOL 

The Egyptian taskmasters beat the Israelites so that they would make bricks for them. As 
the Israelites were treading the straw in the mortar, along with their wives and sons, the 
straw pierced their heels, and the blood mingled with the mortar. A young woman named 
Rachel, who was near childbirth, was treading the mortar, and the child was bom there 
and became entangled in the clay and brick. Her cry ascended before the Throne of Glory, 
and the angel Gabriel came down and brought the brick into heaven, and set it as a 
footstool beneath God's throne. 

This myth recounts the suffering of the Israelites under Egyptian bondage, and 
how a newborn child was lost in the mortar and the angel Gabriel brought the brick 
into heaven as a footstool for God, which thus became a memorial of the bondage of 
the Israelites in Egypt. Targum Pseudo-Yonathan on Exodus 24:10 links this footstool 
with the sapphire stone under the feet of God in Exodus 24:10: And they saw the God of 
Israel; and there was under His feet the like of a paved work of sapphire stone.

489. THE PARTING OF THE RED SEA 

Then the Lord said to Moses, "Why do you cry out to Me? Tell the Israelites to go for- 
ward. And you lift up your rod and hold out your arm over the sea and split it, so that the 
Israelites may march into the sea on dry ground. And I will stiffen the hearts of the Egyp- 
tians so that they go in after them; and I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his 
warriors, his chariots and his horsemen. Let the Egyptians know that I am Lord, when I 
gain glory through Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen." 

The angel of God, who had been going ahead of the Israelite army, now moved and 
followed behind them; and the pillar of cloud shifted from in front of them and took up 
a place behind them, and it came between the army of the Egyptians and the army of 
Israel. Thus there was the cloud with the darkness, and it cast a spell upon the night, so 
that the one could not come near the other all through the night. 

Then Moses held out his arm over the sea and the Lord drove back the sea with a 
strong east wind all that night, and turned the sea into dry ground. The waters were split, 
and the Israelites went into the sea on dry ground, the waters forming a wall for them on 
their right and on their left. The Egyptians came in pursuit after them into the sea, all of 
Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and horsemen. At the morning watch, the Lord looked down 
upon the Egyptian army from a pillar of fire and cloud, and threw the Egyptian army 
into panic. He locked the wheels of their chariots so that they moved forward with diffi- 
culty. And the Egyptians said, "Let us flee from the Israelites, for the Lord is fighting for 
them against Egypt." 



MYTHS OF MOSES 383 


Then the Lord said to Moses, "Hold out your arm over the sea, that the waters may 
come back upon the Egyptians and upon their chariots and upon their horsemen." Moses 
held out his arm over the sea, and at daybreak the sea returned to its normal state, and 
the Egyptians fled at its approach. But the Lord hurled the Egyptians into the sea. The 
waters turned back and covered the chariots and the horsemen — Pharaoh's entire army 
that followed them into the sea; not one of them remained. But the Israelites had marched 
through the sea on dry ground, the waters forming a wall for them on their right and on 
their left. 

Thus the Lord delivered Israel that day from the Egyptians. Israel saw the Egyptians 
dead on the shore of the sea. And when Israel saw the wondrous power that the Lord had 
wielded against the Egyptians, the people feared the Lord; they had faith in the Lord and 
His servant Moses. 

The parting of the Red Sea is universally regarded as the greatest Jewish miracle of 
all time. Belief that the parting of the sea had really taken place was used as a test of 
faith. For example, a widow in Safed was said to have been possessed by a dybbuk 
because she did not believe that the waters of the sea had really parted. See "The 
Widow of Safed," p. 228. 

Rabbinic lore is full of descriptions of what the walls of the Red Sea looked like 
when they parted, how they contained foods such as pomegranates for those who 
became hungry while crossing, etc. According to Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, be-Shalah 
4:87-97, the splitting of the Red Sea was a great revelation, in which the slave girls saw 
great things that even the prophet Ezekiel did not see. The widespread experience of 
this revelation serves the purpose of validating the account. See also "The Walls of the 
Red Sea" p. 381, where Serah bat Asher serves as a witness who had experienced this 
miracle firsthand. 

According to Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 42, when the Red Sea split, it split into twelve 
paths, one for each of the 12 tribes.

490. THE WATERS OF THE RED SEA REFUSE TO PART 

Moses stretched his hand over the Red Sea as God had told him to do. When the sea saw 
this, it said, "Why should I divide my waters?" Moses answered, "The Lord sent me to 
do this thing." But the waters refused to be divided. 

Then Moses lifted up his staff, with which he had performed miracles in Pharaoh's court, 
and he said to the sea, "Behold the staff of God which is in my hand and do what the Lord 
has commanded you to do." But the sea was stubborn and refused to be divided. 

Then the splendor and majesty of the Lord appeared. And when the sea saw the Lord, 
it fled before Him. 

Moses said to the sea, "You did not hearken to me until now. Why have you fled 
before me?" And the sea answered, "I have not fled before you, Moses, but before the 
Lord, the Creator of the world." 

This myth echoes, and was likely inspired by, midrashic accounts of the reluctance 
of the upper waters to separate from the lower waters when God created a firmament 
between them. See "The Upper Waters and the Lower Waters," p. 104. Here the waters 
of the Red Sea refuse to part at the command of Moses, but when God appears they 
quickly do as they were told. The underlying meaning of this midrash may be that it 
was not Moses who accomplished the miracles associated with the Exodus, but God, 



384 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


whose power stood behind everything that Moses did. This interpretation follows 
rabbinic concern that Moses might be deemed a messianic figure and raised up to 
divine proportions. The rabbis may have been trying to avoid the kind of Moses fixa- 
tion found among the Samaritans. To counter this, Moses was left almost entirely out 
of the Haggadah, despite his central role in freeing the people from Egypt, receiving 
the Torah, and leading them to the Holy Land.

491. CROSSING THE RED SEA 

When the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, God saw to it that everything they needed 
was to be found in the waters. The women followed their husbands, carrying their in- 
fants in their arms, and when the children cried, they plucked apples and pomegranates 
from the sea, and gave them to the crying children, and they ceased to weep. 

This is a delightful myth that assures us that God supplied everything the people 
needed while they were crossing the Red Sea, including food for hungry children. 

This is part of a series of myths about God's concern with the people during the Exo- 
dus. Not only did God supply manna, which tasted like whatever food they wanted 
most, but a wandering well that followed them, and clouds of glory to protect them 
from above and below. See "The Manna," p. 479, "Miriam's Well," p. 387, and "The 
Seven Clouds of Glory," p. 392.

492. MOUNT MORIAH AND THE RED SEA 

At the very moment that the children of Israel went into the Red Sea, Mount Moriah 
began to move from its place, along with the altar for Isaac that had been built upon it. 
The whole scene had been arranged before the creation of the world. Isaac was bound 
and placed upon the altar; Abraham's knife was raised. 

Far away, at the Red Sea, God said to Moses, "Moses, Moses, My children are in dis- 
tress, the sea is blocking their path and the enemy is pursuing them, and you stand so 
long praying? 

Moses said before God, "What should I be doing?" 

God said, "Raise up your staff!" 

Moses lifted up his staff, the waters of the Red Sea parted, and on Mount Moriah the 
voice of the angel went forth, "Do not raise your hand against the boy , or do anything to him " 
(Gen. 22: 12). 

This remarkable midrash from Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael is the clearest possible state- 
ment about the nature of midrashic time: there is no before or after; past, present, and 
future exist simultaneously. Thus the Binding of Isaac on Mount Moriah takes place at 
the same time as the parting of the waters of the Red Sea. But that is not all— the 
future event affects the past event. The powers of mercy generated by the parting of 
the Red Sea save Isaac at the very moment Abraham is about to sacrifice him. This is 
an astonishing view of timeless history, where future events can affect the past. 

A similar link between the Akedah, the binding of Isaac, and the parting of the Red 
Sea is found in Genesis Rabbah . Here, however, the influence is the exact opposite: the 



MYTHS OF MOSES 385 


merit that Abraham earned from the Akedah is applied at the Red Sea. As a reward for 
the wood Abraham cleaved for the burnt-offering, he earned that God should cleave 
the sea before his descendants, as it is said. The waters were split (Exod. 14:21). 

For more on the tradition that the Akedah was prepared before the creation of the 
world, see “Seven Things Created before the Creation," p. 74.

493. GOD'S PRESENCE AT THE RED SEA 

After Pharaoh passed a decree condemning all male children bom to Israelite mothers, 
many of the mothers who gave birth to boys abandoned them in an open field, for had 
they brought them home, not only the infants but all of the members of their family 
would have been slain. What happened to those babies? They were cared for by God 
Himself. 

When they were grown, they returned to their families. When they were asked who 
took care of them, they said, "A handsome young man took care of all our needs." And 
when the Israelites came to the Red Sea, those children were there, and when they saw 
God at the sea, they said to their parents, "That is the one who took care of us when we 
were in Egypt." That is why it is said that every single one of those who crossed the Red 
Sea could point with his finger and say. This is my God , and I will glorify Him (Exod. 15:2). 

Because of Pharaoh's decree, most male children bom to Israelite mothers were 
abandoned. Moses, of course, was raised by Pharaoh's daughter, but what happened 
to the others? This myth supplies a moving explanation, saying that God, described 
as "a handsome young man," took care of them. This offers a view of a nurturing God, 
much as is found in the myth about "God and the Spirits of the Unborn," p. 140 or in 
"The Dew of Resurrection," p. 504. The boys were able to return to their families once 
they were grown, since they were no longer infants to be identified by Pharaoh's hench- 
men. And they were able to identify that "young man" at the Red Sea, where God was 
present. 

Other myths describe God's appearance at the Red Sea as a mighty warrior. See 
"The Warrior God," p. 29. In commenting on these varying reports of God's appear- 
ance, Rashi quotes God as saying "Since I change in My appearance to the people, do 
not say that there are two divine beings" (on Exod. 20:2).

494. PHARAOH'S ARMY LURED TO ITS DEATH 

When the Egyptians reached the Red Sea, the waves of the sea took on the likeness of 
mares, and the wicked Egyptians took on the likeness of lustful stallions. The stallions 
chased the mares until they sank in the sea. That is the meaning of. Horse and driver He has 
hurled into the sea (Exod. 15:1). 

When the Egyptians were drowning in the Red Sea, the angels wished to sing a hymn 
in praise of God, but God silenced them, saying: "Do not sing today. How can I listen to 
singing when the works of My hands are drowning in the sea?" 



386 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


Some say that the angels sought to sing so loudly that the souls of the Egyptians would 
take leave of this world through the sweetness of their celestial melodies. But God said, 
"They have caused My children to perish. Should they die from the sweetness of your 
singing?" 


This is an important talmudic myth, which establishes God's caring for all his cre- 
ations, even those who are the enemies of his people, Israel. Here the angels want to 
celebrate the defeat of Pharaoh's army, but God rebukes them. Thus God suffers over 
the suffering of His creations. This myth is based on the much earlier biblical teach- 
ings in Proverbs 24:17 that if your enemy fails, do not exult. 

Rabbi Shmelke of Nikolsburg (1726-1778) suggests a different interpretation by sug- 
gesting that the purpose of the angels in wishing to sing was not to celebrate the deaths 
of the Egyptians, but to draw out their souls painlessly, and that it is God who objects to 
this idea, because it does not make them suffer for their sins. This, then, is a good ex- 
ample of how the midrashic method can reverse the meaning of a text entirely.

495. THE QUARREL OF THE SEA AND THE EARTH 

All of Pharaoh's army drowned in the Red Sea, as it is said. Horse and driver He has hurled 
into the sea (Exod. 15:1). Yet it is also recorded that The earth swallowed them (Exod. 15:12). 
How did this happen? The sea and the earth had a quarrel. The sea said to the earth, 
"Receive your children, as it is said. For dust you are and to dust you shall return " (Gen. 
3:19). And the earth said to the sea, "Receive your slain." For the sea did not want to sink 
them, and the earth did not want to swallow them. The earth was afraid to receive them, 
lest they testify against it on the Day of Great Judgment in the World to Come— just as 
Abel's blood did, as it is said, " Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground" (Gen. 
4:10). At that time God inclined His right hand over the earth and swore an oath that the 
bodies of the dead would not be permitted to testify against the earth in the World to 
Come. Then earth then opened its mouth and swallowed them. 

Still, God did not rejoice in the downfall of the wicked. When Pharaoh's army was 
drowning in the Red Sea, the ministering angels wanted to chant their hymns, but God 
said, "Shall you chant hymns while the work of My hands is being drowned in the sea?" 

This myth about a quarrel between the sea and the earth appears in Targum Pseudo- 
Yonathan on Exodus 15:12, and has been inserted to precede the verse The earth swal- 
lowed them (Exod. 15:12). It explains an apparent contradiction in the text, where 
Pharaoh's army drowns in the Red Sea, but the text says that the earth swallowed them 
(Exod. 15:12). The switch comes about when the sea calls upon the earth to accept the 
bodies of the drowned, since they were created from the dust of the earth to begin 
• with. Thus, in a legalistic manner, the sea requires the earth to fulfill the obligation 
inherent in For dust you are and to dust you shall return (Gen. 3:19). The earth's concern 
is also legalistic: it fears that the bodies of the dead might testify against it in the 
World to Come. But when God swears that the bodies will not testify against the earth, 
the earth "opened its mouth and swallowed them." For another example of a quarrel 
between elemental forces, see "The Quarrel of the Sun and the Moon," p. 112. 

There is a related myth about the drowning of Pharaoh's army in B. Megillah 10b 
that establishes God's caring for all his creations, even those who are the enemies of 
His people Israel. Here the angels want to celebrate the defeat of Pharaoh's army, but 



MYTHS OF MOSES 387 


God rebukes them. Thus God suffers over the suffering of His creations. See the pre- 
ceding myth, "Pharaoh's Army Lured to Its Death."

496. MIRIAM'S WELL 

During their forty years of wandering in the wilderness, an enchanted well gave the 
Israelites fresh water to drink. God gave them this well as a gift because of the merits of 
Miriam, the sister of Moses. It was there for them every day, whenever they were thirsty. 
How was this possible? It followed the Israelites everywhere they went. It ascended the 
high mountains with them, and it descended with them to the deep valleys, going around 
the entire camp of Israel and giving them drink, each and every one of them at the door 
of his tent. 

The enchanted well accompanied the children of Israel to the court of the Appointed 
Tent and stopped there. And the princes of the Congregation approached it, and said, 
"Come, O well, and give of your waters!" And the well gave forth water, and the Congre- 
gation and their cattle drank. 

Some say that well was created at the beginning of Creation, while others say that the 
patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, dug it. Then it was hidden until it was returned to 
the children of Israel by Moses and Aaron, who rediscovered it. 

Whatever became of Miriam's well? Some say it disappeared the day that Miriam 
died; others say it followed the people all the way to the Holy Land. Still others say that 
the well can still be found traveling from place to place, wherever Jews can be found. 
Whenever a minyan gathers, it is possible to drink from the well. 

The existence of Miriam's Well — a well that followed the Israelites through the 
wilderness, to provide them with fresh water — is suggested by Numbers 21:16-29, 
where the description of a well that God gives to the people is immediately followed 
by a list of places they traveled to, suggesting that the well traveled with them to 
these places. The well itself is identified as the one issued from the rock struck in 
Exodus 17:3-6. The well was said to have been given because of the merits of Miriam. 

For a folktale recounting a late encounter with Miriam's well, see "The Wandering 
Well" in Gabriel's Palace , pp. 250-251. See too "The Angel of Forgetfulness" in Gabriel's 
Palace , pp. 81-83, where the Ari restores the harmony of Hayim Vital by having him 
drink from Miriam's well. 

The fate of this miraculous well is disputed in various sources. Some say it disap- 
peared after Miriam's death, others that it was restored after a while because of the 
merits of Aaron and Moses, but taken away after the death of Moses. And a number of 
folktales describe it as still existing in the Sea of Galilee. 

There is also a metaphorical link in this myth between Miriam's well and the To- 
rah, which is also seen as an inexhaustible resource to quench a person's thirst for 
knowledge.

497. HOW MOSES SURVIVED 

How was it possible for Moses to survive on Mount Sinai for forty days and nights with- 
out food or water? Moses, and Moses alone, was able to achieve the exalted level of an 
angel, and therefore, during that period, he required no material sustenance. 

In at least one case in Jewish lore, that of the metamorphosis of Enoch into Metatron, 
a human is transformed into an angel. Here Moses does not exactly become an angel, 
but rather becomes as exalted as an angel, therefore requiring no food or water, since 
angels do not eat or drink. See "The Metamorphosis and Enthronement of Enoch," p. 

156.

Makhon Siftei Tzaddikim on Genesis 1:16. 


498. THE ENTHRONEMENT OF MOSES 

God honored Moses and gave him all of the earth and sea, and all the rivers and all the 
other elements. He gave him all the world as a possession suitable for His heir, for Moses 
was named God and King of the whole nation. So too did Moses enter into the darkness 
where God was, perceiving things invisible to mortal nature. There he dwelt in the mys- 
teries until he was crowned with light, wearing a robe of light, his face clothed in a beam 
of light. 

When Moses reached the peak of Mount Sinai he saw a throne so large that it touched 
the clouds of heaven. On it sat a man of noble bearing, wearing a crown, with a scepter in 
one hand. With the other hand He beckoned Moses, who approached and stood before the 
throne. The man on the throne then handed over the scepter to Moses and beckoned for 
him to mount the throne, and gave Moses a crown of light. Then that man withdrew from 
the throne. And Moses sat on the great throne and wrote what his Lord had taught him. 

Just as there are enthronement myths about Adam, Enoch, Jacob, and King David, 
this myth describes the enthronement of Moses. For Philo the role attributed to Moses 
transcended that of a prophet and came closer to that of a messianic or divine figure. 

In this astonishing myth, Moses is invited to take the place of the enthroned figure 
who clearly seems to represent God, although this figure might be identified with the 
Glory of the Lord, which Ezekiel describes as that of a human form seated upon a 
throne: Above the expanse over their heads was the semblance of a throne, in appearance like 
sapphire ; and on top , upon this semblance of a throne, there was the semblance of a human form 
(Ezek. 1:26-28). A similar enthronement of Adam is described in The Testament of 
Abraham . See "The Enthronement of Adam," p. 131. 

Here Philo describes Moses in terms that elevate him from a human hero to one 
who is virtually divine, while Ezekiel the Tragedian describes the actual enthronement 
of Moses. At the end of the enthronement, it seems as if God turns over His scepter 
and His throne to Moses and withdraws. The other primary sources for this myth are 
found in the Samaritan text Memar Markah and Samaritan hymns. The Samaritans, a 
Palestinian sect closely related to Judaism, regarded Moses as an elevated, near-mes- 
sianic figure, and it is not surprising that Samaritan texts sometimes stray into the 
realm of elevating Moses to a godly status. 

The surprising description of Moses as God and King echoes Exodus 7:1: "See, I 
place you in the role of God to Pharaoh ."

499. MOSES TRANSFORMED INTO FIRE 

God said to Moses, "I will bring you up to My Throne of Glory, and I will show you the 
angels of heaven." Then God commanded Metatron, the Prince of the Presence, "Go and 
bring Moses into heaven." But Metatron replied, "Master of the Universe, Moses cannot 
ascend to heaven because the angels consist of fire, but he is only flesh and blood." God 
said, "Go and change his body into fire." 

So Metatron went to Moses, and Moses trembled with fear when he saw him. "Who 
are you?" Moses asked. Metatron replied, "I am Enoch, son of Jared. God has sent me to 
bring you to His Throne of Glory." Moses said, "I am only flesh and blood and cannot 
look upon the angels." 

Then Metatron changed Moses' tongue into a fiery tongue, and he made his eyes like 
wheels of the Divine Chariot, and he gave him the powers of the angels and brought him 
into heaven. 

Here the ruling angel Metatron transforms Moses into fire just as Metatron himself 
was once transformed from being the human Enoch. The implication is that Moses 
will now take the place of Metatron as the chief among the angels. This myth must be 
seen in the context of those Jews (and Samaritans) for whom Moses was viewed as a 
messianic figure. In this myth Moses is raised even higher than that, and therefore 
this must be regarded as an enthronement myth about Moses, just as such myths are 
found about Adam, Enoch, Jacob, and King David. See "The Enthronement of Moses," 
p. 388 for another example of an enthronement myth about Moses.

500. THE DIVINE RADIANCE 

So Moses came down from Mount Sinai. And as Moses came down from the mountain 
bearing the two tablets of the Pact, Moses was not aware that the skin of his face was 
radiant, since he had spoken with God. Aaron and all the Israelites saw that the skin of 
Moses' face was radiant; and they shrank from coming near him. But Moses called to 
them, and Aaron and all the chieftains in the assembly returned to him, and Moses spoke 
to them. Afterward all the Israelites came near, and he instructed them concerning all 
that the Lord had imparted to him on Mount Sinai. And when Moses had finished speak- 
ing with them, he put a veil over his face. 

Whenever Moses went in before the Lord to speak with Him, he would leave the veil 
off until he came out; and when he came out and told the Israelites what he had been 
commanded, the Israelites would see how radiant the skin of Moses' face was. Moses 
would then put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with Him. 

After his encounter with God at Mount Sinai, the skin of Moses' face was radiant. This 
aura surrounding his face was so bright it frightened Aaron and all the chieftains. 



390 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


leading Moses to put on a veil, which Moses wore except when he spoke with God. 
Such auras are a common result of mystical experience. See, for example, "A Vision at 
the Wailing Wall," p. 63.

Exodus 34:29-35 


501. THE LIGHT THAT SHONE FROM MOSES' FACE 

When Moses descended Mount Sinai after forty days and nights, his body was bathed 
with invisible light, and an aura shone from his face that surpassed the splendor of the 
sun. Those who saw him were filled with awe, for his appearance was far more beautiful 
than when he had gone up. So bright was the dazzling light that flashed from his face, 
that all the righteous among the children of Israel were burned when they observed it. 

Some say that radiance clung to Moses after he spoke with God face to face, as it is 
said. The skin of his face was radiant , since he had spoken with Him (Exod. 34:29). Others say 
that the radiance shone forth from the cave where God put His Hand in front of his face, 
as it is said, "And I will shield you with My Hand" (Exod. 33:22). Still others say that light 
was the light of the first day, which God restored to Moses upon Mount Sinai, and which 
Moses drew upon for the rest of his life. 

Then there are those who explain that for forty days and forty nights, Moses dipped 
his pen in black fire and wrote down all that the Lord commanded him to write. And 
when he finished writing, he saw that a drop of fire was still left upon the pen. And 
Moses took the pen and passed it over the hair of his head, and the skin of his face shone 
with radiance. That is why the children of Israel were unable to approach him until he 
put a veil over his face. 

When Aaron and the others saw the light shining from the face of Moses, they were 
afraid to come near him, for that light was a reflection of the divine radiance. Nor did 
that light go away. Indeed, Moses became a permanent source of light. And after that he 
wore a veil on his face at all times, except when he met with God or taught the Torah. 

Biblical commentators seek out the source of the divine radiance that shone from 
the face of Moses, as recounted in Exodus 34:29-35. See "Divine Radiance," p. 389. 

Rashi proposes that it was caused by God covering the face of Moses with His Hand. 

This interpretation, also found in Midrash Tanhuma, refers to Exodus 33:22-23: Wien 
My glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock , and I will cover you with My Hand 
until I pass by. Then I will take away My Hand . 

Ibn Ezra notes that the light that shone from the face of Moses shone like the light 
of the firmament. Rabbi Hayim ben Attar, author of Or ha-Hayim, asserts that the light 
continued to shine, so that Moses became a permanent source of light, and had to 
wear a veil. The fact that this veil was only lifted for the people when Moses taught 
Torah suggests that while teaching Torah, he revealed the unveiled truth. This also 
suggests that whoever studies Torah comes face to face with the divine radiance. 

What was the source of the divine radiance? It may be an intrinsic quality of the light 
that shines from God. The Zohar identifies it as the light of the first day of creation, 
which is said to exist in the World to Come. See "The Light of the First Day," p. 83. The 
Zohar also states that this light shone from the face of Moses during the first three months 
after his birth, but the light was withdrawn when the infant Moses was taken to Pharaoh's 
palace, and was returned to him only when he stood on Mount Sinai. 

One strange explanation for the rays of light that shone from Moses is found in 
Exodus Kabbah 47:6, where Rabbi Yehudah bar Nachman suggests that after Moses had 
finished writing down the Torah there was a little ink left over on the quill. Moses 
touched his forehead while holding the quill, and the ink that spilled on to his fore- 



MYTHS OF MOSES 391 


head turned into rays of light. The word keren, for "ray" is the same as the word for 
"horn," and this led to the understanding of the text — originally midrashic, taken up 
by Jerome in his Latin translation of the Bible — on which Michelangelo based giving 
Moses horns in his famous statue. 

The divine radiance is also linked to Noah. It was said to shine from the face of 
Noah since the time of his birth.

502. THE SOULS OF THE PATRIARCHS 

The souls of the fathers of the world, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the rest of the 
righteous, were raised from their graves and ascended into Paradise. They prayed before 
God, saying, "Master of the Universe, how long will You sit upon Your throne like a 
mourner, with Your right hand behind You, and not redeem Your sons and daughters 
and reveal Your kingdom in the world? How long will You have no pity upon Your chil- 
dren, who are made slaves among the nations of the world? Have You no pity?" 

Then God answered each and every one of them, saying, "Since these wicked ones 
have sinned and transgressed, how can I deliver them from among the nations of the 
world and reveal My kingdom?" 

Hearing this, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob began to weep. Then God said to them, 
"Abraham, My beloved, Isaac My elect, Jacob, My firstborn, how can I save them at this 
time?" 

Then Michael, the Prince of Israel, cried out with a loud, tormented voice and said, 
"Why do You stand far off, O Lord?" 

This is one of several mythic accounts of the patriarchs attempting to intercede 
with God to show mercy for the people of Israel, who are suffering in exile, and to 
hasten the End of Days. Here God, while highly respectful to the patriarchs, essen- 
tially refuses their plea. This provokes Michael, the angelic protector of Israel, into a 
loud protest and lament at God's failure to act. For other examples of the patriarchs 
interceding for the sake of Israel, see "The Pleading of the Fathers" p. 515, and "The 
Patriarchs Weep over the Destruction of the Temple," p. 427.

503. THE PILLAR OF CLOUD 

During forty years of wandering, the Israelites were led by a pillar of cloud during the 
day and by a pillar of fire at night. Moses looked to the pillar of fire to guide them on their 
journey. When Moses saw the pillar of cloud rise above the Tabernacle, he stood and 
cried out to the people, and when they heard this they made ready to journey. They 
gathered together their vessels and precious things and put them upon their cattle. And 
anyone who had no beast to carry his burden put all his precious things upon the cloud 
that went before the camp. And they blew the trumpets, and the tribe of Judah journeyed 
first. Then the pillar of cloud guided them as they journeyed to the Holy Land. 

Many centuries later, as Rabbi Moshe Cordovero lay on his deathbed, his disciples 
begged him to reveal his successor. But the Ramak, as the rabbi was known, refused to do 



392 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


so. Instead he told them to watch for a sign: whoever saw a pillar of cloud at his funeral 
would be the one they should follow. This greatly confused the disciples, and when the 
Ramak died, all of Safed was filled with mourning. 

As the funeral procession reached the graveyard, a young disciple named Rabbi Isaac 
Luria, approached Rabbi Joseph Karo, and said: "Ever since we left the synagogue, there 
has been a pillar of cloud going before us." He pointed to it, but it was invisible to all the 
others. And when he entered into it, he vanished from their sight. For a long moment 
everyone stood in disbelief. Then Rabbi Isaac stepped out of the cloud, which only he 
could see, and his face was glowing like the face of Moses as he descended Mount Sinai. 
And indeed it was the same cloud that had enveloped Moses at the top of Sinai, and 
carried him into heaven, so that he could receive the Torah from the finger of God. 

Then they all understood that this was the sign the Ramak had given them, and that 
Rabbi Isaac was destined to be their teacher. So it was that after the funeral many of the 
disciples of the Ramak came to Rabbi Isaac and asked to study with him. At first the Ari, 
as he came to be known, was reluctant, for until then he had concealed his holy ways. But 
at last he agreed, and for the two years that he remained in this world, he was their 
master of Torah, and his teachings still echo to this day. 

The pillar of cloud led the Israelites in their desert wandering during the day, as 
stated in Exodus 13:21: And Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead 
them along the way. This story links Rabbi Moshe Cordovero with Rabbi Isaac Luria, 
the Ari, explaining how the Ari became his successor. Thus, in a single stroke, this tale 
links the Ari both to his immediate predecessor, Moshe Cordovero, and to the biblical 
Moses. The fact that both are named Moses (Moshe in Hebrew) only underscores the 
link between them. Thus the story suggests that the Ari and his predecessors were of 
the stature of the biblical patriarchs, and that the miracles of the sort that occurred in 
the time of Moses could still occur in their own time.

504. THE SEVEN CLOUDS OF GLORY 

As the Israelites wandered through the wilderness, they were covered by seven clouds of 
glory, one cloud on each of their four sides, one cloud above them, so that rain or hail 
would not fall on them, and so that they would not be burned by the burning heat of the 
sun, and one cloud below them so that thorns and serpents and scorpions would not 
harm them — and one cloud went before them to level the valleys and lower the moun- 
tains, and to prepare a dwelling place for them. 

Targum Pseudo-Yonathan appends this description of the seven clouds of glory that 
accompany the Israelites to the verse The Israelites journeyed from Raamses to Succoth 
(Exod. 12:37). 

Just as the myth of Miriam's Well provided fresh water for the Israelites in their 
desert wanderings, this myth describes seven clouds of glory that protected the Isra- 
elites from above and below and even a cloud that went before them to level valleys 
and lower mountains. Behind these myths is the awareness that travel in the desert is 
treacherous, with dangers on all sides, especially dangers from the elements. The 40 
years of wandering of the Israelites was doubtless filled with great suffering, but since 
the Exodus is regarded as a great liberation, these myths arose to portray the Exodus 
as taking place under the complete protection of God.

MYTHS OF MOSES 393 


505. MOSES' LAST REQUEST 

When the time came for Moses to take leave of this world, he made one last request to 
God: "Grant my wish, O Lord. Command the heavens to open and be split asunder, so 
that light shines in the darkness, so that the eyes of the children of Israel may be opened 
and they shall see there is none beside You, O Lord, in the heavens and the earth." 

No sooner did Moses finish speaking than the seven heavens were opened and all the 
depths were cleft asunder, and a great light shone in the darkness. And the eyes of the 
children of Israel were opened and they saw there is nothing in heaven or on earth to 
compare with the splendor of God, and they called out to each other, "Hear, O Israel! The 
Lord is our God , the Lord alone " (Deut. 6:4). 

Here the last request Moses makes is not for himself, but for the people of Israel, 
that the heavens be split apart so that the people could see the splendor of God. 
Throughout the long wandering in the wilderness, the people continually lost faith 
both in Moses and in God. Here Moses tries once more to renew their faith, and God 
grants his last wish. 

It is interesting to note that just as Moses' first experience of God closely resembles 
a mystical experience, here his last experience before dying is also a mystical revela- 
tion, although here it is a collective, rather than a personal one.

506. JOSHUA AS OEDIPUS 

Joshua's father was a holy man who lived in Egypt. He and his wife had no children, so 
the Tzaddik prayed to God for a child, and God heard his prayers. But while she was 
pregnant, heaven revealed to him that the son who would be bom to him would one day 
cut off his head. On learning this, the holy man mortified himself and wept day and 
night. His wife could not understand this, since God had seen fit to bless them with a 
child. She said, "You should rejoice at the Lord's blessing." Then the Tzaddik revealed his 
vision to her, and she knew that his words must be true. 

It came to pass that a son, Joshua, was bom to them. And his mother put him in an ark 
made of pitch and slime and cast it into the Nile, and God saw to it that a great fish 
swallowed the ark. Now it happened that the king gave a feast for all his princes. And the 
fish that had swallowed the ark was caught that day and brought before the king. And 
when they cut it open, they discovered a weeping child. The king and all the princes 
marveled at this, and the king ordered a woman to be found to nurse the child. And the 
boy grew up in the palace of the king and came to serve as a guardsman. 

Years later it happened that Joshua's father transgressed against the king. The king 
ordered the guardsman to cut off his head, and to take his wife and property for himself, 
for that was the custom in those days. Thus it came to pass that Joshua did execute him, 
as the king had commanded. But when he approached his mother, to lie with her, milk 
began to spill from her breasts, filling the bed with milk. Fearing the woman was a witch, 
Joshua was about to slay his mother when she remembered the prophecy of Joshua's 
father, and she cried out to him, "This is not sorcery. This milk is the same milk you 
suckled, for you are my son." And she revealed all that had happened. 

Then Joshua told her how he had been found inside a fish, and how he had never 
known his true mother and father. Then they knew that heaven's prophecy had been 
fulfilled. And now that he knew the truth, Joshua repented of his sins against his parents. 



394 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


and his repentance was accepted in the eyes of God. And he came to serve Moses, and 
when Moses took leave of this world, he led the children of Israel into the Promised Land. 

This remarkable story is a Jewish retelling of the Oedipus myth, in which Joshua 
bin Nun, the successor of Moses, who led the Israelites into the Land of Israel, is said 
to have earlier fulfilled the prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother. 

At the same time, this myth retells the story of the infant Moses being left in an ark 
made of pitch in the Nile (Exod. 2:3-6), and like Moses, Joshua is also said to have 
been raised in Pharaoh's palace. Note that this version of the tale refers to Pharaoh as 
a king, demonstrating a certain distance from the biblical tale. 

So too does this myth draw directly from the story of Jonah, who was swallowed 
by a whale (Jonah 2:1). Here the fish swallows the ark containing the infant Joshua, 
and the child is discovered alive inside the fish, an appropriate discovery for a child 
marked by destiny. This imaginative myth may have been inspired by the name of the 
father of the biblical Joshua: "Nun," the Aramaic word for "fish." 

It seems clear that this myth was intended to provide a mythic origin for Joshua, in 
order to present him as a worthy successor to Moses, indeed, one with an equally re- 
markable origin. At the same time, it serves as a vehicle for a Jewish version of Oedipus. 
Finally, it vividly demonstrates the power of redemption. Here the story diverges en- 
tirely from the Oedipus myth, which culminates in the tragedy of Oedipus blinding 
himself. Instead, this Jewish version has Joshua's repentance entirely accepted, and he 
ends up leading the people. Leading, of course, requires good vision, and the contrast to 
the blind Oedipus is obvious. Thus this myth must also be viewed as a Jewish answer to 
Oedipus. The answer is that no man's sins are beyond repentance. 

In overtly combining three very famous myths — the story of the baby Moses left in 
the ark, the story of Jonah being swallowed by the whale, and the myth of Oedipus— 
this myth about Joshua demonstrates its literary as well as its mythic intentions. It has 
all the earmarks of a consciously created myth, invented in order to add mythic reso- 
nance to the story of Joshua, which is otherwise entirely overshadowed by that of Moses.

507. MOSES NEVER DIED 

Moses never died, instead he is in exile with the Shekhinah, and God has given him the 
task of taking the people of Israel and the Shekhinah out of exile. Just as Moses led the 
children of Israel out of slavery and to the Promised Land, so too will he lead them out of 
exile. Meanwhile, God has cast a deep sleep upon Moses, and he will sleep until the time 
comes for the exile of the Jewish people to come to an end. 

That Moses never died is deduced from the biblical verse that asserts that No one 
knows his burial place to this day (Deut. 34:6). As evidence that Moses is sleeping and not 
dead, Sifre on Deuteronomy reinterprets the verse Moses was one hundred and twenty 
years old when he died, his eyes were undimmed and his vigor unabated (Deut. 34:7). Here 
the final phrase reads literally "his moisture had not dried up," and apparently im- 
plies that even at the advanced age when he died, Moses was still sexually potent. In 
the Sifre , Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya'akov says: "Do not read 'his moisture had not dried 
up/ but rather read 'his moisture is not dried up' — even until now anyone who touches 
the flesh of Moses, moisture ascends here and there." In the Talmud, the verse And he 
was there with Yahweh (Exod. 34:28) is offered as evidence that Moses did not die, but is 
still "standing" (i.e., living) and ministering to God (B. Sota 13b). In Zohar 1:28a, one 
reason given for Moses avoiding death is that because he perfected himself during his 
lifetime, he rectified the sin of Adam that brought death into the world. Therefore he 
did not die.

508. KING DAVID IS CROWNED IN HEAVEN 

There are two thrones in heaven, one belonging to God and the other to King David, for 
King David was not only crowned on earth, but he was also crowned in heaven. The 
coronation took place in a great House of Study in the seventh heaven, where a fiery 
throne awaited him. Groups of angels wove garments of salvation and made crowns of 
life, fixing precious stones and pearls in them, and anointing them with all kinds of spices 
and delight. All of these were destined for David, King of Israel. Every kind of angel 
came forth, as well as all of the heavenly creatures. So too were all of the heavenly trea- 
suries present, along with the clouds of glory, the stars, and all the constellations. Sud- 
denly all of them trembled and cried out, "The heavens declare the glory of God" (Ps. 19:1) 
and lo! King David stood before his throne, facing the throne of God, with all the kings of 
the House of David before him, and all the kings of Israel behind him. Then God took His 
crown and put it on David's head. 

King David's heavenly crown had the sun, moon, and the twelve constellations fixed 
on it, its radiance radiating from one end of the world to the other. When the crown was 
placed on his head. King David began to recite psalms of unimaginable beauty that had 
never been heard before. All the angels and heavenly creatures joined in, along with the 
firmaments, so that the song echoed everywhere, "God is one and His name is one." 

Then a loud voice came forth from Eden, crying, "The Lord shall reign forever and 
ever!" and King David ascended to the heavenly Temple, where a throne of fire was set 
for him forty parasangs in height. And when David came and sat down upon his throne, 
which was opposite the throne of his Creator, he uttered songs and prayers such as had 
not been heard since the creation of the world. 

In B. Sanhedrin 38a, Rabbi Akiba states that there are two thrones in heaven, one for 
God and one for King David. This angers Rabbi Jose, who says, "Akiba, how long will 
you profane the Shekhinahl Rather, one throne is for justice and the other for mercy." 

This follows the interpretation that God has two heavenly thrones. When He sits on 
the Throne of Mercy, He is merciful, and when He sits on the Throne of Justice, He is 
harsh in His judgment. 

Later, in Midrashei Geulah and Masekhet Atzilut and other texts, this undeveloped 
myth about King David sharing the role of ruling the world with God is elaborated, 
with a detailed description of King David's heavenly coronation. God takes His crown 
and puts it on David's head. This is a very radical myth. It elevates King David to the 
celestial realm, where he undergoes a heavenly coronation. Thus David can be seen 
not only as God's representative on earth, but one who participates fully in the ritual 
of divine kingship. The myth strongly implies that David's role is parallel to that of 
God, whose throne he faces, making him a "lesser Yahweh." In this way the myth 
resembles those about other saintly figures who became the focus of Jewish cults, 
such as Enoch/Metatron and Jacob. See the Introduction, pp. 1, lvii-lviii. Hekhalot Rabbati 
reaffirms David's role as co-ruler of heaven. Together, these three texts demonstrate 



396 MYTHS OF THE HOLY PEOPLE 


the development of the myth of King David ruling with God in heaven, which starts 
off as a very brief statement by Rabbi Akiba in the Talmud. 

The most extensive divinization tradition among the patriarchs and kings is that 
associated with Jacob. See "Jacob the Divine," p. 366. One passage in the Bible hints at 
such a tradition associated with King Solomon: Then Solomon sat on the throne of the 
Lord as king (1 Chron. 29:23). In Song of Songs Rabbah 1:13 Rabbi Isaac asks: "Is it pos- 
sible for a man to sit on the throne of the Lord?" Even raising this question hints at 
Solomon s divine elevation. There are also enthronement myths about Adam and 
Moses. See "The Enthronement of Adam," p. 131 and "The Enthronement of Moses," 
p. 388.

509. KING DAVID'S HARP 

A harp hung above King David's bed, and precisely at midnight a north wind arrived 
and blew on the harp and it would play by itself. Then King David would arise and 
study Torah until the break of dawn. 

This is a famous talmudic legend about King David's harp. This brief legend trans- 
forms that harp into an enchanted one. This legend echoes Genesis 1:2: The spirit of 
God hovered over the waters . Here God's spirit hovers over the waters the way the wind 
blows on the strings of the harp. 

Later in Jewish folklore, this same harp became the object of fairytale quests. See, 
for example, "King David's Harp" in Miriam's Tambourine , pp. 163-167. 

In Likutei Moharan Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav offers an allegorical reading: the 
five strings of the harp represent the Five Books of Moses. The wind represents the 
hidden spirit (ruah— which also means "wind") in each Jew. When that spirit comes in 
contact with the five strings of the harp (the Five Books of Moses), the music of new 
revelations is produced. For Rabbi Nachman, waking up refers to everyone's need to 
wake up spiritually.

510. THE ANGEL OF THE LORD 

God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but as he was about to wreak destruction, 
the Lord saw and renounced further punishment and said to the destroying angel. 
Enough! Stay your hand!" The angel of the Lord was then standing by the threshing 
floor of Oman the Jebusite. David looked up and saw the angel of the Lord standing 
between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand directed against Jerusalem. 
David and the elders, covered in sackcloth, threw themselves on their faces. 

King David's vision of a giant angel standing between heaven and earth with a 
drawn sword in his hand is certainly terrifying and memorable. The meaning of this 
myth is that Jerusalem was on the verge of total destruction when God intervened, 
just as He had done with the sacrifice of Isaac, and prevented it at the last minute. 



MYTHS OF KINO DAVID 397 


Note the parallel of God's words here to those spoken by the angel to stop Abraham 
from sacrificing Isaac (Gen. 22:12).

511. THE MOUNTAIN OF FIRE 

Once, when King David was walking in a very thick forest, he became tired, so he lay 
down and fell asleep. While he was sleeping, the angel Michael came to him and whis- 
pered in his ear, "Wake up! Now is not the time to be asleep." When David opened his 
eyes, he saw a mountain in the distance that was burning in fire. He raised his eyes to the 
mountain, and he saw the letters YHVH flashing before him. All at once the fire sur- 
rounding the mountain vanished, but letters of fire remained, carved into the mountain, 
spelling God's Name. 

This is a little-known tradition about King David, which links David to Moses by 
evoking Mount Sinai at the time of the Giving of the Torah. In addition, it reaffirms 
that the God of King David is the same God of Moses, known by the Name YHVH. 

This myth also echoes the midrashic tradition about Abraham and Isaac seeing a holy 
light — the light of the Shekhinah — surrounding Mount Moriah. Thus one brief myth 
manages to create a line of continuity between Abraham, Moses, and David, while 
emphasizing that they all worshipped the same God.

512. THE THIRTY-SIX JUST MEN 

In each generation there are thirty-six just men, known as the Lamed-vav Tzaddikim, the 
thirty-six righteous ones. They are hidden saints who are blessed to be able to see the 
Shekhinah. The world exists because of their merit. When one of them dies, another is 
bom to take his place. Because of these thirty-six just men, God permits the world to 
exist. Thus they are the pillars of existence. 

Few are those who escape the punishments of Gehenna. But when these saints take 
leave of this world, their souls immediately ascend on high, to the heavenly rewards 
awaiting them. 

The myth of the 36 hidden saints — known as the Lamed-vav Tzaddikim — first appears 
in the Talmud and later becomes a staple of folk, kabbalistic, and Hasidic tales. B. Sanhedrin 
97b suggests that each of these righteous men must be approved by the Shekhinah. The 
number of hidden saints varies at first, with some texts listing the number as 30 ( Genesis 
Rabbah 35:2), and some as 45 (B. Hullin 45a). However, the number 36 became the stan- 
dard, perhaps because it is twice 18 — heh in Hebrew — which also means "life." It was 
believed that any stranger could turn out to be one of the Lamed-vav Tzaddikim , and there- 
fore respect should be shown to everyone. Many of the tales about the just men describe 
them as living in remote places, such as forests, where they engage in mystical study. 

Andre Schwarz-Bart wrote a famous novel. The Last of the Just , based on this myth, 
although he revised it in substantial ways. In the novel, the hidden saints descend 
from a single family line. 

Yisroel Yakov Klapholtz published a two-volume collection of tales about the 36 
just men, entitled Lamed-Vav Tzaddikim Nistarim.

BOOK EIGHT 


MYTHS OF THE HOLY LAND 



The land you are about to cross into and possess, a 
land of hills and valleys, soaks up its water from the 
rains of heaven. It is a land which the Lord your God 
looks after, on which the Lord your God always keeps 
His eye, from year's beginning to year's end. 

Deuteronomy 11:11-12 



THE CARDEN OF EDEN 


513. THE GARDEN OF EDEN 

The Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and placed there the man whom He 
had formed. And from the ground the Lord God caused to grow every tree that was 
pleasing to the sight and good for food, with the Tree of Life in the middle of the garden, 
and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. 

A river issues from Eden to water the garden, and it then divides and becomes four 
branches. The name of the first is Pishon, the one that winds through the whole land of 
Havilah, where the gold is. (The gold of that land is good; bdellium is there, and lapis 
lazuli.) The name of the second river is Gihon, the one that winds through the whole land 
of Cush. The name of the third river is Tigris, the one that flows east of Asshur. And the 
fourth river is the Euphrates. 

The Lord God took the man and placed him in the garden of Eden, to till it and tend it. 
And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden you are free 
to eat; but as for the tree of knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat of it; for as soon 
as you eat of it, you shall die." 

The Garden of Eden serves as the primary archetype of the lost Paradise where our 
ancestors, Adam and Eve, failed a divine test and were cast out. As a wandering desert 
people, much like the Bedouins of today, the ancient Hebrews would naturally look 
forward to finding the next oasis. Such an oasis, with many kinds of fruit trees, was 
probably the original model for the Garden of Eden, the ultimate oasis. Not only do 
Adam and Eve have everything they need while living in the Garden, but God some- 
times walks there in the cool of the day (Gen. 3:8). They only have one rule to obey: 
not to eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. Of course. Eve and then Adam cannot 
resist tasting the forbidden fruit. Like Pandora, they unleash the unknown and find 
themselves exiled from the Garden of Eden. 

From a psychological perspective, the Garden of Eden might be seen as childhood, 
the kind of childhood where a child lives in a protected world and all of his or her 
needs are met. It is the discovery of sex that causes them to be expelled from the 
Garden, from childhood, and the world outside the garden requires great effort on 
their part to survive. From this perspective the Fall might be viewed as the tasting of 
the forbidden fruit — sex.

514. THE CREATION OF THE GARDEN OF EDEN 

Some say that the Garden of Eden was planted by God's right hand before the earth was 
created. Indeed, it was one of seven things created before the creation of the world. 

Michael Stone distinguishes three views of Paradise that are found in 4 Ezra. One 
is the pre-existent Paradise, as described here. Another is an eschatological Paradise, 
as found in 4 Ezra 7:38 and 8:52. The third is a Paradise of mystical association, such 
as the traditions associated with the term Pardes , which is identified both as a mys- 
tical orchard and as Paradise in B. Hagigah 14b. See "The Four Who Entered Para- 
dise," p. 173.

515. THE HIDDEN GARDEN 

The Garden of Eden is well hidden. It is closed on every side, and guarded in a number of 
ways so that none can see it, not even the angels or the eye of a prophet or seer, as it is 
said. No eye has seen it, Lord, but You (Isa. 64:3) . Indeed, just as a nut is enclosed within a 
shell, so Eden is a world within. For theGarden of Eden was planted by God Himself, as 
it is said. The Lord God planted a garden in Eden (Gen. 2:8), and He planted it with His 
complete Name. — 

The Garden of Eden is the dwelling place of holy souls, both those who have already 
descended to this world and those who will descend in the future. These souls are said to 
be entirely preoccupied with Torah. In this way they are unified with God and absorbed 
into the light of God. 

Since no one knows where the Garden of Eden can be found, this myth offers one 
explanation of its fate. For once Adam and Eve were expelled from the garden, it 
largely vanishes from the Bible. However, it often reappears in every phase of subse- 
quent Jewish literature. This myth explains that it is hidden, which is why it is not 
encountered more often. A different explanation is found in 3 Baruch 4:10, where the 
Garden is said to have been lost in the Flood: "When God brought the Flood, the 
water entered Paradise and killed every flower." 

This myth also serves as a commentary on Genesis 2:8, The Lord God planted a gar- 
den in Eden, and on the verse from the Song of Songs 6:11 , 1 went down to the nut grove. 

The latter verse is often interpreted mystically, with the nut grove understood to refer 
to the Garden of Eden. In kabbalah, on the other hand, the Garden of Eden was not an 
actual, physical location, but a mystical one, very possibly an internal state, which 
one reaches by mystical means. 

In Torat Moshe on Genesis 2:9, Rabbi Moshe Alshekh describes the Garden of Eden 
as essentially supernatural. But when a branch or leaf is taken out of the garden, it 
becomes a regular earthly branch or leaf. Thus the olive branch that Noah's dove 
brought from the Garden of Eden turned into a real one. 

For folktales about such a journey to the Garden of Eden, see 'The Prince of Coucy" 
in Miriam's Tambourine , pp. 173-185, and "The Waters of Eternal Life/' pp. 122-134, and 
"The Gates of Eden" in Gabriel's Palace , p. 62. 

Note that the term Gan Eden , literally, the "Garden of Eden," has two meanings — it 
refers to the earthly garden, but it also refers to Paradise, and in Jewish lore the two 
meanings often blur into one. These two meanings also gave birth to the notion that 
there are two gardens — the earthly garden where Adam and Eve once made their 
home and the heavenly Eden, which is Paradise. A discussion of the upper and lower 
Gan Eden is found in Zohar 3:182b.

516. THE FRUIT OF THE TREE OF LIFE 

The Tree of Life is in the midst of the earthly garden, and nearby is the Tree of the Knowl- 
edge of Good and Evil. God enters the garden with the righteous, as it is said. They heard the 
sound of the Lord God moving about in the garden at the breezy time of da y (Gen. 3 $). Then the 
Tree of Life gives forth a fragrance that permeates the whole garden, and tKat fragrance 
sustains all the righteous who live there. As it spreads out, the leaves shout for joy. 



THE CARDEN OF EDEN 403 


Some say that every New Moon and festival the righteous sit down and eat the delica- 
cies of the Tree of Life. It s fruit is life and rest . Others say that every night the souls of the 
righteous rise up to the Garden of Eden and at midnight God comes to the garden to 
delight in them. Then God stands near that tree, and the righteous come and prostrate 
themselves before the cloud of glory. And a fountain of blessings in the garden cascades 
upon the head of every one of the righteous, and God rejoices with them. 

All of Israel is attached to the Tree of Life. Some are attached to its trunk, some to its 
branches, some to its leaves, some to its roots, as it is said. The Torah is a Tree of Life to those 
who cling to it (Prov. 3:18). In the future, all of Israel will taste of the Tree of Life, and 
because of it tHfey"wilHeave their exile in a compassionate way. 

This myth has several layers of meaning, as it refers to the Tree of Life found in the 
Garden of Eden as well as to the Torah. The linkage between the two derives from the 
famous verse in Proverbs 3 T 8, It is aTree of Li fe to those w ho cling to it. The identifica- 
tion of the "it" with the Torah is so~pervasive that thisverse is commonly quoted as 
The Torah is a Tree of Life to those who cling to it. Zohar 3:73a makes this link explicit: 
"Israel is attached to the Torah, and the Torah to God." At the same time, the Tree of 
Life is the symbolic structure that re presents the ten sefiroE, t he ten divine emanation s 
j h^underh£ a^existence. So the free ot Lite actually reters to three things simulta- 
neously: tothe tree in the Garden of Eden, to the Torah, and to the structure of the ten 
sefirot. In the present myth, the tasting of the fruit of the Tree of Life symbolizes the 
end of Israel's exile and the beginning of the new era that will be initiated with the 
coming of the Messiah. , 

Midrash ha-Ne'elam in Zohar Hadash 18c also identifies the two trees in the Garden 
of Eden as two paths. The Tree of Life represents the path of the Torah, "which gives 
life to man, and enables him to know the good and straight path which perfects him." 

The Tree of Knowledge repr esents the path of evil, and "for this reason God com- 
manded him n ot to eat from it."

517. THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE AND THE TREE OF LIFE 

The Tree of Knowledge was forbidden to Adam, but not the Tree of Life. God did not 
prevent Adam from eating from the Tree of Life. He was free to do so. But after Adam 
sinned with the Tree of Knowledge, he was not allowed near the Tree of Life. Why? Be- 
cause the Tree of Knowledge is the gateway for entering the Tree of Life. 

Here we find a paradox worthy of Kafka: although God had forbidden Adam from 
eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, he was free to eat from the Tree of Life. And 
it is true that the Genesis narrative does not forbid Adam from eating from the Tree of 
‘Life. But after Adam sinned by eating the forbidden fruit, h e was expelled from the 
Qarden of Eden, and cherubim were placed before t he gates of Eden to svard theivay to 
^TTrerofUfe (Uen73:23). Thus, alter he sinned, the Tree of Life became forbidden to 
Adam. Yet, paradoxically, Gikatilla comments that the Tree of Knowledge was the 
gateway to the Tree of Life. This suggests that Adam could not have tasted of the Tree 
of Life without first tasting of the Tree of Knowledge. See "Paradise" by Kafka, p. 445. 

Gikatilla's paradox grows out of his kabbalistic interpretation of the Genesis ac- 
count of the two trees. For him, the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge symbolizes the 
kelippot , the "shells" or "husks" that represent forces of evil and result in separation 
and banishment. Thus when Adam ate of the forbidden fruit, he reaped a harvest of 



404 MYTHS OF THE HOLY LAND 


banishment. At the same time, the Tree of Knowledge represents Malkhut, one of the 
ten sefirot, while the Tree of Life symbolizes Tiferet, another of the sefirot. And Malkhut 
serves as the gateway to Tiferet in the kabbalistic system of emanations.

518. THE EVER-TURNING SWORD OF FLAME 

After Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden, God stationed east of the Garden of Eden the 
cherubim and the fiery ever-turning sword, to guard the way to the Tree of Lif e (Gpn 3-74) After 
that, no one had permission to enter there, except for the souls of the righteous who were 
purified by the cherubim. If they see a soul worthy of entering, they admit it, but if it is 
not, they drive it away, and it is punished by the flame of the ever-turning sword. 

There are two distinct phases in the role of the Garden of Eden in Jewish lore. The 
* ™ rst account °f Adam and Eve's life in the garden and their subsequent expul- 
sion. The second concerns the role of the garden after that, in which it becomes the- 
place that the souls of the righteous enter on their journey into Paradise. See "The 
Path of the Soul in the Garden of Eden," p. 168. 

The role of the cherubim (a type of angel) is clear in the first case, in that they were 
stationed at the gates of Eden in order to prevent Adam and Eve from reentering there 
For having tasted the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, they had become mortal, and 
therefore were no longer permitted access to the Tree of Life. This, at least, is the impli- 

’ Ca j°tj ° f . G “ eSiS ^ Ut W ^ at purpose do the cherubim serve after the time of Adam 

and Eve. They continue to serve as gatekeepers, keeping away anyone who tries to 
enter the garden, as does Alexander the Great. See "The Gates of Eden," p. 406. But once 
the Garden of Eden takes on its new role as the entry point for the souls of the righteous 
on their way to Paradise, the role of the cherubim also changed. From this point on they 
not only kept out those who were not permitted to enter, but they also admitted the 
souls of the righteous who were permitted to enter there. Somehow the cherubim were 
able to determine at once whether or not a soul was righteous enough to deserve entry 
As for those who were not, they were not only chased off, but, as stated in this myth 
from the Zohar, they were burned by the flame of the revolving sword. 

The cherubim play a similar role in the traditions about the High Priest entering 
the Holy of Holies of the Temple in Jerusalem on Yom Kippur. Two cherubim were 
portrayed on the cover of the Ark, and they were said to stand guard just like the 
cherubim that guard the gates of Eden. When the High Priest entered, he entered in 
. awe and dread. If he were worthy he would enter in peace and exit in peace. But if he 
were not worthy, a flame would shoot out from between the cherubim— similar to 
flame of the ever-turning sword — and he would die.

519. ABRAHAM'S TREE 

Wherever Abraham made his home, he always planted a tree. By way of the tree he could 
detect who clung to God and who clung to idol worship. When one who cleaved to God 
stood under that tree, its branches would spread out over his head, providing shade But 
the tree would recoil from any idolaters, lifting its branches, so that there was no shade 
When Adam ate the fruit of the Tree of Good and Evil, he caused death to enter into 
the world. But Abraham rectified the world with this tree, which is none other than the 
Tree of Life. 



THE CARDEN OF EDEN 405 


This myth picks up on the unfinished account of the Tree of Life in Genesis, and 
creates an entirely new myth concerning this tree, which is described as belonging to 
Abraham. The branches of this tree serve to identify the true beliefs of anyone who 
stands beneath it, and Abraham can plant and replant it wherever he goes. The under- 
lying assertion of the myth is that the appearance of Abraham in the world announced 
a new era, repairing the damage done by Adam when he ate the fruit of the Tree of the 
Knowledge of Good and Evil. Other sources, especially in the Zohar, also identify the 
Tree of Knowledge as the Tree of Death. Pesikta Rabbati 42:1 states that "this particular 
kind of tree brought death into the world." See also Zohar 1:35b, 1:37b, and especially 
3:119a. Here it is said that as soon as night commences, the Tree of Life departs for the 
higher regions and the Tree of Death begins to rule the world, and when it does, all of 
mankind experiences the taste of death. Not until the Tree of Life is aroused at day- 
break does the Tree of Death relax its hold. 

In kabbalah, the Tree of Knowledge is often identified as the Tree of Death. Although 
brief, this myth from the Zohar portrays the polarity of the Tree of Life and the Tree of 
Death, a polarity that is barely hinted at in the Genesis accounts of the Tree of Knowledge 
and the Tree of Life. In Folklore in the Old Testament , James Frazer offers an interesting 
theory about the relationship between the two trees. Frazer suggests it was God's inten- 
tion that Adam be immortal. Therefore God warned Adam not to eat the fruit of the Tree 
of Knowledge, for the Tree of Knowledge was originally the Tree of Death. Thus Frazer 
sees this divine test as one more myth about the origin of death: "We may suppose that in 
the original story there were two trees, a tree of life and a tree of death; that it was open to 
man to eat of the one and live forever, or to eat of the other and die; that God, out of good 
will to his creature, advised man to eat of the tree of life and warned him not to eat of the 
tree of death; and that man, misled by the serpent, ate of the wrong tree and so forfeited 
the immortality that his benevolent Creator had designed for him." (See Theodor H. 
Gaster 's Myth, Legend, and Custom in the Old Testament , p. 33.) 

Some Christian apocryphal sources also identify the Tree of Knowledge with the 
Tree of Death. The Gospel of Philip 94b states that the Tree of Knowledge "brought 
death upon those who ate of it." Therefore "it became the beginning of death." 

Since this myth comes from the Zohar , the sefirotic meaning of the Tree of Life cannot 
be overlooked. In kabbalistic terms, this refers to the interaction of the ten sefirot, the 
ten emanations that emerge from the unknowable aspect of God, known as Ein Sof, the 
Endless or Infinite. The myth sets up a dichotomy between the Fall and its consequent 
damage and the repair represented by the arrival of Abraham and the recognition of the 
one God, thus the beginnings of Judaism. Note that this same pattern of breaking apart 
and restoration is the precise pattern of the Ari's myth of the Shattering of the Vessels 
and the Gathering of the Sparks. See "The Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of 
the Sparks," p. 122. In general, however, the two poles of this dichotomy are the Fall and 
the messianic era, when the world will be restored to its prelapsarian condition.

520. THE CAVE OF THE FOUR WINDS 

The Cave of the Four Winds can be found at the entrance of a small cave in the Garden of 
Eden, not far from the Tree of Knowledge. That cave is covered by a curtain on which are 
inscribed many secret symbols. It is said that if a comer of that curtain is lifted, a great 
blast of wind will escape, enough to toss boulders into the air as if they were apples, and 
uproot trees planted on the sixth day of creation. If the entire curtain is lifted, the four 
winds will be set free, and the world will return to chaos and void. 



406 MYTHS OF THE HOLY LAND 

Rabbinic literature and medieval Jewish folklore greatly elaborate on the details of 
the earthly and heavenly Paradise. Here is the description of a cave in the Garden of 
Eden that contains all the winds. All that prevents the world from returning to chaos 
is this curtain, inscribed with secret symbols, that hangs before it. This myth can be 
read as a warning against delving into forbidden secrets, such as spells and other 
kinds of magic. Or, from a modem perspective, it can be seen as a warning against the 
dangers of nuclear destruction. This myth about the Cave of the Four Winds is found 
in the story "The Prince of Coucy." See Miriam's Tambourine , pp. 173-185.

521. THE GATES OF EDEN 

During his journeys, Alexander the Great once stopped by a stream. He had some salted 
fish with him, and when he washed it in the waters it gave off a wonderful fragrance. 
Alexander then drank some of that water and felt remarkably refreshed. He said: "This 
stream must come from the Garden of Eden. Let us see if we can find its source." So 
Alexander followed the stream until he reached the Gates of Eden. The gates were guarded 
by an angel with a flaming sword. The others in his company hid from the sight of the 
angel, but Alexander stood before the angel and said: "Open the gates for me!" The angel 
replied: "This is the gateway of the Lord , the righteous shall enter through it" (P s. 118:20)., 
When Alexander saw that he would not be admitted, he said: "I am a king who is highly 
regarded. Give me something!" Then the angel gave him an eye. Alexander went and 
weighed it against all his gold and silver, but the eye outweighed them all. He asked the 
angel how this was possible, and the angel said: "The eye of a human being is never 
satisfied." And Alexander asked: "How can you prove that this is true?" And the angel 
answered: "Take some dust and cover the eye and you will see for yourself." Alexander 
did this, and all at once the eye was restored to its true weight. 

There are many legends about Alexander the Great in Jewish lore. This one from 
the Talmud teaches Alexander the lesson that the lust of the human eye is limitless but 
is easily quenched by dust, that is, by death. Alexander learns this at the gates of the 
Garden of Eden, which is the one place that Alexander cannot conquer in the world, 
just as he cannot conquer death. Thus the moral of the tale is that there are built-in 
limits to the satisfaction of human desire, a moral that is appropriately directed at 
Alexander, a folk symbol of one who sought to go beyond all human limits. For other 
Jewish tales about the exploits of Alexander, see "Alexander Descends into the Sea" in 
Miriam's Tambourine, pp. 118-121, and "The Waters of Eternal Life," in the same book, 
pp. 122-134. 

According to Rabbi Samuel Eliezer Edels, known as the Maharsha, only those who 
do not amass worldly goods can enter the Garden of Eden.

522. THE LAND OF ISRAEL 

The Land of Israel is holier than all other lands, for the Land of Israel is under the direct 
providence of God, and the eyes of your God are always on it (Deut. 11:12). Before the Land 
of Israel was chosen, all lands were suitable for divine revelation; after the Land of Israel 
was chosen, all other lands were eliminated. Just as The Lord your God is the God of gods and 
the Lord of lords (Deut. 10:17), so the Land of Israel is the center of the inhabited earth and 



THE PROMISED LAND 407 


God's own inheritance. So too is it the central place for the study of the Torah and ascen- 
sions of prayer, as it is said, that is the gateway to heaven (Gen. 28:17). Even the air of the 
Land of Israel makes one wise. That is why it is said that "there is no Torah like the Torah 
of the Land of Israel." When Jews dwell in the Land of Israel, they eat from their Father's 
table and receive the light of wisdom directly from God. In contrast, all other lands are 
dark, as it is said. He has made me dwell in dark places (Lam. 3:6). Alas for the children who 
have been exiled from their Father's table! 

God considered all the nations and found no people fit to receive the Torah other than 
the people of Israel. So too did God consider all generations and found no generation fit 
to receive the Torah other than the generation of the wilderness. He also considered all 
mountains and found no mountain on which the Torah should be given other than Mount 
Sinai. And God considered all cities and found none to compare with the city of Jerusa- 
lem. So too did He consider all lands and found none suitable to be given to Israel other 
than the Land of Israel. 

The Land of Israel is not like Egypt, which is irrigated by the Nile like a garden. The 
Land of Israel is a land of hills and valleys almost exclusively intended to absorb the dew of 
heaven. For even though the physical Land of Israel exists, its essence is a spiritual matter, 
the life force coming from God. And all those who walk as little as four cubits in the Land 
of Israel are assured of a share in the World to Come, while all who are buried in the Land 
of Israel — it is as if they were buried beneath the altar of the Temple in Jerusalem. 

Monotheism is the central pillar of Judaism, but close in importance is the central- 
ity of the Land of Israel ( Eretz Yisrael). Indeed, the covenant between God and the 
people of Israel is manifest in the Land of Israel. As Rav Kook put it, "Love for our 
Holy Land is the foundation of the Torah" ("The Land of Israel," Orot, Jerusalem, 

1950, p. 9). 

The midrash from Leviticus Rabbah about God choosing the Holy Land is a com- 
mentary on the verse When He stands , He makes the earth shake (Hab. 3:6). According to 
Maimonides, so essential is the link of Israel to the Jewish people that if no Jews lived 
there, the Torah would vanish. 

The Land of Israel was believed to have sacred powers and there are a great many 
myths about the miracles that occurred there. From such a mythic perspective, the 
land is more than a place, it is also a sacred realm. It is believed that whoever desires 
to be a true Jew can only achieve this by means of the sanctity of the Holy Land, that 
by entering the Land of Israel, a person becomes part of its sacred nature. Further, 
prayers originating in the Land of Israel can bring about miracles and true wonders 
for the entire world. Any ascent of prayer can only take place in the Land of Israel, for 
that is where the ascent of prayers occurs. Without the sanctity of the Land of Israel, a 
descent into exile occurs, and prayer descends into exile, and it is impossible to pray 
and perform miracles in the world. 

In the Talmud it is said that whoever walks four cubits in the Land of Israel is 
assured of a place in the World to Come (B. Ketubot 111a). For this reason, many sages 
sought to make the journey. The Ba'al Shem Tov sought repeatedly to reach the Holy 
Land, but he never managed to get there. There are numerous folktales about his failed 
attempts. Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, great-grandson of the Ba'al Shem Tov, who be- 
lieved that he bore a spark of the Ba'al Shem Tov's soul, sought to journey to the Holy 
Land to complete his great-grandfather's quest for him. It was truly an epic journey 
during which Rabbi Nachman felt that he was engaged in a life and death struggle 
with the forces of evil. After a six month journey, he arrived the day before Rosh ha- 
Shanah, 1798. He believed that "the moment I walked four steps on the Holy Land, 

I achieved my goal" (Shivhei ha-Ran 15). And as soon as Rosh Hashanah was over. 
Rabbi Nachman was ready to return home. He wanted to leave at once. Having taken 
those four steps on the Holy Land, he felt he had completed his quest. However, his 



408 MYTHS OF THE HOLY LAND 


companion, probably his earliest disciple Rabbi Shimon, convinced him to visit some 
of the holy cities of Israel, and in this way managed to extend Rabbi Nachman's stay 
for a few months. 

For a contrast between the Land of Israel and the other lands, see "The Seventy 
Nations and the Land of Israel," following. 7

523. THE SEVENTY NATIONS AND THE LAND OF ISRAEL 

At the time of the creation, God decreed that the seventy nations that descended from 
Adam be placed in the charge o f seventy g uardi an angels , each nation being ruled by its 
own angel. Thus all the people of the world are watched over by guardian angels. God 
divided the world among these heavenly ministers, each one receiving a portion of the 
land upon which his nation dwells. The fate of a particular nation below depends on the 
status of its guardian angel. When the angel prospers, so does his nation; when he falls, 
so does his nation. Thus it is written that Yahweh will punish the host of heaven in heaven, and 
the kings of the earth on earth (Isa. 24:21). 

One land, however, was notentrusted to any minister. The Land of Israel is the center 
of the inhabited earth, so He put no angels, no officers, rulers or sovereigns over it. God 
kept it for Himself, saying, I am keeping this land under My own dominion, and when 
I find a man upon the earth who will follow My heart, I will place him as a seal upon My 
heart and settle him in this land. He will be guided directly by My authority, without any 
intermediary among the heavenly ministers, unlike the other nations." So too did God 
say, "Let Israel, who became My portion, inherit the land which became My portion." 
God provides sustenance there first, and only then to the rest of the world. 

All angels sing God's praises, but the guardian angels of the seventy nations can only 
sing to God under certain circumstances. The opportunity comes when a particular na- 
tion does some act of kindness to Israel. Then its guardian angel receives permission to 
sing before God. 

When the guardian angels of other nations fall from power, all memory of their exist- 
ence is completely wiped off the face of the earth. But when Israel, because of its trans- 
gressions, is oppressed by other nations, it is in a state of exile, under the dominion of 
their guardian angels. But, though it is subject to other nations and their guardian angels, 
Israel can never be totally destroyed, for its guardian and head is none other than God. 
Thus the Jewish people shall abide eternally and inherit the earth and its fullness. 

This myth explains the unique nature of the relationship between God and Israel, 
and of the centrality of the Land of Israel in that relationship. It explains that at the 
time God created the world. He distributed the various lands to the heavenly minis- 
ters and chose the Land of Israel for Himself, as explained in the verse For the Lord's 
portion is His people (Deut. 32:9). In effect, God serves as the heavenly minister of Is- 
rael, while all other nations are guided by ministering angels. As Rabbi Abraham Azulai 



THE PROMISED LAND 409 


(1570-1643) puts it in Hesed le-Avraham, "Each people has its own guardian angel, ex- 
cept the people of Israel, which is bound directly to God alone and to God's law." 
Since God rules over the angels, the relationship between God and the nation of Israel 
is clearly far more important than that of any other nation. These verses explain why 
God found Abraham worthy of settling in the Land of Israel, and raised him above 
the rest of the nations: " You are the Lord God who chose Abram , and brought him out of Ur 
of the Chaldeans , and gave him the name Abraham; and You found his heart faithful before 
You , and You made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the 
Amorite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite , and the Girgashite — to give it to his seed. And You kept 
Your word ; for You are righteous" (Neh. 9:7-8). 

In this view, Israel is the Holy Land because God chose it for Himself. Other myths 
attribute the holiness of the Land of Israel to the land itself. See, for example, "Light 
from the Temple," p. 411. 

These beliefs about the divine role of the Land of Israel are the basis of the claim 
that "The Land of Israel is an inheritance from our forefathers" (B. A. Z. 53b). It is not 
a claim based on acquisition or military conquest, but one that derives from a decision 
of God, in which the Torah serves as the deed and the proof. From this point of view, 
exile is an unnatural state, and it is the obligation of the Jewish people to return and 
settle the Land of Israel.

524. HOW THE HOLY LAND BECAME HOLY 

God wears an exquisite ring on His finger. It contains precious gems of every kind: am- 
ethysts, emeralds, and sapphires, among them. Each of those gems lights the firmament 
with holy sparks, twinkling like a million stars. 

One day God decided to transform a bare and deserted land into a holy land. Till then 
there was nothing more than a desolate range of mountains. Then God turned the ring 
on His finger, and sparks flew over the Galilee and the Jordan valley. They landed in the 
desert, as far as the Dead Sea, and all at once the mountains were transformed, covered 
with a bluish gleam, and luminous circles surrounded the Jordan valley. 

God saw that it was good and turned His ring again, and fiery sparks covered the 
mountains like a glimmering tallit. God raised His hand, and a bit of a precious stone 
flew over the Negev and landed with such force that it melted and became the Sea of 
Eilat. It sparkles and shines day and night, never forgetting its origin in God's ring. 

God's gaze turned to the north, and He turned His ring once more and the most beau- 
tiful of God's sapphires fell to earth and became the Sea of Galilee. 

This is a myth of origin, explaining how a desolate land was transformed into a 
beautiful holy one through find's intprvpntinn A transformation takes place each time 
God turns His ring. Sparks fly from the ring that turn a desolate land into a sacred 
one. This may allude to the Ari's myth of the sparks. See "The Shattering of the Ves- 
sels and the Gathering of the Sparks," p. 122. This myth of God's ring also serves as an 
origin myth of the Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) and the Sea of Eilat, in which jewels from 
the ring fly to earth like comets and create them.

525. THE CAVE OF SHIMON BAR YOHAI 

Near the village of Peki'in in the Galilee there is a cave known as the cave of Shimon bar 
Yohai. That is fire cave in which Shimon bar Yohai and his son Eleazar hid from the Romans 
after they passed a decree calling for his execution. Shimon bar Yohai and his son remained 
in that cave for thirteen years, devoting themselves to the study of the Torah. 

Many miracles took place while they lived in that cave. During the first night they 
spent there, a well of living water formed inside the cave and a large carob tree grew 
outside it, filled with ripe carobs, that completely hid the entrance. When Shimon bar 
Yohai and his son discovered the spring and the tree that had appeared overnight, they 
drank from the water and tasted the fruit. The water was pure and delicious and the fruit 
was ripe, and they knew that their faith had been rewarded and that the Holy One, blessed 
be He, was guarding them. And they gave thanks. 

After that. Rabbi Shimon and his son cast off their clothes and spent each day buried in 
the sand, studying the Torah. Only when it was time to pray did they put on their white 
garments, and in this way they preserved them through the long years of their exile. 

Then a day came when Elijah the Prophet arrived at the cave to study with them. 
Elijah revealed great mysteries to them that had never been known outside of heaven. 
And in the days that followed Elijah often returned, and Shimon bar Yohai wrote down 
those mysteries on parchment that Elijah brought them, which came from the ram that 
Abraham had sacrificed on Mount Moriah in place of Isaac. Now that was an enchanted 
parchment, for as Shimon bar Yohai wrote, it expanded to receive his words. And every 
letter he inscribed there burned in black fire on white. And the name of the book that he 
wrote down there, filled with the celestial mysteries, was the Zohar . 

One day, as they watched from inside the cave. Rabbi Eleazar saw a bird repeatedly 
escape from a hunter, and he recognized this as a sign that they were free to leave the 
cave, for the Emperor had died and the decree had been annulled. But before they left, 
they hid the book of the Zohar in that cave, for they knew that the world was not yet 
ready for its secrets to be revealed. 

There the book of the Zohar remained for many generations, until an Ishmaelite who 
happened to find it in the cave sold it to peddlers. Some of its pages came into the posses- 
sion of a rabbi, who recognized their value at once. He went to all the peddlers in that 
area and found that they had used the pages of the book to wrap their spices. In this way 
he was able to collect all of the missing pages, and that is how the Zohar was saved and 
came to be handed down. 

Although this legend originated in a talmudic source, it became the basis for the 
kabbalistic legends about the talmudic sage Shimon bar Yohai, as well as for the ori- 
gin of the Zohar, the central text of kabbalah. According to this legend. Bar Yohai spent 
13 years in a cave, hiding from the Romans, who had condemned him. Moshe de 
Leon, who lived in Spain in the thirteenth century, attributed the text of the Zohar, 
which he claimed to have discovered, to Shimon bar Yohai, who was said to have 
written it during the years spent in hiding. However, modern scholars, especially 
Gershom Scholem, have demonstrated that the Zohar was actually the creation of Moshe 
de Leon, perhaps with the collaboration of his circle of kabbalists. The Zohar is a mys- 
tical commentary on the Torah, but it also contains many legends about Shimon bar 
Yohai and his disciples. The portrayal of Shimon bar Yohai in the Zohar became the 
model of the master for later sages, especially the Ari. And the Ari became the arche- 
type of the master for later rabbis, such as Shalom Sharabi and the Ba'al Shem Tov. So 
an imagined portrayal of a master by Moshe de Leon led to a real life emulation of the 
model. For a discussion about the authorship of the Zohar, see " A Note on the Sources/' 
p. 525, footnote *.

526. LIGHT FROM THE TEMPLE 

What was the source of the light that came forth when God said. Let there be light (Gen. 
1:3)? Some say it shone forth from the place where the Temple in Jerusalem would one 
day be built, and from there it illuminated the entire world. Surrounded by that light, 
God completed the creation of the world. Then God saw to it that the light of the Temple 
was diffused to all the world, as it is said, God has shined forth (Ps. 50:2). 

Others say that the light was created at the site of the Temple, and had never before 
existed. 

This holy light continued to emanate even after the Temple was built upon that place. 
Its source was in the Holy of Holies, in which the Holy Ark stood, and it lit up the Temple 
and shone forth through the windows. For there were windows in the Temple, but in- 
stead of light coming into them, it went out of them. Indeed, the windows were built for 
this purpose, narrow on the inside and broad on the outside, in order to send forth light 
into the world. And the light that shone forth from the Temple ascended to the firma- 
ment, to God's Chariot, and to the Throne of Glory, and the light filled Jerusalem and the 
Holy Land, and all basked in its presence. That is why it is said that Jerusalem is the light 
of the world. 

This myth about the origin of the first light derives from the verse And the earth was 
lit up by His Presence (Ezek. 43:2), where "Presence" is identified with the Temple in 
Jerusalem. There is a suggestion in this myth that the light pre-existed, and that the 
site on which the Temple was built was sacred from the time of Creation, if not before. 
Genesis Rabbah 3:4 states: "The light was created from the place of the Temple." This 
has theological implications, as it suggests that God created the universe out of exist- 
ing materials. See "God's Garment of Light," p. 82. 

The question of whether God used pre-existing materials in creating the world was 
a highly controversial one among the ancient rabbis, who considered it an esoteric 
matter. Rabbi Bar Kappara took the position that the Torah reveals that God did make 
use of pre-existing material, while Rav compared this to building a palace on a gar- 
bage dump, and Rabbi Jose ben Haninah asserted that the suggestion that God made 
use of pre-existing materials such as darkness, chaos, and void (tohu and vohu) im- 
paired God's glory. ( Genesis Rabbah 1:5). 

The notion that light pre-existed also is found in Isaiah 45:7: I form the light and 
create darkness. Here the important distinction is between "form" (yotzer) and "create" 
(borei), with "form" suggesting that the light already existed, while "create" refers to 
something that was brought into being ex nihilo. 

Midrash Tehillim presents a very terse version of this myth, asking where God dif- 
fused the light, with the answer that God had diffused it from the Temple. This is 
linked to the verse And the earth was lit up by His Presence (Ezek. 43:2) Here the phrase 
"the earth was lit up" is understood to mean the Temple. From this derives the inter- 
pretation that the light itself came from the place of the Temple. 

Genesis Rabbah 60:19, however, offers a different source for the light: "Who is the 
light of Jerusalem? God, as it is said, Yahweh shall be your light everlasting " (Isa. 60:19). 

This myth is likely of Jewish-Gnostic origin, as there was a primary Gnostic belief 
that light pre-existed the chaos that preceded creation. For an example of this Gnostic 
myth, see On the Origin of the World 2:97-98: "Seeing that everybody says that nothing 
existed prior to chaos, I shall demonstrate that they are all mistaken, because they are 



412 MYTHS OF THE HOLY LAND 


not acquainted with the origin of chaos, nor with its root .... After the natural struc- 
ture of the immortal beings had completely developed out of the infinite, a likeness 
then emanated and became a product resembling the primeval light." 

A related myth in B. Ta'anit 10a states that the Land of Israel was created first, and 
the rest of the world came afterward. This land is watered first, according to this myth, 
because it is watered by God Himself, and the rest of the world is watered through a 
messenger of God. Both myths, that of light from the Temple and that Eretz Yisrael was 
created first, insist on the centrality of the Land of Israel.

527. GOD BUILDS THE HEAVENLY TEMPLE 

When the time drew near for Moses to take leave of this world, God took him up to the 
highest heavens and showed him his reward as well as what was destined to take place 
in the future days. There Moses saw God building the sanctuary of the Temple out of 
precious stones and pearls, and out of the splendor of the Shekhinah. So too did Moses see 
the Messiah, the son of David, standing there, as well as his own brother, Aaron. 

Aaron said to Moses, Do not touch me, for no one may enter here until he gives up 
his soul and tastes the taste of death. Otherwise the flame of the Shekhinah will consume 
you." When Moses heard Aaron's words, he fell on his face and pleaded, "Master of the 
Universe, let me speak with your Messiah before I die." God gave His consent and said 
to an angel, "Go, teach Moses my great Name so that the flame of the Shekhinah will not 
consume him when he sees the Messiah/' 

When Moses had been taught the Name, he said to the Messiah, "Will God build a 
sanctuary on earth like the one He is building here in heaven?" The Messiah replied: 
"The house that God is building with His hands in heaven will exist for Israel until the 
end of all generations. While your father Jacob was sleeping, he saw the Temple that God 
will build on earth and the one being built in heaven. Jacob understood that this heav- 
enly House would exist for Israel forever, until the end of all generations. That is what 
Jacob meant when he awoke from his dream of the ladder reaching to heaven and said. 
This is none other than the abode of God, and that is the gateway to heaven (Gen. 28:17). And 
when the time comes, God will bring this heavenly Jerusalem down to earth." 

When Moses heard these words from the Messiah, he rejoiced greatly and turned his 
face toward God and said, "Master of the Universe, when will You bring down this Temple 
that is now being built?" 

God said, "I have not disclosed this to any living being, neither to the first ones or the 
last. Shall I tell you?" 

Moses said, "Master of the Universe, give me a hint." 

God said, "I will scatter the Israelites to the four comers of the earth, but one day I will 
bring them back to the Land of Israel." 

Moses descended from heaven contented. Then he gave his soul to God with a perfect 
heart and a longing soul. 



THE HEAVENLY JERUSALEM 413 


Here God brings Moses into heaven before his death to show him his heavenly 
reward and also to reassure him about the future destiny of Israel. There Moses is 
reunited with his deceased brother, Aaron, and he also meets the Messiah. This myth 
is significant because Moses himself is the model for the Messiah. Indeed, for the 
Samaritans Moses was a figure of messianic proportions. The myth also confirms the 
inevitability of subsequent Jewish history — the building of the Temple on earth as a 
mirror image to that already existing in heaven, and the eventual coming of the Mes- 
siah. While God's purpose in this myth is to reassure Moses, the real purpose is to 
reassure the Jews that despite their trials, God's plan for Israel would ultimately be 
fulfilled. For a similar heavenly encounter see "Jacob's Heavenly Vision," p. 357. 

This intriguing midrash builds both on the dream of Jacob (Gen. 28:12-17), and 
especially on the verse This is none other than the abode of God (Gen. 28:17), as well as on 
the tradition that Moses did not only ascend to the top of Mount Sinai to receive the 
Torah, but ascended all the way into heaven. In the most famous version of this leg- 
end, found in B. Shabbat 88b-89a, God reaches down and pulls Moses into heaven, so 
that he finds himself standing before God's Throne of Glory and sees God creating the 
crowns of the letters of the Torah. In the version from Pesikta Rabbati 20:4, Moses sees 
the angel Sandalphon standing behind God's throne, and God steps down from His 
throne to reassure Moses. In this version from Bereshit Rabbati , Moses sees God build- 
ing the heavenly Temple. Note that in the earlier midrash, God is creating the crowns 
of the letters of the Torah and here He is building the heavenly Jerusalem. Thus is God 
portrayed as taking an active role in the process of creation, especially as it relates to 
the people of Israel. 

This midrash also builds on the existing legends about the death of Moses. In most 
of these, Moses is very reluctant to die, and resists the Angel of Death. Here both God 
and the Angel of Death politely refrain from threatening to take Moses' soul until he 
is ready to release it. Still another midrash, in B. Sota 14a, asserts that Moses did not 
realize he was dying and was unaware of what was happening to him. In Likutei 
Moharan 1:4, Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav explains this by saying that Moses gave him- 
self completely to God, so that when God spoke to him he was unaware of his own 
existence. Therefore he was unaware of his own death. 

The version of this midrash found in Bereshit Rabbati takes an unusual turn in sug- 
gesting that God will bring the heavenly Temple down to earth. At first this might 
appear to be a way to describe the messianic era as if it were heaven on earth. But, in 
fact, it is probably intended to be understood literally, as it is described in another 
text, Tefillat Rabbi Shimon ben Yohai in Beit ha-Midrash 3:78-82: "Then a fire will come 
down from heaven and consume Jerusalem .... Then the perfect, rebuilt Jerusalem will 
come down from heaven .... Then the already constructed Temple will descend from 
heaven, for it is bound to the celestial abode, as Moses saw by the Holy Spirit: You will 
bring them and plant them (Exod. 15:17)." It seems likely that these texts are referring to 
the same tradition, in which the heavenly Jerusalem would descend to earth at the 
time of the advent of the Messiah. See "The Descent of the Heavenly Temple," p. 512. 

However, the version of this myth found in Pesikta Rabbati suggests that rather 
than bring the heavenly Temple down to earth, God will see to it that an earthly Temple 
will be built. Also, in this version Moses asked to know when the earthly Temple 
would be destroyed and God tells him that although it will be destroyed and the 
people of Israel will be scattered among all the nations, the day will come when He 
will gather all those who were exiled.

scent of the Heavenly Temple," p. 512.

528. THE HEAVENLY JERUSALEM AND 
THE EARTHLY JERUSALEM 


Everything that God created in heaven. He also created on earth. There is a heavenly 
Jerusalem that mirrors the earthly city, and a celestial Temple that is the mirror image of 
the one King Solomon built in Jerusalem. So too was the earthly Holy of Holies a counter- 
part of the heavenly one. But while the earthly Temple was destroyed, along with the 
Holy of Holies, the heavenly Temple still exists in all its glory. 

The Jerusalem on high faces the Jerusalem below. For out of God's great love for the 
earthly Jerusalem, He made another one on high, as it is said. Your walls are ever before Me 
(Isa. 49:16). 

The Jerusalem constructed in heaven is joined together with the one on earth. God has 
sworn that He will not enter the heavenly Jerusalem until the earthly one is rebuilt, as it 
is said, I will not enter the city (Hos. 11:9). God said, "What is there for Me in Jerusalem 
after My people have been taken from there?" 

God created a lofty palace on high, a holy city, the supernal city of Jerusalem. Whoever 
wishes to enter into God's presence may do so only from this city. That is the meaning of 
the verse This is the gateway to the Lord; the righteous shall enter through it (Ps. 118:20). 

One of the key principles of kabbalah is "as above, so below." The idea is that this 
world was created as a mirror image of heaven. Thus Jerusalem exists in both places, 
and there is still a heavenly Temple standing, although the earthly one was destroyed. 

Just as Jerusalem on earth is the holiest Jewish city, so the Jerusalem on high is the 
gateway to God's presence. One of the goals of the mystics who tried to ascend to 
Paradise was to find their way to the heavenly Jerusalem. 

As above, so below" has another important meaning — that prayer and some kinds 
of mystical study in this world could affect the world above. Therefore tikkun or re- 
pair done below, heals the world on high and brings God and His exiled Bride that 
much closer. 

According to one version of this myth, God has vowed to stay out of the heavenly 
Jerusalem until the earthly one is rebuilt. This would be a great sacrifice on God's 
part, similar to the exile the Shekhinah experiences since being cast out of Her home in 
this world, the Temple.

529. HOW MOUNT MORIAH WAS CREATED 

In the beginning Moriah was a vale, but God decided to make it the site of His sanctuary, 
so that His Shekhinah could reside there. So He made a sign to the mountains around the 
valley to come together, to make an abode for the Shekhinah. Then all the nearby moun- 
tains moved together and fused into one. That is how Mount Moriah was created. 

Others say that God created seven mountains, and of these He chose Mount Moriah as 
the site of the holy Temple, for that was the mountain which God desired as His dwelling (Ps. 
68:17). 

So too was Mount Sinai created out of Mount Moriah, for God said, "Since their father 
Isaac was bound upon this mount, it is fitting that his children receive the Torah upon it." 



THE HEAVENLY JERUSALEM 415 


So Mount Sinai plucked itself out of Mount Moriah as a priest's portion is plucked out of 
dough, and that is how it came into being. 

Mount Moriah is the mountain where God told Abraham to sacrifice Isaac (Gen. 

22). However, in the midrashic tradition it becomes identified with the Temple Mount 
in Jerusalem, and even comes to include the place where Cain and Abel made their 
offerings, as well as the offering of Noah at the end of the Flood. Here it is said to have 
had a supernatural creation, as it was God's intention from very early in Creation that 
it serve as His sanctuary on earth. 

Just as there is a creation myth about Mount Moriah, so there is one about how 
Mount Sinai was created out of Mount Moriah. This powerfully links these major 
biblical episodes, as well as tying them both to the Temple in Jerusalem. For the mount 
in Jerusalem where the Temple was built and where the Temple Mount is found today 
is called Mount Moriah (2 Chron. 3:7). 

The image of Mount Sinai plucking itself out of Mount Moriah is compared to the 
priest's portion being plucked out of dough. This refers to the priest's share of the 
bread as mentioned in Numbers 15:20.

530. THE ALTAR OF ABRAHAM 

Abraham and Isaac arrived at the place of which God had told him. Abraham built an altar there 
(Gen. 22:9). Some say that was the same altar on Mount Moriah where Adam made offer- 
ings, because the gate of the Garden of Eden was close by. Adam erected an altar to the 
Lord there, and on it he sacrificed an ox with one horn on its forehead. So too was it the 
same altar on which Cain and Abel made their sacrifices, and the same altar where Noah 
and his sons sacrificed. 

Others say the altar that Adam built was demolished by the waters of the Flood. Noah 
rebuilt it, but it was demolished in the generation of the Tower of Babel. Then Abraham 
built the altar there; he laid out the wood ; he bound his son Isaac ; he laid him on the altar, on top of 
the wood (Gen. 22:9). 

That was the site where in the future the Temple in Jerusalem would be built, and the 
place of the altar was the same as that of the Temple altar, where the High Priests made 
their sacrifices. 

This myth presents an archetypal altar on which many of the key biblical sacrifices 
prior to the building of the Temple were made. It asserts that the same altar was used 
by Adam, Cain and Abel, Noah and his sons, and it was situated on the same holy 
mountain. Mount Moriah, where God directed Abraham to go to offer his son Isaac. 
Further, the Temple Mount, known as Mount Moriah, is believed to be set in the same 
place. This is an example of mythic geography, with little consideration for actual 
geographic location. Instead, what matters is linking together these sacrifices in order 
to portray the existence of this archetypal altar for sacrifices to God. 

Others say that Adam and Eve lived on Mount Moriah, because the gate of the 
Garden of Eden was close by. Adam erected an altar to the Lord there, and on it he 
sacrificed a remarkable ox with one horn on its forehead. So too did Adam's sons, 

Cain and Abel, make use of that altar.

531. GOD PRAYS FOR THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE 

God has prayed for the building of the Temple since the days of Abraham, and even 
before. Why should God pray for this? Because man must build the earthly Temple first, 
and afterward God will send the heavenly Temple to rest upon it. All of Israel, together, 
is responsible for rebuilding the Temple. Everyone has an equal share, and everyone is 
obligated to participate. Once it is built, the earthly Temple will serve as the foundation 
for the one that will come from the heavens. 

The ultimate stage of the messianic era will be the descent of the heavenly Temple, 
which will come to rest on the earthly one. See "The Descent of the Heavenly Temple," 
p. 512. Before this can take place, the earthly Temple must be built, or, since the first 
two Temples were destroyed, rebuilt. This will prepare the necessary awakening from 
below that must precede the descent of the Temple from on high. According to Metzudat 
David, once the earthly Temple is built, God will take so much delight in it that He 
Himself will carve designs on the stones in order to beautify them. Thus God prays 
for the building of the earthly Temple so that the time may be hastened when the 
messianic era begins and He can lower the supernal Temple onto it. This belief serves 
as one of the primary motivations of fervent groups in Israel that are devoted to the 
building of the third Temple despite the fact that the Muslim Dome of the Rock has 
already been built on what is usually regarded as the site of the Temple.

532. THE CELESTIAL TEMPLE 

God's dwelling place above is directly opposite His dwelling place below. Just as there is 
an earthly Jerusalem, so too is there a celestial Jerusalem; just as there was an earthly Temple, 
so there is a celestial Temple located in the most sacred part of the heavens, not far from the 
Throne of Glory. The stars are its ornaments, and the angels serve as its priests. 

This is the Temple of God, standing on the summit of the firmament, its brilliance 
illuminating all the rooms of heaven. A thousand hosts stand before the Shekhinah in the 
celestial Temple, calling "Holy, holy, holy." And every host consists of many thousands 
of ministering angels. 

Some say that the celestial Temple existed on high even before the world was created, 
as it is said, O Throne of Glory exalted from the first (Jer. 17 : 12 ). Thus the upper Temple 
existed first, and God commanded that the lower Temple be made according to the se- 
crets of the upper one. Others say that God began the creation of His world at the founda- 
tion stone, and built the world upon it. Then He created the Celestial Temple, as it is said. 
The place You made to dwell in, O Yahweh (Exod. 15 : 17 ). 

Just as there is a High Priest in the TempIe"beIow, so there is a High Priest on high. 
Some say thaU^gos, the divine word, the first angel, serves as the heavenly High Priest. 
Others say that it islftetatron, while still others say that it is Michael, the prince of Israel, 
who serves as the High Priest, and offers sacrifices on the altar every day. What does he 
offer up? The souls of the righteou s. 

When tReearthly Temple still existed, the High Priest would make sacrifices and bum 
incense below, while Michael would do the same on high. After the earthly Temple was 
destroyed, God said to Michael, "From this time forward you shall offer me the good 
deeds of My children, their prayers, and the souls of the righteous, which are hidden 
beneath the Throne of Glory." 



THE HEAVENLY JERUSALEM 417 


Others say that since the heavenly Temple and the earthly one were built as counter- 
parts as long as the one stood, the High Priest offered up sacrifices and burnt incense, 
and the angel Michael offered up the souls of the righteous who dwell beneath the Throne 
of Glory, and all the angels came to the altar with incense, and they burned it until the 
cloud of incense covered the canopy of heaven. But once the earthly Temple was de- 
stroyed and the sacrifices abolished, the offerings on high came to an end as well. But in 
the future God will restore them. 

At the End of Days, when the time has come for the earthly Temple to be rebuilt, the 
heavens will open up, and the glory of the Temple's holiness will be revealed. Then God 
will bring the heavenly Temple down to the earthly Jerusalem, and the footsteps of the 
Messiah will be heard by one and all. 

Working on the principle of "as above, so below," Jewish lore postulates the exist- 
ence of a heavenly Jerusalem that is the mirror image of the earthly one, except that 
the heavenly Temple still stands, while that in this world has been destroyed. As is 
apparent from the large number of sources that refer to the celestial Temple, this was 
a widely recognized tradition. 

Isaiah 2:3 suggests the existence of the heavenly temple: "Come, let us go up to the 
Mount ofYahzveh, to the House of the God of Jacob " (Isa. 2:3). 

Philo offers an allegorical interpretation of the two temples: "There are, it seems, 
two temples belonging to God, one being this world, in which the High Priest is the 
divine word (Logos), his own firstborn son. The other is the rational soul, the repre- 
sentation of the universal heaven." 

See "God Builds the Heavenly Temple," p. 412, and "The Descent of the Heavenly 
Temple," p. 512.

533. THE TRUE TEMPLE OF GOD 

The highest and truest Templ e of God is the whole univers e. Heaven, its sanctuary, is the 
holiest part of all existence. Its priests are the angels, who serve God. Its offerings are the 
stars, which were placed in the pure temple of heaven that they might give light. 

Here Philo envisions th e^whole universe as a tpmp1 p_Qf HnH This is related to, but 
distinct from, the mythic tradition that there is a celestial temple in heaven that is the 
mirror image of the temple in Jerusalem. Philo's description of the heavenly temple 
might be viewed as a metaphor, a way of saying that God inhabits all of creation. It 
might also be viewed as a statement that this world is God's temple.

534. THE DESCENT OF THE HEAVENLY JERUSALEM 

Some say that in the future God will cause the Jerusalem on high to descend from heaven 
fully built, and will set it on the tops of four mountains: Mount Sinai, Mount Tabor, Mount 
Carmel, and Mount Hermon. Then the Temple will sing aloud, and the mountains will 
answer the song. So too will Jerusalem serve as a beacon to all of the nations, and they 
will walk in her light. Thus will God announce the Redemption. 

Others say that a beautiful and great city, built of precious stones and pearls, will 
descend from heaven, resting on 3,000 towers. How will the people ascend these towers? 
Like clouds and winged doves, for they will become flying beings. The houses and gates 
of the pious will have doorposts made of precious stones. The treasuries of the Sanctuary 
will be open to them, for there will be love of Torah and peace among them. 

Still others say that Jerusalem will descend from heaven and station itself like a pillar 
of fire from earth to heaven. Then all who want to come to Jerusalem will see that pillar of 
fire and will follow its light until they reach Jerusalem. For that light will be greater than 
that of the sun and moon, and will make their light dim. And they will dwell in that 
kingdom until the End of Days, seven thousand years from the days of creation. 

One of the key events of the messianic era will be the rebuilding of the Temple in 
Jerusalem. In this myth the problem of rebuilding the Temple is solved by having the 
heavenly Jerusalem— including the heavenly Temple— descend to earth and settle on 
the tops of four (or in some versions, three) mountains. 

This myth of the descent of the heavenly Jerusalem is based on two biblical verses. 

One, from Isaiah, says. In the days to come the Mount of Yahweh's house shall stand firm 
above the mountains (Isa. 2:2). The other verse. How welcome on the mountain are the foot- 
steps of the herald announcing happiness (Isa. 52:7), is given a mythic interpretation, where 
the messenger is the heavenly city of Jerusalem, here brought down to earth as a sym- 
bol of the transformation that will take place in the messianic era. This image, in itself, 
is quite beautiful, with the ethereal Jerusalem appearing as if in a vision, balanced on 
the tops of four key mountains in Jewish history. In some versions, however, it sits on 
the top of only the first three mountains listed, excluding Mount Hermon. This points 
to the different mythic meanings of the numbers three and four, both of which have 
key importance in Jewish lore. 

An extensive description of the future Temple is found at the end of the Book of 
Ezekiel 40-48, beginning with a vision: The hand ofYahweh came upon me , and He brought 
me there. He brought me , in visions of God, to the Land of Israel, and He set me down on a very 
high mountain (Ezek. 40: 1-2). 

Hai Gaon portrays Jerusalem as a pillar of fire, like the one that led the Israelites 
through the desert at night. That is to say, allegorically, that Jerusalem is the guiding 
light for the Jews, and the light it casts will be that described in Isaiah 30:26: The light 
of the moon shall be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the 
light of the seven days. 

Sefer Zerubavel describes the rebuilding of Jerusalem, with the Temple built on five 
mountains: Lebanon, Moriah, Tabor, Carmel, and Hermon. Here it is the Temple on 
top of these mountains, rather than Jerusalem itself. 

In 2 Baruch God tells Baruch about the heavenly Temple waiting to descend: "It is 
not this building (the Temple in Jerusalem) that is in your midst now; it is that which 
will be revealed, with Me, that was already prepared from the moment I decided to 
create Paradise."

THE HEAVENLY JERUSALEM 419 


535. THE ELEVATION OF JERUSALEM 

In the future, Jerusalem will be raised up until it reaches the Throne of Glory. So too will 
God add to Jerusalem a thousand gardens, a thousand towers, a thousand fortresses, and 
a thousand passages. 

This myth of the raising up of Jerusalem is the opposite of that of "The Descent of 
the Heavenly Jerusalem" (see p. 418). The latter speaks of the Jerusalem on high being 
brought down to earth, and this one of the earthly Jerusalem being raised on high. 

The consistent factor is the supernatural qualities associated with Jerusalem. 

The myth of two Jerusalems, one on earth and one in heaven, is hinted at in the 
apocalyptic 4 Ezra: In the days to come, when the signs foretold have come to pass, the 
city that is now invisible will appear, and the land which is now concealed be seen (4 
Ezra 7:26-27). This notion develops in the Talmud into a myth of two Jerusalems. Rabbi 
Yohanan said: "Jerusalem of this world is not like Jerusalem of the World to Come. 
Anyone who wants to visit Jerusalem in this world can do so, but only those who are 
invited can ascend to Jerusalem of the World to Come" ( B . BB 75b). At the same time, 
however, and in the same source, there is an alternate myth. Here, instead of bringing 
the heavenly Jerusalem down to earth at the time of the Redemption, it is said that 
God would elevate the earthly Jerusalem. Over time, the former myth of two Jerusalems 
became the dominant one, with the understanding that the heavenly Jerusalem would 
descend at the time of the Redemption.

536. THE CENTER OF THE WORLD 

The Land of Israel is the center of the world. Jerusalem is the center of the Land of Israel. 
The Temple is the center of Jerusalem. The Ark is the center of the Temple. The Founda- 
tion Stone stands before the Ark, and the entire world was founded upon it. The gate to 
heaven is there, and it is open. 

For God created the world in the same way a child is formed in the womb. Just as a 
child begins to grow from its navel, and then develops into its full form, so God began 
with the navel of the world, and from there expanded in all directions. Thus Jerusalem is 
the navel of the world, and its core is the altar of the Holy Temple, built upon the Foun- 
dation Stone, which forms the foundation of the world. 

On medieval maps Jerusalem is often shown as the center of the world, or, as it is 
often called, the navel of the world. This belief, supported by Ezekiel 5:5, derives both 
from the importance of Jerusalem and from the tradition of the Foundation Stone, 
upon which the world was built. See "The Foundation Stone," p. 96. The reference to 
the gate of heaven derives from Jacob's dream, This is none other than the abode of God, 
and that is the gateway to heaven (Gen. 28:17). 

Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael offers an alternate explanation of how the Land of Israel 
and Jerusalem were selected, in which God did not create the world around them, but 
they were chosen by God after the world was created: "Before the Land of Israel was 
chosen, all lands were suitable for divine revelation; after the Land of Israel was cho- 
sen, all other lands were eliminated. Before Jerusalem was selected, the entire Land of 
Israel was suitable for altars; after Jerusalem was selected, all the rest of the land was 
eliminated. Before the place of the Temple was selected, the whole of Jerusalem was 
appropriate for the manifestation of the Shekhinah; after the place of the Temple had 
been selected, the rest of Jerusalem was eliminated, as it is said. This is my resting-place 
for all time (Ps. 132:14)."

537. THE PATRIARCHS SEEK TO COMFORT JERUSALEM 

When Jerusalem was on fire and the Temple had been tom down, God said to Abraham, 
Go and comfort Jerusalem. Perhaps she will accept comforting from you." 

Abraham tried to comfort Jerusalem, but Jerusalem refused to be comforted. So God 
sent Isaac to comfort Jerusalem, and he fared no better than his father had done. Then 
God sent Jacob as he had Isaac, but Jerusalem would not be comforted. So God sent 
Moses on this mission, but still Jerusalem refused to be comforted. 

Thereupon all of the patriarchs went to God and said, "Jerusalem will not accept com- 
forting from any of us, so great is her grief." Then God said, "It is for Me to comfort 
Jerusalem. Since I set her on fire, I must comfort her." 

The model for a biblical figure comforting Israel is found in Jeremiah 31:15, where 
Jeremiah imagines or has a vision of Rachel weeping over the exile of her children, the 
children of Israel. This myth also finds a parallel in "God's Exile with Israel," p. 61. In 
that case God offered to raise any one of the patriarchs from the dead to lead Israel, 
but Israel refused all of them. So God agreed to lead them into exile Himself.

Pesikta Rabbati 30:3. 


538. THE CREATION OF THE TEMPLE 

At the beginning of the creation of the world, God foresaw that the Temple would be 
built, destroyed, and rebuilt. None shared in this secret, until God showed Jacob, asleep 
at Beth El, a vision of the Temple being built, destroyed and rebuilt again. 

Since King David desired to build a Temple to God, he entreated God to show him a 
place for the altar. So an angel appeared to him in a vision standing over the place in 
Jerusalem where the altar should be located. However, the angel commanded David not 
to build the Temple because he had been defiled with human blood through the many 
years he had spent fighting wars. The angel commanded him to turn the construction 
over to his son, Solomo n, but directed David himself to prepare the material needed for 
the construction — -gold, silver, copper, stones, cypress a nd cedar wood. This David did, 
and when the time*camelorSolomon to construct the Tfemple, the materials he needed to 
build it were already in his possession. 

Then King Solomon called everyone together — the rich and the poor, the princes and 
the priests— and he said: "People of Israel, let us build a splendid Temple in Jerusalem in 
honor of God. And since the Temple will be the holy place of all the people, all of the 
people should share in building it. Therefore you will cast lots to decide which wall you 
will build." 

So King Solomon prepared four lots. On one he wrote North, on another South, on the 
third East, and on the last West. Then he had each group choose one of them. In this way, 
it was decided that the princes would build the northern wall as well as the pillars and 
the stairs of the Temple. And the priests would build the southern wall and tend the Ark 



THE EARTHLY JERUSALEM 421 


and weave its curtain. As for the wealthy merchants, they were to build the eastern wall 
as well as supplying the oil that would bum for the Eternal Light. The job of building the 
western wall, as well as weaving the Temple's curtains, fell to the poor people, who also 
were to pray for the Temple's completion. Then the building began. 

The merchants took the golden jewelry of their wives and sold it to pay workers to 
build the wall for them, and soon it was finished. Likewise the princes and the priests 
found ways to have their walls built for them. But the poor people had to build the wall 
themselves, so it took them much longer. 

Every day the poor came to the site of the Temple, and they worked with their own 
hands to build the western wall. And all the time they worked on it, their hearts were 
filled with joy, for their love of God was very great. 

At last the Temple was finished, as beautiful as the Temple on high. Nothing in the 
world could compare with it, for it was the jewel in the crown of Jerusalem. And after 
that, whenever the poor people went to the Temple, fathers would say to their sons, "Do 
you see that stone in the wall? I put it there with my own hands." And mothers would 
say to their daughters, "Do you see that beautiful curtain in the Temple? I wove that 
curtain myself." 

Many years later, when the Temple was destroyed , only the Western Wall was sav ed, 
for the angels spread their wings over it. For that wall, built by the poor, was the most 
precious of all in the eyes of God. 

Even today the Western Wall is still standing. Now it is sometimes known as the Wail- 
ing Wall for_every morning drops of dew can be seen on its stones, and it is said among 
fhe people that the wall was crying at night for the Temple that was tom down. And, as 
everyone who has been there can testify, God's presence can still be felt in that place. 

Although King Solomon had the first Temple in Jerusalem built, the idea of creat- 
ing the Temple was said to have been King David's. But because of the blood on King 
David's hands, he was not considered pure enough by heaven to build the Temple. 
Therefore the responsibility fell on his son. King Solomon. The description of King 
David's role in conceiving the Temple comes from a fragment of Eupolemus. This is 
followed by a folktale about the building of the Temple. 

According to Zev Vilnay, the primary folklorist of the Land of Israel, he collected 
this story about the building of the Temple from a Jewish youth in Jerusalem in 1922. 

The point of the tale is that everyone participated in building the Temple, confirming 
its role as a temple of all the people.

539. THE TEMPLE BUILT ITSELF v 

• ^ 

It is said that no hammer or ax or any iron tool was heard in the Temple while it was being built 
( IKings 6:7). H ow, then, was the Temple built? The truth is that the Temple built itself. 
The stones flew and rose up by themselves. In this way the stones moved of their own 
accord and set themselves in the wall of the Temple and erected it. 

In this myth the existence of the Temple is so inevitable that it is said to have built 
itself. This corresponds with the traditions that there are earthly and heavenly Temples • 
that are mirror images of each other. Therefore the existence of the heavenly Temple 
was part of God's original plan.

422 MYTHS OF THE HOLY LAND 


540. THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE 

Everything came through for him in the construction. Foreign workmen brought the slabs 
of marble, cut to fit together. His fingers did the measuring, and the stones rose in place 
accordingly. Never did a building arise as easily as this Temple, or rather, this Temple arose 
as a Temple truly should. Only — on every stone (in what quarry had they originated?) was 
carved, with tools that must have been splendidly sharp, out of anger or to defile or to 
utterly destroy them, the crude scribblings of meaningless hands of children, or rather the 
markings of barbarous mountain dwellers, lasting an eternity that would survive the Temple. 

This is one of two parables Kafka wrote about the Temple. See "Leopards in the 
Temple, p. 423, for the other. This one about the building of the Temple is suggestive 
of the folklore about King Solomon, certainly the notion that "Everything came through 
him in the construction." 

While the parable has a universal quality, typical of Kafka, here the Temple can be 
recognized as the Temple built in Jerusalem. This is not quite as apparent in "Leop- 
ards in the Temple. If one views them together, however, it becomes evident that 
Kafka had focused on the Temple, certainly aware of its central importance in Jewish 
tradition. 

This motif is parallel to the rabbinic myth that the Temple built itself. See the pre- 
ceding entry, "The Temple Built Itself," p. 421.

541. THE WEDDING OF KING SOLOMON 
AND PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER 

King Solomon wed the daughter of Pharaoh on the same night he completed the build- 
ing of the Temple. That way the celebrations over the completion of the Temple and that 
over Solomon's wedding were held concurrently. But when the sound of the latter 
drowned out the sound of the former, the thought entered God's mind that some time in 
the future He would destroy the Temple, as it is said. This city has aroused My anger and My 
wrath from the day it was built until this day (Jer. 32:31). 

On the following morning the sacrifice was offered late. How did this happen? Bitiah 
had made a canopy on which she had affixed images of all kinds of stars and constella- 
tions, and she hung it over Solomon's wedding couch. So every time Solomon opened 
his eyes, he saw all those stars and constellations hanging over him, and thought it was 
still night. Then, too, God's anger was roused. 

Bitiah is the name usually attributed to the daughter of Pharaoh who raised Moses 
(although not in this source). The notion of Solomon and Pharaoh's daughter being 
wed is an example of midrashic time, in which all times blend together into one. While 
King Solomon may have married a daughter of the current ruler of Egypt, it was cer- 
tainly not Bitiah. 

The traditions related to Bitiah in her role in raising Moses treat her with great 
veneration, and prompted the rabbis to give her the name of Bitiah, "daughter of 
God. In fact, she is identified as one of the nine who entered Paradise alive ( Derekh 
Eretz Zuta 1). See "Pharaoh's Daughter," p. 374. However, in this account of the wed- 
ding of Solomon and Bitiah, there is a clear indication of disapproval, since Bitiah's 
canopy caused Solomon to be late in offering the morning sacrifice. 

God s anger is provoked when the rejoicing for Solomon's wedding drowns out 
that for the completion of the Temple. Likewise, God is angered when the morning 



THE EARTHLY JERUSALEM 423 


sacrifice is late because Solomon does not wake up in time. That Bitiah is somehow 
linked with these provocations is a clear indication that the notion of Solomon marry- 
ing Pharaoh's daughter did not receive rabbinic approval. This myth echoes God's 
anger at Solomon's tendency to follow other gods. See 1 Kings 11:1-10.

Midrash Mishlei 31. 


542. LEOPARDS IN THE TEMPLE 

Leopards break into the temple and drink the sacrificial vessels dry. It happens again and 
again. Eventually it can be predicted. It becomes a part of the ceremony. 

• 

Here Kafka creates a completely original temple myth, which itself is an explana- 
tion about the way that ritual comes into being predictable by repetition. Kafka wrote 
a number of parables that closely follow biblical and midrashic models. See "Para- 
dise, p. 445 and "The Coming of the Messiah," p. 518. Kafka also wrote parables on 
Abraham and Mount Sinai. 

Here, as is often the case, Kafka transforms the myth into a universal one, where it 
is no longer certain that the temple in Kafka's parable is the Temple in Jerusalem. 

An interesting parallel is IFA 16893, where lions enter a synagogue in Meron.

543. THE MYSTERY OF THE CHERUBIM 

As long as the people of Israel fulfilled the will of God, the faces of the cherubim on the 
curtain covering the Holy of Holies in the JTempl e were turned toward each other like 
those of a loving couple, indicating God'sTove for Israel. But Whert the people^oFlsrael 
did not obey the will of God, the cherubim turned their faces miraculously away from 
each other, toward the walls. 

Great mystery is associated with the two cherubim that were said to be sculpted on 
the cover of the Ark in the Temple in Jerusalem. They were believed to be enchanted, 
as demonstrated in this myth, where they are said to face each other like a loving 
couple if Israel fulfilled God's will and to turn away if Israel did not. For more on the 
role of the cherubim, see "The Ever-turning Sword of Flame," p. 404. The earliest ref- 
erence to the cherubim is found in Genesis 3:24, where God places them at the gates of 
Eden. That passage does not indicate their sex, but the description of the cherubim on 
the Ark cover in the Holy of Holies implies that of a couple, and some sexual element 
is assumed. This is made very explicit in the talmudic tradition in B. Yoma 54a: "When- 
ever Israel came to the Temple for the Festival, the curtain would be removed and the 
Cherubim were shown to them, whose bodies were intertwined with one another, 
and they would be addressed: 'Look! You are beloved before God as the love between 
man and woman." This almost certainly refers to the uniting of God's masculine and 
f eminine aspects . When there is harmony between GcftTand Israel, these aspects are irT 
'narmony, but when there isn't harmony, the forces of exile predominate above and 
below. These notions were much further elaborated on in kabbalah, where the separa- 
tion of God's masculine and feminine aspects is portrayed as the exile of the Shekhinah.

424 MYTHS OF THE HOLY LAND 


544. GOD'S JUDGMENT ABOVE AND BELOW 

When God decided to destroy the Temple in Jerusalem, He first put aside the Holy Land 
above, the supernal city of Jerusalem, and cut it off from the sacred heavens that served 
as its nourishment. Seeing this, the angels wept bitterly, for it meant that the Shekhinah 
had been sent into exile. These are the ways of God. When He wishes to judge the world. 
He first passes judgment on the world above, and only then does He pass judgment on 
the world below. 

Nor was the Shekhinah the only one in heaven to suffer. Even God suffered a change 
from what He was before— His light no longer shone. That is because blessings exist only 
where male and female are together. 

So it was that from the day the Temple was destroyed, the heavens did not shine with 
their usual light. Nor will the light of the heavens be restored until the End of Days, when 
the Bride and Groom shall dwell together again as one. 

Most myths about the Temple of God in the heavenly Jerusalem emphasize its eter- 
nal nature, in stark contrast to the earthly Temple, which was destroyed. But this myth 
is different, claiming that God cut off the heavenly Temple from the source of its nour- 
ishment. Isaiah Tishby identifies the Holy Land above not only with the Temple, but 
more specifically with the Shekhinah, suggesting that this myth from the Zohar is more 
of a myth about the exile of the Shekhinah than about the heavenly Jerusalem. 

Zohar 1:182a provides a prooftext for the necessity of male and female to be to- 
gether in order for blessings to exist: Male and female He created them and blessed them 
(Gen. 5:2). This emphasizes the heavenly parallels to the human condition, again un- 
derscoring the central kabbalistic tenet of "as above, so below."

545. GOD'S CLEANSING OF THE HOLY LAND 

From the day the Temple in Jerusalem was tom down, the Land of Israel has been broken 
down because of the wickedness of those who dwelt there, its holiness in exile. That is 
why, in the Days to Come, God will take hold of the corners of the land and shake it free 
from all unclean things, as it is said. To seize the comers of the earth and shake the wicked out 
of it Job 38:13). 


Here the Land of Israel is portrayed as being under some kind of curse, brought on 
when the Temple, the center of holiness in all the land, was destroyed. Although this 
is a rabbinic myth, no later than the eighth century, the notion that the Land of Israel 
was under a curse parallels the later kabbalistic notion of the kelippot, the shards of the 
shattered vessels in the myth of the Ari to which demonic forces cling. These forces of 
evil cling to the shards very tightly, and are hard to dislodge. However, they will meet 
their final defeat in the End of Days, the messianic era. This results in the same kind of 
purification as portrayed in this myth of God cleansing the Holy Land.

THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TEMPLE 425 


546. THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TEMPLE 

As long as the Shekhinah dwelled in the Temple, it could not be destroyed. But as the sins 
of Israel increased, the Shekhinah gradually withdrew from the Holy of Holies, leaving 
the Temple and the holy city of Jerusalem unprotected. Some say that after withdrawing 
from the Temple, the Shekhinah dwelt on the Mount of Olives for thirteen years before 
She returned to Her place on high. Jeremiah is said to have seen Her there. 

After Jeremiah left Jerusalem, the Angel of the Lord came down from heaven, set his 
feet against the walls of Jerusalem, and breached them. Then the angel cried out, "Let the 
enemies come and enter the House, for the Master is no longer within. Let them despoil 
and destroy it. Let them go into the vineyard and cut down the vines, for the Watchman 
has gone away and left it." 

When the Temple was destroyed, five things were hidden that have never been seen 
again: the Ark, the menorah, the fires, the Holy Spirit, and the cherubim. They will re- 
main hidden until the Temple is rebuilt. Then God will return them to their places and 
make Jerusalem joyous. So too, in the future, when the Temple will be raised up and 
renewed, its gates that are buried in the earth will all arise, every one in its place. 

Jewish tradition holds that the Temple could not have been destroyed without God's 
concurrence. Indeed, the Angel of the Lord, sent at God's behest, is the one who 
breaches the wall, not the Roman army. So too does the angel invite the enemies to 
destroy the Temple because God, the Master, is gone. Thus the understanding that 
God had turned His face away from His people at that time. This is confirmed in the 
confrontation between God and the Shekhinah , as recounted in Zohar 1 :202b-203a, where 
the Bride of God accuses Her spouse, God, of destroying Her home, i.e., the Temple, 
and sending Her children, Israel, into exile. See "The Exile of the Shekhinah ," p. 57. 

An interesting variant to this myth is found in Eikhah Zuta and Yalkut Shim'oni, 
where God states that "As long as I am in the Temple, the nations of the world cannot 
harm it. Therefore I shall avert My eye from it, and shall foreswear all involvement 
with it until the End of Days. And the enemies shall enter it and destroy it." According 
to this myth, it was at that very hour that the enemy entered the Temple court and set 
it aflame. 

Zohar 1:26b traces the destruction of the first and second Temples to Adam's sin of 
eating from the Tree of Knowledge. This demonstrates the link between the Fall and 
the destruction of the Temple in Jewish mythic consciousness. Both are regarded as 
cosmic catastrophes of equal importance. However, the same source in the Zohar also 
links the destruction of the two temples to the breaking of the two tablets that Moses 
brought down from Mount Sinai. It explains that because the people were under the 
domination of the Angel of Death, the tablets that derived from the Tree of Life broke 
and fell. 

Not all myths agree that God played an active role in the destruction of the Temple. 

Some sources attribute its destruction to the Yetzer ha-Ra, the Evil Inclination. B. Sukkah 
52a states that the Yetzer ha-Ra set its eyes on the first Temple and destroyed it, and 
killed the Torah scholars who were in it. So too did the Yetzer ha-Ra set its eyes on the 
second Temple and destroy it, and killed the Torah scholars who were in it. In these 
cases the Evil Inclination plays a role similar to that of the Evil Eye, which casts an evil 
spell on whatever it gazes upon. Other myths attribute the desire to harm the Temple 
to the demons, who sought to sabotage the building of the Temple in several ways. 

This is found in the frame story to The Testament of Solomon, where the demons, feeling 
that King Solomon and his chief builder were too powerful to bring down, instead 
sent the demon Ornasis to harm the son of the chief builder, hoping to harm Solomon 
that way. See "The Vampire Demon," p. 227.

547. A STONE FROM MOUNT SINAI 

All the stones used in the building of the Temple in Jerusalem were from Jerusalem and 
its mountains. Only one stone was brought from somewhere else — from Mount Sinai. It 
was put in the Kotel, the Western Wall of the Temple. And that is why only the Kotel was 
not destroyed and remained standing when the Temple was destroyed, because that stone 
was from the holy mountain on which the Torah was given. 

Jewish tradition recounts that the Kotel the retaining wall of the Temple Mount, 
was the only wall of the Temple to survive the destruction of the Temple. Here an 
explanation is offered for its survival— it contained one stone from Mount Sinai. Thus 
the holiness of that mountain, contained within a single stone, is credited for saving 
the one surviving wall of the Temple.

548. THE HAND OF GOD 

The Temple in Jerusalem had been set aflame, and the moment of destruction had ar- 
rived. The High Priest went up to the roof, the keys of the Temple in his hand. There he 
called out: "Master of the Universe! The time has come to return these keys to You." Then 
he threw the keys high into the air, and at that instant a hand reached down from above 
and caught them, and brought them back into heaven. 

The destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem brought an era of Jewish life to an end. 

None of the rituals connected to the Temple could be performed any longer. Therefore 
this talmudic legend recounts how the High Priest returned the keys to the Temple to . 
God, and in a strongly anthropomorphic image, a giant hand reaches down from 
heaven to retrieve them. The theological implications of this legend are considerable. 

It presumes that heaven was both well aware of the destruction of the Temple, and 
that it was no accident, but was God's intention. Of course, it also is a tragic event. 

From this perspective, the act of the High Priest in returning the keys to heaven is one 
of great despair. Nevertheless, even at this tragic moment in Jewish history, the link 
between God and His people, Israel, remains intact in the act of God accepting the 
keys to the Temple. The motif of returning a precious gift to heaven is found in the 
talmudic tale of Rabbi Haninah ben Dosa returning the leg of a golden table to heaven 
(B. Tan. 24b-25a) and "The Soul of the Ari" in Gabriels Palace , pp. 258-259. In 2 Baruch 
the High Priest casts the temple vessels to the earth, which opens, swallowing them 
up.

THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TEMPLE 427 


549. GOD'S MOURNING 

When the Temple was destroyed, God tore His garment as a sign of mourning. Since 
then, God cries every day for the glory that has been taken from the Jews. 

Once Rabbah bar Bar Hannah went to Mount Sinai and heard a voice call out of heaven: 
"Woe to Me that I have vowed that the Jews must go into exile. Now that I have vowed, 
who will annul My vow?" 

When Rabbah reported this to the other rabbis, they said, "Fool! You should have said, 
'Your vow is void/" 

Here the wandering sage Rabbah bar Bar Hannah hears God mourning over the 
destruction of the Temple. God laments that He took a vow to destroy the Temple and 
now there was no way to annul it. The rabbis tell Rabbah that he should have called 
out "Mufar lakh/' meaning "your vow or oath is void," the formula used by an autho- 
rized person for annulling vows and oaths.

550. THE PATRIARCHS WEEP OVER THE 
DESTRUCTION OF THE TEMPLE 

After the Temple had been destroyed, God said to Jeremiah, "Go, summon Abraham, 
Isaac, Jacob from their graves. They know how to weep." 

So Jeremiah went to the cave of Machpelah, where the patriarchs are buried, and raised 
them from their graves and brought them up to heaven, where they prayed before God: 
"Master of the Universe, how long will You sit on Your throne like a mourner? Are You 
not going to have mercy on Your children? Are You not going to show compassion?" 

In that hour God replied to them: "Abraham, My friend, Isaac, My chosen one, and 
Jacob, My firstborn, I cannot now save them from their exile." 

Then the angel Michael, the Prince of Israel, wept in a loud voice, " Why, O Lord , do You 
stand aloof ' (Ps. 10:1)? 


Here God summons the patriarchs from their graves, and they, in turn, beg God for 
compassion for Israel. But when God puts them off, the angel Michael, Prince of Is- 
rael, cries out to God in despair. This demonstrates that all of the powers of heaven 
are deeply concerned about the fate of Israel. God initiates this confrontation by sum- 
moning the patriarchs, which is a reflection of His own guilt at the destruction of the 
Temple. Most telling of all is Michael's cry of despair, since angels are primarily mes- 
sengers of God and obey God's commands. But here Michael's cry borders on chal- 
lenging God's decision not to save Israel from exile. 

The references to Abraham as God's friend, Isaac as God's chosen one, and Jacob as 
God's firstborn are a reworking of Isaiah 41:8: " But you , Israel , My servant , Jacob whom 
I have chosen , the seed of Abraham, my friend." The changes in the text are significant, 
especially the identification of Jacob as God's firstborn — while the verse in Isaiah says, 
" Jacob whom I have chosen," suggests that this myth may be linked to the tendency of 
some to give Jacob virtually divine status. See "Jacob the Divine," p. 366.

428 MYTHS OF THE HOLY LAND 


551. ABRAHAM IN THE TEMPLE 

When the Temple was destroyed, God found Abraham standing in the ruins of the Temple. 
He said to him, "Why should My beloved be in My house ?" (Jer. 11:15). 

Abraham replied, "I have come concerning the fate of my children." 

God said, "Your children sinned and have been sent into exile." 

"Perhaps," said Abraham, "they only sinned in error." 

God answered, " She has wrought lewdness " (Jer. 11:15). 

Abraham said, "Perhaps only a few sinned?" 

" With many " (Jer. 11:15), came the reply. 

"Still," Abraham pleaded, "You should have remembered the covenant of the circum- 
cision." 

God replied, " The sacral flesh has passed from you " (Jer. 11:15). 

"In that case," said Abraham, "perhaps if You had waited for them, they would have 
repented." 

God replied, " For you exult while performing your evil deedsl" (Jer. 11:15). 

Then Abraham put his hands on his head and wept bitterly and cried, "Perhaps, heaven 
forbid, there is no hope for them." 

Then a heavenly voice came forth and said, " The Lord named you verdant olive tree, fair, 
with choice fruit (Jer. 11:16). As the olive tree produces its best only at the very end, so 
Israel will flourish at the end of time." 

Here Abraham confronts God over the destruction of the Temple and the exile of 
the children of Israel, and proceeds to bargain with God as he did over the fate of 
Sodom (Gen. 18:22-33). God's replies are taken from Jeremiah 11:15-16. Although God 
does not reverse His decree against the Jews, a heavenly voice holds out the promise 
that in the end Israel will flourish. 

A related midrash is found in Lamentations Kabbah, Proem 24. See "Abraham and 
the Alphabet," following. 

Sources: 

B . Menahot 53b. 


552. ABRAHAM AND THE ALPHABET 

God said to Abraham, "Your children have sinned and transgressed against the whole 
Torah, all twenty-two letters in it. Let the letters of the alphabet testify against Israel." All 
at once the twenty-two letters appeared. The aleph came forth to testify that Israel had 
transgressed the Torah. 

Abraham said to the aleph, "You are the first of all the letters, and you have come to 
testify against Israel in its time of danger? Have you forgotten that God opened the Ten 
Commandments with you and that every nation turned you down except for the chil- 
dren of Israel, and you have come to testify against them?" 

The aleph immediately stood aside and gave no testimony. Then the bet came to testify 
against Israel. 

"My daughter," Abraham said to the bet, "have you come to testify against My chil- 
dren who cling to the Torah, of which you are the first letter, as it is said. In the beginning 
God created (Gen. 1:1)? 

The bet quickly stood aside and gave no testimony. 

When the remaining letters saw how the aleph and bet had been silenced, they felt 
ashamed and did not testify. Abraham then began to speak before God, saying, "Master 



THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TEMPLE 429 


of the Universe, when I was a hundred years old You gave me a son. When he was a 
young man you ordered me to offer him as a sacrifice before You. I steeled my heart and 
bound him on the altar myself. Will You not remember this on my behalf and have mercy 
on my children?" 

At this the mercy of God was stirred, and He said, "For your sake and that of your 
children I will restore Israel to their place." 


Here Abraham intercedes with God to spare Israel from condemnation. This is 
condensed from a longer myth in which not only Abraham, but Isaac, Jacob, and Moses 
all come before God to defend Israel. Finally the matriarch Rachel breaks her silence 
and tells of her suffering when Jacob was given in marriage to her sister, Leah, instead 
of to herself. God's heart is softened, and this myth then identifies Rachel's plea with 
the verse Rachel weeping for her children (Jer. 31:15).

Lamentations Rabbah , Proem 24. 


553. MOSES AND THE SUN 

When Moses learned that the Temple in Jerusalem had been destroyed and the people 
killed or taken into exile, he lifted up his voice, saying: "Cursed be you, sun! Why did 
you not become dark when the enemy entered the Temple?" 

The sun replied: "By your life, Moses, how could I become dark when they beat me 
with sixty whips of fire, saying, 'Go pour forth your light! I had no choice/" 

At that Moses spoke to God, saying, "Master of the Universe, You have written in Your 
Torah, No animal from the herd or from the flock shall be slaughtered on the same day with its 
young (L gv^22:28 ). Yet many mothers and sons have been killed. Why are You silent?" 

Here Moses confronts first the sun — the earliest primitive symbol of God — and 
then God Himself over their failure to prevent the destruction of the Temple. There is 
substantial anger revealed, which, of course, is actually the anger of the rabbis, the 
authors of these myths. Abraham is not afraid to question or bargain with God, as was 
demonstrated in the case of Sodom (Gen. 18:22-33). But Moses has such an intimate 
relationship with God, and such an intense interest in the fate of his people, Israel, 
that he can even confront God as he did in Exodus 32:9-14, and as he does here.

554. THE INVISIBLE TEMPLE 

It only appears that the Temple was destroyed. Actually, it remains in existence, hidden 
from the sight of ordinary mortals, and sacrifices are still offered in the invisible sanctuary. 

This is an unusual variant on the theme that the heavenly Temple continues to 
exist although the earthly Temple was destroyed. Here the earthly Temple is still said 
to exist, although it is invisible, and we are told that sacrifices are still offered there. 

There are other examples of invisible things found in Jewish lore. For example, some 
versions of the myth of the primordial light say that it was never removed from the 
world, but is visible only to the Tzaddikim. See "The Light of the First Day," p. 83.

MYTHS OF EXILE 



The serpent came to Eve when she was alone and 
possessed her and infused her with lust. That is how 
the serpent fathered Cain. 


Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 




EXILE FROM EDEN 


555. THE EXILE FROM EDEN 

Now the serpent was the shrewdest of all the wild beasts that the Lord God had made. 
He said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?'" 
The woman replied to the serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the other trees of the 
garden. It is only about fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that God said, 'You 
shall not eat of it or touch it, lest you die.'" And the serpent said to the woman, "You are 
not going to die, but God knows that as soon as you eat of it your eyes will be opened and 
you will be like divine beings who know good and bad." When the woman saw that the 
tree was good for eating and a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable as a 
source of wisdom, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave some to her husband, and he 
ate. Then the eyes of both of them were opened and they perceived that they were naked; 
and they sewed together fig leaves and made themselves loincloths. 

They heard the sound of the Lord God moving about in the garden at the breezy time 
of day; and the man and his wife hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden. 
The Lord God called out to the man and said to him, "Where are you?" He replied, "I 
heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid." 
Then He asked, "Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat of the tree from which 
I had forbidden you to eat?" The man said, "The woman You put at my side — she gave 
me of the tree, and I ate." And the Lord God said to the woman, "What is this you have 
done!" The woman replied, "The serpent duped me, and I ate." Then the Lord God said 
to the serpent, "Because you did this, more cursed shall you be than all the cattle and all 
the wild beasts: On your belly shall you crawl and dirt shall you eat all the days of your 
life. I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and 
hers; they shall strike at your head, and you shall strike at their heel." 

And to the woman He said, "I will make most severe your pangs in childbearing; in 
pain shall you bear children. Yet your urge shall be for your husband, and he shall rule 
over you." 

To Adam He said, "Because you did as your wife said and ate of the tree about which 
I commanded you, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed be the ground because of you; by toil 
shall you eat of it all the days of your life: thorns and thistles shall it sprout for you. But 
your food shall be the grasses of the field; by the sweat of your brow shall you get bread 
to eat, until you return to the ground — for from it you were taken. For dust you are, and 
to dust you shall return." 

The man named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all the living. And the 
Lord God made garments of skins for Adam and his wife, and clothed them. 

And the Lord God said, "Now that the man has become like one of us, knowing good 
and bad, what if he should stretch out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, 
and live forever!" So the Lord God banished him from the garden of Eden, to till the soil 
from which he was taken. He drove the man out, and stationed east of the Garden of 
Eden the cherubim and the fiery ever-turning sword, to guard the way to the tree of life. 

Along with the story of Creation in Genesis, this is probably the most famous bib- 
lical myth of all. Not only is it the first of the divine tests, but it provides an explana- 
tion for mortality and a justification for patriarchy. While Judaism does not include 
original sin among the consequences of Adam's disobedience, the failure of Adam 
and Eve to heed God's warning not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge is regarded in 
Jewish tradition as a cosmic catastrophe, equal to the Shattering of the Vessels in the 
myth of the Ari, or to the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. 

Above all, the story of the exile from Eden is a story of sin and punishment, and 
establishes a negative pattern in the relationship of God and His human creations. 


433 



434 MYTHS OF EXILE 


At the same time, the story can be read as an allegory of innocence lost, where 
Adam and Eve are like children while they live in the Garden of Eden, and their ex- 
pulsion from Eden, which takes place at the time of their loss of sexual innocence, 
represents the emergence into adulthood. 

Some sources describe other consequences of the Fall that are not found in Genesis. 
Just as Adam and Eve suffered great losses and punishments from the sin of the Fall, 
so the animals lost their language. For, according to Josephus, all living things in the 
Garden of Eden spoke the same language ( Antiquities 1:41), and The Book of Jubilees 
repeats this tradition, adding that "on the day when Adam went out of the Garden of 
Eden . . . the mouths of all the beasts and cattle and birds and whatever walked or 
moved was stopped from speaking" (Jubilees 3:27-28). There is an indication that even 
the world of vegetation was affected. According to 3 Baruch, God cursed the tree of 
sinful desire that the evil angel Satanel had planted, for that tree was the cause of the 
Fall (3 Baruch, Slavonic, 4:8). This refers to the Tree of Knowledge, here linked to car- 
nal knowledge. 

An intriguing parallel to this myth of eating the forbidden fruit is that of Pandora 
in Greek myth, who set free the evil spirits locked up in a jar (not a box) and released 
evil into the world. The jar contained all the Spites that plague mankind: Old Age, 
Labor, Sickness, Insanity, Vice, and Passion, and as they flew out in a cloud they stung 
Epimetheus, Pandora's husband, and Pandora all over her body. See Graves, The Greek 
Myths 39j, 39.8. See also Hesiod's Works and Days 42-105, and Theogony 565-619.

556. EVE TASTES THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT 

God told Adam, Of every tree of the garden you are free to eat; but as for the tree of knowledge 
of good and bad, you must not eat of it; for as soon as you eat of it, you shall die" (Gen. 2:16-17). 
But Adam told Eve, "God has said, 'You shall not eat of it or touch it, lest you die'" (Gen. 3:3). 

At that time the serpent said to himself, "Perhaps I cannot convince Adam, who heard 
the words of God for himself. So I will seek out Eve." 

The serpent found Eve in the garden and said, "Is it true that God has commanded 
you not to eat of any fruit in the garden?" Eve replied, "No, there is only one tree in the 
midst of the garden forbidden to us. We are not allowed to eat of its fruit or even to touch 
it, for on that day we shall die." 

The serpent laughed when he heard this, and said, "God has only said this out of 
jealousy, for He knows that if you eat of the fruit of that tree, your eyes will be opened, 
and you will know how to create a world just as He did." Then the serpent went to the 
tree in the midst of the garden and shook it, so that some of the fruit fell to the ground. 
"See, I have touched the tree and I have not died. You, too, can touch it without dying." 

When Eve saw the serpent touch the tree and not die, she picked up one of the fruits 
that had fallen and, seeing that it was beautiful and desirable, she tasted it. But no sooner 
had she taken a single bite, than her teeth were set on edge, and she saw the Angel of 
Death standing before her, with his sword drawn. Then Eve said to herself, "Now that I 
have eaten of this fruit, I will die, and Adam, who has not touched it, will live forever, 
and God will couple him with another woman. It is better that we die together." 



EXILE FROM EDEN 435 


So when Adam came she gave him some of the fruit to taste. And as soon as he did, he 
too saw the Angel of Death standing before him, with sword drawn. Then Adam knew 
that the fruit she had given him must have been the forbidden fruit, and he was filled 
with grief. 

Others say that the serpent did not wait for Eve to touch the tree, but pushed her 
against it and said, "See, you have not died. And just as you didn't die from touching the 
tree, so you will not die from eating its fruit." So Eve plucked the fruit and held it up and 
tasted its skin. When nothing happened, she bit into the fruit, and that is when she saw 
the Angel of Death. 

This myth grows out of rabbinic awareness of a problem in the biblical text where 
God warns Adam against eating the forbidden fruit (Gen. 2:16-17), but Eve tells the 
serpent that they are forbidden to eat from it or touch it (Gen. 3:3). The rabbis as- 
sumed that Adam had added on his own, a warning against touching the fruit. (After 
all. Eve had not been created when God gave Adam the original warning.) The myth 
assumes that the serpent is aware of Adam's additional warning, and uses this knowl- 
edge to convince Eve to eat the forbidden fruit. In one version, he does this by push- 
ing Eve against the Tree of Knowledge, then pointing out that while she has touched 
it, she has not died. Therefore she might as well eat the fruit, which she does. 

In most versions of this myth. Eve sees the Angel of Death the instant she bites into 
the forbidden fruit. But in Targum Pseudo-Yonathan on Gen. 3:6, Eve sees that the wicked 
angel Samael, one of the names of Satan, was himself the Angel of Death.

557. GOD DIVORCED ADAM 

When God drove Adam out of the Garden of Eden, He gave Adam a get, a bill of divorce, 
as it is said. He drove the man out (Gen. 3:24). After that, they went their separate ways. 
God withdrew from His earthly domicile and dwelt on high, and Adam struggled to 
bring forth food from the earth. 

Here God's sending Adam into exile is interpreted to mean that God divorced Him- 
self of Adam, and gave Adam a get , a bill of divorce. A woman receives a get at the 
conclusion of the divorce proceedings. Then, just as a divorced couple go their sepa- 
rate ways, God separated Himself further from Adam by ascending on high. The bib- 
lical verse usually translated as He drove Adam out is here understood to mean instead 
that God separated Himself from Adam, and formalized their separation by giving 
Adam a get. 

This myth reads like a metaphor that has become literal. After all, God and Adam 
were not married. But in the view of the rabbis, the separation between them was as 
final as a divorce. Thus the concept of a get , a bill of divorce, is expanded here to 
include the kind of contractual relationship found between God and Adam. Accord- 
ing to that contract, Adam was permitted to live in the garden, as long as he did not 
eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. This myth also conveys the gulf of separation 
created between God and Adam at the time of the exile from Eden. 

Other rabbinic texts also portray the Fall as a major event in the history of the uni- 
verse, a cosmic catastrophe. Both are intended to convey the radical transformation of 



436 MYTHS OF EXILE 


the nature of existence after this cosmos-shaking event. In fact, it is precisely parallel to 
two other cosmic catastrophes: the Shattering of the Vessels in the myth of the Ari and 
the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. 

The majority of rabbinic references to the events of the Fall single out Adam and do 
not mention Eve. While this may be a form of shorthand, it also leads to the kind of 
pairing of God and Adam found here. 

While this myth describes the bill of divorce between God and Adam, "The Wed- 
ding of God and Israel," p. 305, describes the Torah as a ketubah, a wedding contract, 
between God and His people.

558. ADAM'S DIAMOND 

While Adam lived in the Garden of Eden, he could have anything he wanted, with, of 
course, one exception— the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. So when Adam sinned and it 
was necessary for God to expel him from the garden, God was reluctant to drive him out. 
Instead God gave Adam a good meal, with the finest foods and wines, and God said, 
"You know, there is a world outside this garden. Don't you want to explore it?" Adam 
didn't really want to go, but God said, "You can take anything you like with you, what- 
ever you desire, but you must go." Then God showed him all the treasures and hidden 
things in the garden, and Adam looked at everything, gardens and orchards, animals of 
every kind, treasures of gold and silver, and many kinds of precious stones, but Adam 
didn't find anything he wanted to take with him. Then he arrived at a treasure of dia- 
monds. The diamonds were exceptionally beautiful and shone as brightly as the sun, and 
Adam chose one of the largest ones. 

Holding that diamond in his hand, Adam went in the direction of the gates of Eden, 
with an angel accompanying him. He passed through the gates, and when he looked 
behind him he saw the cherubim with the flaming sword and he realized he could not go 
back. For a moment he was sorry, then he continued on his way until he reached a river. 
While he was standing there looking at it, the angel pushed him from behind, and the 
diamond fell from his hand into the river. Adam cried out to the angel, "Why did you do 
that?" And the angel said, "Go down to the river and find your diamond." 

So Adam went down to the river and saw thousands and thousands of diamonds 
reflected in the water and he couldn't recognize which one was his. Then the angel said, 
"Do you think that you were the first one who was expelled from the Garden of Eden and 
took a diamond with you? Thousands and thousands did as you did, and their diamonds 
fill the river, as you can see." 

This unusual folktale may be based on the midrashic tradition about the Tzohar , 
the jewel said to have been given to Adam when he was expelled from the Garden of 
Eden. However, this story takes the motif of the diamond in a different direction. Here 
Adam loses the diamond in a river after being pushed by an angel, and discovers that 
the river is full of diamonds as precious as his own. The angel reveals that he was not 
the first to be expelled from Eden and take a diamond with him. 

While there is an extensive rabbinic tradition that God created prior worlds before 
this one, and destroyed them, the notion that God created human beings before Adam, 
who also sinned and were expelled from the Garden of Eden, is entirely original. This 
story demonstrates the rich Jewish oral tradition, where variations of traditional tales 
evolve in unexpected ways. 



EXILE FROM EDEN 437 


Note Eve's absence from this story. In many of the myths about Adam, Eve is missing. 
It seems fitting that such a mythic folktale would come from Afghanistan — a bitter 
parable of exile, how one doesn't appreciate one's homeland until it is gone. 

See "The Tzohar ," p. 85 and "Prior Worlds," p. 71. For a modem story on the same 
theme, see "The Experimental World" in The Marriage Feast by Par Lagerkvist, pp. 53-54.

559. THE GARMENTS OF ADAM AND EVE 

When Adam and Eve were first created, they were clothed, body and soul, with gar- 
ments of light. Some say those garments of light were made entirely of clouds of glory. 
Others say they were made of holy luminous letters that God had given them, which 
shed radiance like a torch, broad at the bottom and narrow at the top. 

After Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, the garments of light were replaced by 
garments of skins, as it is said. And the Lord God made garments of skins for Adam and his 
wife , and clothed them (Gen. 3:21). It is said that these garments were created during twi- 
light on the sixth day of Creation, just before the first Sabbath. Some say that they con- 
sisted of a hornlike substance, smooth as a fingernail and as beautiful as a jewel, while 
others say that they were made of goats 7 skin or the wool of camels. Still others insist that 
they were made of the hide of the serpent who led them astray in the Garden of Eden. 

Adam handed down the garments to Seth, and Seth to Methuselah, and Methuselah 
to Noah, who took them with him on the ark. And when they left the ark. Ham, the son 
of Noah, bequeathed them to Nimrod, although others say that Nimrod stole them. When 
Nimrod wore Adam's garments, his outward appearance was that of Adam, and the 
creatures were humbled before him and would bow down, thinking he was their king. 

The garments came into the possession of Esau when he defeated Nimrod, and it was 
this garment that Jacob wore when he went to his father, Isaac. For that day Esau had not 
put them on, so that they remained in the house. Rebecca then took the best clothes of her 
older son Esau , which were there in the house , and had her younger son Jacob put them on (Gen. 
27:15). Isaac smelled the smell of Esau's garments, and therefore he blessed Jacob. 

Some say that the repentance of Adam and Eve earned a different set of garments for 
them, garments of light. At the End of Days, God will dress the Messiah in such a gar- 
ment, which will shine from one end of the world to the other. And the Jews will draw 
upon its light and say to the Messiah, "Blessed is the hour in which the Messiah was 
created." 


This is an example of what might be called a "chain midrash," because it links 
together the chain of the generations, from Adam until the Messiah. Other similar 
midrashic traditions are found about the staff of Moses, the book that the angel Raziel 
is said to have given Adam, and the glowing stone known as the Tzohar. Sometimes 
there are contradictory lines of descent, as in the case of Adam's garment. According 
to one account in Midrash Tanhuma, the garment was diverted into the hands of the 
evil king Nimrod, while in an opposing account, it was transferred from Noah to 
Shem to Abraham, who passed it down to Isaac. Isaac is said to have given it to Esau, 
his firstborn, but Esau entrusted it to his mother, Rebecca, when he saw his own wives 
practiced idolatry. And, as is reported in the biblical account, Rebecca took the be- 
loved garments of her son Esau and gave them to Jacob, at the time he received the 
stolen blessing. 

According to Sefer ha-Zikhronot, the garments of Adam and Eve were among eight 
things created on the first day of Creation. Other sources describe them as being created

at twilight on the sixth day of Creation. As is apparent, (here were alternate explanations 
about the nature of the garments of Adam and Eve. Genesis 3:21 seems to clearly state that 
they were made of the skins of animals, while in the midrash they are also described as 
consisting of a hornlike substance. The notion that their original garments were made of 
light derives from the word or, which when spelled with an aleph means "light," while 
when spelled with an uyin means "skin" as well as "leather." It is spelled with an ayin in 
Genesis 3:21, but Genesis Rabbah 20:12 states that in the Torah scroll of Rabbi Meir, the or in 
the biblical verse was written with an aleph. Zohar 2:229b explains that they were origi- 
nally garments of light, not of skin, for when Adam was about to enter the Garden of Eden 
for the first time, God dressed him in garments of light, of the sort used by the angels in 
paradise. Indeed, the light of Adam's garments was more elevated than their own. Had 
he not been wearing those garments, Adam could not have entered the garden. And when 
he was driven out of Eden, he required different garments, so the Lord made garments of 
skins for Adam and his wife, and clothed them (Gen. 3:21). 

A variant of this myth has Noah's son, Shem, giving the garments to Abraham, 
who wears them when he takes Isaac to Mount Moriah to be sacrificed. Later they 
were inherited by Isaac, who gave them to his firstborn son, Esau. These were the 
garments Jacob put on when he pretended to be Esau in order to receive his father's 
blessing. Thus when Jacob entered the room, Isaac smelled the fragrance that he had 
smelled when he was tied upon the altar. 

Rabbi Tzadok ha-Kohen of Lublin (1823-1900) proposes that the sin of Adam and 
Eve, followed by their repentance, brought them to a more exalted state than before 
the sin, symbolized by their receiving new garments, replacing the garments of skin 
with garments of light. This is a surprising view of the role of sin and repentance in 
stimulating spiritual growth. Rabbi Yosef Hayim of Baghdad, known as Ben Ish Hai, 
asserts in Ben Yehoyada that Torah study has the power to reverse the process, chang- 
ing garments of skins back into garments of ligh t

560. ADAM'S DESCENDANTS 

God created the world and set it on its foundation. Then He created Adam and brought 
him into the world to find contentment in him and his descendants until the end of gen- 
erations. But among Adam's descendants some worshipped the sun and moon, others 
worshipped wood and stone, and every day God lost patience with them, until He deemed 
that they were deserving of annihilation. 

Nevertheless, after considering that they were the work of His hands, God said, "These 
humans have life, and so do the other creatures. These have breath and those have breath. 
These have a desire for food and drink and those have a desire for food and drink. Humans 
must be at least as important as the beasts and creeping things I created upon the earth." 

At once God felt some measure of contentment and resolved not to annihilate human- 
kind. 



EXILE FROM EDEN 439 


This myth presents God's view of humanity through two lenses: the lens of justice 
and that of mercy. From the view of strict justice, humankind, who has failed to recog- 
nize God's role and instead has various kinds of pagan worship, deserves annihilation. 
But from the perspective of mercy, humans are simply one of the kinds of creatures that 
God created. It is this merciful view that wins out over that of strict justice, and God 
resolves — thus makes an oath with Himself — not to annihilate humankind. And even 
though God comes close to doing this in the time of the Flood, God does spare Noah 
and his family, who repopulate the earth. From the perspective of this myth, sparing 
Noah was an act of God's mercy, despite the harshness of the Flood. 

While God's views of humanity are interpreted in terms of justice and mercy, they 
also portray God as somewhat at the mercy of His moods, sometimes gripped by fury 
great enough to annihilate mankind, and at other times behaving like a loving parent, 
concerned about His own creations.

561. GOD DESCENDS INTO THE GARDEN 

No sooner did Adam taste the forbidden fruit than the angel Gabriel blew a trumpet and 
summoned all the angels. When Adam and Eve heard the trumpet, they knew that God 
was about to come into the Garden to judge them. 

Then God set out on His Chariot driven by cherubs, with angels praising Him. Adam 
and Eve were afraid, and hid. As soon as God reached the Garden, all the plants of the 
Garden flowered. God set up His throne close to the Tree of Life. 

Then God summoned Adam and said, "Adam, do you think you can hide from Me? 
Can the building hide from its builder?" 

Adam replied, "Lord, I was afraid, for I am naked and ashamed." And God pronounced 
the punishments of the man and the woman and the serpent, and God commanded that 
the man and woman be expelled from the Garden. 

Then Adam begged God to let him eat of the Tree of Life before he left the Garden. But 
God said, "You cannot take of it in your lifetime." 

Then the angels began to expel him, but Adam began to cry. "I beseech you," he 
pleaded," let me take incense with me from the Garden, so that I may offer sweet incense 
to God. Then perhaps God will hearken to me." The angels let him be, and Adam took 
sweet incense with him, iris and balsam, and he and Eve went forth from the Garden. 

Just before God confronts Adam and Eve with their sin. Genesis 3:8 states, They 
heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the Garden toward the cool of the day. This myth, 
from the Armenian version of Vita Adae et Evae known as Penitence of Adam, describes 
God's descent from heaven and His arrival in the Garden of Eden in His Chariot, the 
Merkavah, driven by cherubs. It explains how God traveled from heaven to the Garden 
of Eden. This descent of God reflects the themes of Merkavah literature, and should be 
considered an example of it.

562. THE LAND OF ERETZ 

When Adam left the Garden of Eden, he came to the land of Eretz, a place of darkness 
and desolation, where sunlight is never seen. On entering there, Adam was gripped by 
great fear. No matter how far Adam went in any direction, he encountered the flame of 
the ever-turning sword that blazed on all sides of Eretz. Only when the Sabbath ended 
and Adam had thoughts of repentance, did God take him out of Eretz and bring him to 
the Land of Adamah, where he found peace at last. 

The Land of Eretz is described here as a place of desolation, where Adam faced the 
consequences of his sin and experienced the most intense grief. Note that no mention 
of Eve is made, although the Genesis narrative indicates that Adam and Eve remained 
together. This strongly suggests that Eretz is an allegorical land, representing the kind 
of grief that precedes repentance. The myth also indicates that having been expelled 
from Eden, Adam experiences panic and fright, as the boundaries of his formerly peace- 
ful existence vanish, replaced by fearful unknowns. Indeed, melancholy and fear are 
part of his now-fallen condition. At the same time, rabbinic commentaries suggest 
that he had a great deal to regret. He bitterly regretted his sin and expulsion from 
Eden. He especially mourned over having brought death into the world, for now he 
and all his descendants had become mortal. 

Once he repents, however, Adam is brought to the allegorical land of Adamah, and 
there, at last, he experiences peace. One version of this myth, from Zohar Hadash, states 
that after Adam had repented by entering the waters of the river Gihon up to his neck, 

God brought him to the land of Adamah, thus indicating God's forgiveness. 

This myth raises the question of why Eretz (land) was selected to represent a place 
of suffering, while Adama (ground) represents a place of inner peace. The answer 
derives from the use of these terms in the Genesis narrative about Adam and about 
Cain. So the Lord God banished him from the garden of Eden , to till the soil (adamah ) from 
which he was taken (Gen. 3:23). This suggests a compatibility between Adam the man 
and the Land of Adama, because Adam was created from the dust of the earth, a link 
that is underscored by their similar names. Eretz, by contrast, appears in Genesis 4:12 
as a place where Cain is condemned to wander. 

The presence of the ever-turning fiery sword, echoing Genesis 3:24, illustrates both 
that Adam is trapped in the land of Eretz, and, at the same time, that Eretz is some- 
how connected to Eden, from which he has been expelled. Thus the ever-turning fiery 
sword symbolizes all the limitations that have developed in Adam's life, which have 
left him virtually trapped both in a desolate land and in his own bitter remorse.

563. ADAM'S ACCOUNT OF THE FALL 

On his deathbed, Adam recounted his memories of the Fall to his son, Seth: "After your 
mother and I were created, God placed us in Paradise. We were permitted to eat from 
every tree in the garden, except for one — the Tree of Knowledge that grew in the center of 
the garden. We were forbidden to eat of its fruit. 

"Now God gave a part of Paradise to me and a part to your mother. He gave me the 
trees in the eastern and northern parts of the garden, and your mother received the trees 
of the southern and western parts. So too did God give us two angels to guard us. 



EXILE FROM EDEN 441 


"Each day, when the time came for the angels to worship in the presence of God, they 
ascended on high. Once the adversary, Satan, took advantage of the angels' absence and 
convinced your mother to eat of the forbidden fruit. And after she ate of it, she gave it 
to me. 

"No sooner did we taste the forbidden fruit, than the Lord grew angry with us and 
said, 'Because of this, you and all of your generation will suffer pains in each separate 
limb, for I will bring seventy plagues upon you.' 

"And when Eve, your mother, saw me weeping, she too began to weep. And she spoke 
up and said, 'O Lord, my God, give his pain to me, for it was I who sinned/ And she said 
to me, 'Give me a portion of your pain, for your guilt has come from me.' And ever since, 
both of us have had our share of suffering." 

This version of the Fall by Adam to his son Seth adds some important details to the 
account in Genesis 3, such as that the Garden of Eden was divided into two parts, one 
for Adam and one for Eve. This seems to imply that territorial possession finds its 
origin with the first couple. Adam also explains how the serpent — here directly iden- 
tified as Satan — succeeded in seducing Eve into eating the forbidden fruit. It seems 
that God had sent two angels, one for Adam and one for Eve, to guard and protect 
them. But when the angels left to pray in God's presence, Satan took advantage of 
their absence. Also added to Adam's account is Eve's explicit confession of guilt, as 
well as her offer to share in Adam's suffering. This perpetuates the blame Eve is to 
bear for the Fall, but at the same time it portrays her in an exceptionally favorable 
manner, willing to share both in Adam's guilt and in his suffering.

564. WHAT THE SERPENT SAID TO EVE 

In order to convince Eve to taste the forbidden fruit, the serpent said: "But God knows that 
as soon as you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God " (Gen. 3:5-6). Know that 
God ate of this tree and then created the world. That is why He has commanded you not 
to eat of it, lest you create other worlds. The truth is that you were brought into being to 
rule over everything. Make haste and eat before God creates other worlds that will domi- 
nate you." And Eve saw how plausible were the words of the serpent, and she tasted the 
fruit. 


This midrash adds significantly to the biblical version in having the serpent sug- 
gest to Eve that God Himself gained His powers after eating from die Tree of Knowl- 
edge. While the serpent's original comments promised Eve knowledge, they did not 
imply that God obtained His knowledge in this way. But the rabbis, reading between 
the lines, saw a hint of such a meaning in the serpent's comments and made this hint 
explicit. To do so is to belittle God's unique powers, and it turns the serpent into a 
heretic. Thus this midrash may be viewed as aimed not only at the serpent, but at 
those with Gnostic views who failed to acknowledge God's unique powers as Creator 
of the world.

565. SATAN AND THE SERPENT 

Satan said to the serpent, "Arise and come to me. I will tell you something that will serve 
you well." The serpent came to him and Satan said, "You are said to be wiser than all the 
other animals. None is your equal in cunning. That is why I have come to see you." 

Now all the wild beasts, including the serpent, came to worship Adam every morn- 
ing. One morning Satan went with them and said to the serpent, "Why do you worship 
Adam? You came into being before he did. He should worship you. Come, rise up. Let us 
expel Adam from the Garden." 

The serpent said, "How can we expel him from the Garden?" 

Satan said, "You will be a lyre for me, and I will pronounce words through your mouth, 
so that you may be able to help." 

Then Satan took on the form of an angel and began to praise God with angelic phrases. 
Eve knelt down by the wall and listened to his prayers. When she looked at him, she saw 
the likeness of an angel, but when she looked at him again, he was not to be seen. 

Then Satan called upon the serpent to be his mouthpiece, and the serpent came to Eve 
and said, "Are you Eve?" 

"Yes I am." 

"What do you do in the Garden?" 

"God put us here to guard the Garden." 

"And do you eat of the trees in the Garden?" 

"Yes," said Eve. "We eat of all of them except for one tree in the very middle. God 
commanded us not to eat of it, lest we die." 

"No, you will not die," Satan said. "But when you eat of its fruit your eyes will be 
opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil. God deceived you when 
He said not to eat of it. Look at the glory that surrounds the tree." 

And when Eve looked up and saw the great glory surrounding it, she said, "The tree is 
pleasing to my sight, but I am afraid. If you are not afraid, bring me the fruit and I will eat 
it, so I may know if your words are true or not." 

Then Satan made Eve swear an oath that if she ate of the fruit of the tree, she would 
share it with Adam. Then the serpent brought her to the tree and lowered the branches of 
the tree to the earth. As he held them down. Eve plucked some of the fruit and ate it. 

When Satan saw this, he had the serpent descend from the tree and hide in the Garden. 

In most interpretations of the story of the Fall, the serpent is identified as Satan. In 
this myth the serpent serves as the mouthpiece of Satan. This version changes quite a 
few details in the biblical account, including some negotiation between Eve and the 
serpent about the conditions under which she would eat the fruit. Eve is afraid to pick 
the fruit and asks the serpent to do it for her. Instead, the serpent lowers the tree to the 
earth, making it easy for her to pick the fruit, which she does. Eve's reluctance is also 
found in the midrash, in which she first bites only the skin of the fruit, and when 
nothing happens, eats the rest of the fruit. ( Zekhor Hamor on Gen. 3:6.) Note that the 
oath that Satan forces Eve to make would be the first oath, and it is made to Satan 
rather than to God.

566. THE QUEST FOR THE OIL OF LIFE 

As Adam lay dying, he called upon Eve and his son Seth to go off alone and prostrate 
themselves before God, and beg God to send an angel to the Tree of Mercy in the Garden 



EXILE FROM EDEN 443 


of Eden, from which flows the Oil of Life. For he knew that if he were anointed with that 
oil, he would receive respite from his pain. 

So Seth and his mother, Eve, set out for the Gates of Paradise. Along the way, a beast 
appeared — a serpent — and attacked Seth. Eve shouted at the serpent, "Accursed beast! 
Keep your distance from the image of God." Hearing this, the beast left their presence, 
but Seth was left with the marks of its teeth upon him. 

When Seth and Eve arrived at the gates, they put dust from the ground on their heads 
and prostrated themselves, begging the Lord to pity Adam and send an angel to anoint 
him with that oil. 

After they had prayed for many hours, the angel Michael appeared to them. The angel 
said, "God has sent me to you, for I have been appointed by God to look after men's 
bodies. Weep and pray no more for the Oil of Life, for you can never have it, except at the 
End of Days. Go back to your father, for the span of his life is complete. Six days from 
now his soul will depart from his body. When it does, you will see great wonders in the 
lights of heaven and on the earth." 

And the death of Adam came after six days, just as the angel Michael had predicted. 

This myth of the Oil of Life, said to flow from the Tree of Mercy in the Garden of 
Eden, is a completely new motif, missing entirely in Genesis. Here there is said to be 
another key tree in the Garden of Eden, in addition to the Tree of Knowledge and the 
Tree of Life. T his is t he Tree of Mercy, and the Oil of Life is sa id to flow from it. From 
Adam's descriptionTtappears that the Oil of Ofe is a balm that Adam recalls from his 
days in the garden. Whether it not only alleviates pain but sustains life as well is not 
stated. If so, it would be linked with the Tree of Life. Although less well known, the 
myth of the Oil of Life is similar to the myth of the Waters of Eternal Life: whoever 
drinks of those waters will have eternal life. 

The episode in which Seth is attacked by a serpent has the effect of renewing the 
enmity between the serpent and human beings in the next generation, as well as serv- 
ing as a reminder of the story of the Fall. The encounter with this beast, as the serpent 
is called, becomes a stage in the quest to retrieve the Oil of Life, every quest having its 
share of adversity.

567. THE GENERATIONS OF SETH 

Cain was not of Adam's seed, nor after his likeness, nor after his image. Adam did not 
beget in his own image until Seth was bom, as it is said. He begot a son in his likeness after 
his image (Gen. 5:3). Indeed, Seth was the exact image of Adam. Adam was 130 years old 
when Seth was born. 

Adam knew the Torah, and he transmitted it to his son, Seth, and it was later transmit- 
ted to Enoch. Adam also was the first High Priest, and when he offered a sacrifice, he 
wore the garments of the High Priest. And when he died, they passed to Seth, and from 
Seth they passed to Methuselah. 

Seth was bom circumcised, and he became a virtuous man, of excellent character, whose 
children imitated his virtues. That is why it is said about Seth that whatever he does pros- 
pers (Ps. 1:3). From Seth descended all of the generations of the righteous, while from 
Cain descended all the generations of the wicked. For seven generations the children of 



444 MYTHS OF EXILE 


Seth inhabited the same country without dissension, without any misfortunes falling 
upon them till they died. They gained a great deal of wisdom about the heavenly bodies. 

Now Adam had predicted that the world was to be destroyed once by fire and another 
time by water. And so that their discoveries might not be lost before they were suffi- 
ciently known, the descendants of Seth made two pillars, one of brick and the other of 
stone. And they inscribed their discoveries on them both, so that if one or the other should 
be destroyed by flood or fire, the other might remain and reveal their discoveries to hu- 
mankind. And God commanded two angels to guard these inscriptions so that they might 
not be destroyed until the final age. 

While the legendary tradition about Seth, Adam's third son, is limited in Jewish 
sources, there is some evidence of the glorification of Seth, suggesting that the soul of 
Seth entered into Moses and will again reappear in the Messiah. Seth is a major figure 
in Gnostic texts, such as The Apocalypse of Adam. The myths about Seth recount how 
angels would rescue the seed of Seth at the time of the Flood and hide his descendants 
in a secret place. For more about the evil descendants of Cain, see "The Seed of Cain," 
p. 448. 

Being born circumcised, as is recounted here of Seth, is a sign of greatness and 
purity. In Zohar l:58a-b, Noah is also said to have been born circumcised.

568. THE CREATION OF CENTAURS 

Adam was created in the likeness and the image of God, as was Adam's son Seth, and 
Seth s son, Enosh. But after that the resemblance came to an end, and the generations 
became corrupt. 

Beginning with Enosh, humans came to practice magic and divination, and the art of 
controlling the heavenly forces. Before long, their faces became apelike and they became 
vulnerable to demons. They had all manner of intercourse with humans and beasts, and 
that is when centaurs came into being. So too did people begin to gather gold, silver, and 
all kinds of precious gems, and with them they constructed idols, and prayed to them. 
They even used the Name of God for sacrilegious purposes. 

This myth demonstrates a kind of devolution in which men become corrupt and 
regress into beastlike beings. The sexual sins listed here, as well as the use of black 
magic, and the lust for possessions are offered to justify God's decision to destroy the 
generation of the Flood. Although the centaur, half man, half horse, is a figure out of 
Greek mythology, here its existence is explained as the product of human intercourse 
with beasts and as further evidence of the kind of sin that led God to the decision to 
destroy all life on earth except for Noah and his family and the animals on the ark.

569. THE DEATH OF ADAM 

Adam lay dying in his tent. When he realized that the hour of his death had arrived, he 
cried out in a loud voice, "Let all my sons gather by me, so that I may see them and bless 



EXILE FROM EDEN 445 


them before I die." Then all his sons, from every part of the world, gathered by him, and 
Adam blessed them and said, "Behold, I am nine hundred and thirty years old. When I 
die, bury me toward the east." And when he finished speaking, he breathed his last, and 
the sun and moon and stars were darkened for seven days. 

Seth bent over his father's body and embraced it. Eve's hands were folded over her 
head, and all of Adam's children wept bitterly. And the angel Michael appeared and 
stood at Adam's head, and the angels blew their trumpets and cried, "Blessed are You, O 
Lord, for You have had pity on Your creature." Then Seth saw God's hand stretched out 
and holding Adam. And God said to Michael, "Let him be in your charge until the day of 
judgment, when I will turn sorrow into joy." 

Then God said to the angels Michael and Uriel, "Bring three linen sheets and spread 
them out over Adam and over Adam's son, Abel, and bury Adam and his son." And all 
the hosts of angels marched in procession in front of Adam's body, and Michael and Uriel 
buried Adam in one of the regions of Paradise, in the presence of Seth and his mother, 
Eve, and no one else. And Michael and Uriel said to them, "Just as we have done, so too 
must you bury your dead." 

All that is said in the Bible of the death of Adam is All the days that Adam lived came up 
to 930 years; then he died (Gen. 5:5). Here the details of Adam's death are embellished, 
and the story continued about how Adam was mourned and what took place after his 
death. The angel Michael appears at the time of Adam's death, and God hands the body 
of Adam to Michael, to hold until the End of Days. The myth also adds God's explicit 
promise to "turn sorrow into joy," hinting at the glories of the messianic era. Most inter- 
esting, Adam is buried together with his son, Abel, who apparently had not been buried 
until that time. That Adam and his son are buried together is a moving image, making 
Adam's death that much more poignant. Finally, this myth offers an origin myth for the 
practice of burying those who have died, and makes it a divine commandment, con- 
veyed by the angels Michael and Uriel after they buried Adam. 

In The Apocalypse of Moses , which is believed to be a Jewish text with Christian 
interpolations, a dream of Eve is related in which Adam was taken into a tall shining 
Temple and seated on a throne in the presence of three divine beings, and this is to be 
understood as predicting that Adam would soon be in heaven. Some scholars identify 
the three divine beings as the three angels who visited Abraham, while others identify 
them with the Christian Trinity.

570, PARADISE 

We were created to live in Paradise. Paradise was intended to serve us. Our destiny has 
changed. It is not said that the same thing would have been true for Paradise. 

We were cast out of Paradise, but it was not destroyed. Our expulsion was in a sense 
fortunate. Had we not been cast out. Paradise would have had to be destroyed. 

This brief parable contains Kafka's understanding of the Paradise myth in Genesis. 
According to Kafka, Paradise still exists by virtue of the fact that Adam and Eve were 
expelled from it — otherwise, it would have had to be destroyed. Thus, for Kafka, Para- 
dise is an archetype of perfection that still inspires us, even if we cannot fully experi- 
ence it. Therefore we were lucky to be expelled, so that Paradise can continue to exist. 

Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel also has an original view of Paradise: "After having 
eaten the forbidden fruit, the Lord sent forth man from Paradise, to till the ground from 



446 MYTHS OF EXILE 


which he was taken. But man, who is more subtle than any other creature that God 
has made, what did he do? He undertook to build a Paradise by his own might, and 
he is driving God from his Paradise" ( The Insecurity of Freedom, pp. 164-165). Thus 
Heschel proposes a reversal of the exile process, where we drive God from our Para- 
dise, just as God drove us from His.

a male child with the help of the Lord." She then bore his brother Abel. Abel became a 
keeper of sheep, and Cain became a tiller of the soil. In the course of time, Cain brought 
an offering to the Lord from the fruit of the soil; and Abel, for his part, brought the choic- 
est of the firstlings of his flock. The Lord paid heed to Abel and his offering, but to Cain 
and his offering He paid no heed. Cain was much distressed and his face fell. And the 
Lord said to Cain, "Why are you distressed, and why is your face fallen? Surely, if you do 
right, there is uplift. But if you do not do right sin couches at the door; its urge is toward 
you, yet you can be its master." 

Cain said to his brother Abel, "Come, let us go out into the field," and when they were 
in the field, Cain set upon his brother Abel and killed him. The Lord said to Cain, "Where 
is your brother Abel?" And he said, "1 do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?" Then He 
said. What have you done? Hark, your brother's blood cries out to Me from the ground! 
Therefore, you shall be more cursed than the ground, which opened its mouth to receive 
your brother s blood from your hand. If you till the soil, it shall no longer yield its strength 
to you. You shall become a ceaseless wanderer on earth." 

Cain said to the Lord, My punishment is too great to bear! Since You have banished 
me this day from the soil, and I must avoid Your presence and become a restless wan- 
derer on earth— anyone who meets me may kill me!" The Lord said to him, "I promise, if 
anyone kills Cain, sevenfold vengeance shall be taken on him." And the Lord put a mark 
on Cain, lest anyone who met him should kill him. Cain left the presence of the Lord and 
settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden. 

The theme of competing brothers is also found in the biblical accounts of Isaac and 
Ishmael, Jacob and Esau, and Joseph and his brothers. 

No reason is given for God's preference of Abel's offering over Cain's. Also, no 
reason is given for Cain s attack on Abel. However, both of these Questions are an- 
swered in detail in the Midrash, where Abel's offering was preferred because it con- 
sisted of the choicest of his flock, and the struggle between the brothers is blamed on 
a struggle over a woman. The ultimate fate of Cain is also not mentioned, although 
rabbinic tradition provides four different versions of Cain's death. See "The Death of 
Cain," p. 451. 

Parallel accounts of two brothers are found in the literature of the ancient Near East. 

The Egyptian stories of Anubis and Bata concern two brothers who work as farmers but 
become enemies after Anubis's wife falsely accuses Bata of propositioning her. Anubis, 
in his fury, goes to kill Bata with a spear, but the god Ra creates a lake full of crocodiles 
to protect Bata from his older brother. Eventually the two brothers reconcile, and each, 
in turn, becomes pharaoh. See Old Testament Parallels: Laws and Stories from the Ancient 
Near East by Victor H. Matthews and Don C. Benjamin, pp. 61-65.

572. HOW CAIN WAS CONCEIVED 

Samael was the great prince in heaven. After God created the world, Samael took his 
band of followers and descended and saw the creatures that God had created. Among 
them he found none so skilled to do evil as the serpent, as it is said. Now the serpent was the 
shrewdest of all the wild beasts (Gen. 3:1). Its appearance was something like that of a camel, 
and Samael mounted and rode upon it. Riding on the serpent, the angel Samael came to 
Eve in the night and seduced her, and she conceived Cain. Later, while Eve was pregnant 
by the angel, Adam came to her, and she conceived Abel. 

Others say it was the serpent himself who seduced Eve, for after he saw Adam and Eve 
coupling, the serpent conceived a passion for her. He even imagined killing Adam and mar- 
rying Eve. So he came to Eve when she was alone and possessed her and infused her with 
lust. That is how the serpent fathered Cain, who was later to slay his own brother. And that is 
how Eve was infected with his impurity. As a result, all of Israel was impure from that time 
until the Torah was given on Mount Sinai. Only then did Israel's impurity cease. 

When Cain was born, Adam knew at once that he was not of his seed, for he was not 
after his likeness, nor after his image. Instead, Cain's appearance was that of a heavenly 
being. And when Eve saw that his appearance was not of this world, she said, I have 
gained a male child with the help ofYahweh (Gen. 4:1). 

It was not until the birth of Seth that Adam had a son who was in his own likeness and 
image. From Seth arose all of the generations of the righteous, while all the generations 
that descended from the seed of Cain are wicked, until this very day. 

This myth is a response to the enigmatic verse in which Eve says, I have gotten a man 
with the aid of Yahweh (Gen. 4:1). Targum Pseudo-Yonathan translates this verse as "I 
have acquired a man, the angel of the Lord." 

One reading of this verse in the Talmud (B. Shah. 146a) suggests that Eve had inter- 
course with the serpent: "When the serpent consorted with Eve, he cast impurity into 
her." This interpretation is echoed in the Zohar: "From the impurity with which the 
serpent infected Eve emerged Cain." Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer builds on the talmudic in- 
terpretation, but changes it in an essential way. Here the true father of Cain is the 
angel Samael, who came to Eve riding on the serpent. Indeed, in this passage the 
angel and serpent are closely linked, creating a satanic figure and suggesting that Eve 
had intercourse with the serpent, a powerful phallic symbol. 

In Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer , the Torah upbraids Samael as he rides upon the serpent 
like a camel: "The Torah began to cry aloud, saying, 'Why, O Samael, now that the 
world is created, is it time to rebel against God? Is this the time to lift yourself on 
high? God will laugh at the horse and its rider/" This establishes the role of the Torah 
as the defender of the human race against the evil intentions of Samael. 

Zohar 1:36b explains that two came upon Eve, the serpent and Adam, and that she 
became pregnant from both of them, and bore two sons. The son of the serpent is, of 
course, Cain. In order to explain why Cain was evil and Abel was good, Zohar 1:54a 
explains that Cain was conceived from the side of unholiness and Abel from the side 
of holiness. As a result, Abel was in the likeness of God's image, as stated in the verse 
And God created man in His image (Gen. 1:27). But Cain was of the likeness of the nether 
image. Just what this is isn't clear, although one commentary, Ziv ha-Zohar, identifies 
the nether image as that of an ape. Because Cain was from the side of the Angel of 
Death (another possible explanation of the "nether image"), he killed his brother. 

The idea that Eve was infected by the impurity of the serpent when she had inter- 
course with it attempts to portray women as not only impure, but also untrustworthy. It 
is part of an extensive antifeminine bias found in some rabbinic texts. However, in other 
texts. Eve is portrayed in a very favorable manner. She is regarded as the mother of all 
generations, and she is called a life-giver, who nursed the whole world (B. AZ 43a). 



448 MYTHS OF EXILE 


The serpent of Genesis becomes transformed in kabbalah into a principle of evil, 
the primal serpent who makes its home in the darkness of the Sitra Ahra, the Other 
Side. It is a serpent by the road , a viper by the path (Gen. 49:17). It comes down from 
above, swims across bitter waters, and descends in order to deceive, lying in wait to 
ambush mankind with sins. The Sitra Ahra is the realm of evil. It is said to be ruled by 
Samael and Lilith. The primal or primordial serpent is an archetype of evil, based 
upon the serpent in the Garden of Eden. In this realm it functions as a force of evil, an 
exaggerated version of the Yetzer ha-Ra, the Evil Impulse in every person. Here this 
impulse is understood to be an underlying principle in the concept of an evil realm. 
Evil, however, flourishes only in the absence of good. The Zohar describes this serpent 
as "eternal death, on the left side, that enters into a man's innermost secret parts" 
(Zohar 2:52a). 

See the closely related myth, "The Seed of Cain," p. 448. For a Hasidic tale about 
the primal serpent, see "Reb Shmelke's Whip" in Gabriel's Palace, p. 226.

573. THE SEED OF CAIN 

Adam was not Cain's father. Cain was conceived by Samael riding the serpent in the Gar- 
den of Eden. The serpent came to Eve at night and had intercourse with her, and Cain was 
bom from this union. Thus Cain was not of Adam's seed, nor after his likeness, nor after his 
image. Adam did not have a son in his own image and likeness until Seth was bom. 

After Cain became a restless wanderer (Gen. 4:14), he settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden 
(Gen. 4:16). He married and Cain knew his wife , and she conceived (Gen. 4:17). Some say that 
the offspring of Cain went extinct after seven generations, for God chose to visit the iniq- 
uity of the fathers upon the children (Exod. 34:7). 

Others say that the seed of Cain still walk the earth. For from Seth arose and were 
descended all the generations of the righteous, and from Cain arose and were descended 
all the generations of the wicked, who rebelled and sinned against heaven. One and all 
the seed of Cain are descended from the serpent, and they are the enemies of Israel — 
Amalek, Edom and Rome. 

Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer says of the conception of Cain, "Samael riding on the serpent 
came to Eve and she conceived." This creates two lines of people, those descended 
from the seed of Adam and his son, Seth, and those descended from the seed of Cain. 

See "How Cain was Conceived," p. 447. 

According to B. Shabbat, Eve had sexual relations with the serpent in the Garden of 
Eden and the snake deposited a pollution in Eve that entered into her children and 
her children's children. However, this explanation does not distinguish between the 
seed of Seth and the seed of Cain. When Israel accepted the Torah at Mount Sinai, the 
seed of Seth was purified of the pollution the snake had deposited in Eve and that had 
entered her children's children. The same cannot be said of the seed of Cain. 

This myth about Cain's conception and the seed of Cain derives, in part, from Gen- 
esis 5:3: When Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years, he begot a son in his likeness 
after his image, and he named him Seth. This is taken to imply that Cain was not Adam's 
son. The Zohar (1:55a) explains that neither Cain nor Abel was born in Adam's like- 
ness, based on the verse She conceived and bore Cain, saying/1 have gained a male child 
with the help ofYahweh (Gen. 4:1). The Zohar takes this to mean that both Cain and Abel 
stemmed chiefly from Eve, rather than Adam. Seth, by contrast, bore Adam's image. 



&lt;AIN AND ABEL 449 


The tradition that there are two lines of descent, from the seed of Adam and from 
the seed of Cain, is found in Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer and other sources. Some attribute 
this tradition to Rabbi Ishmael and other to Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai. 

This midrash offers an explanation for the existence of Israel's enemies, explaining 
that they were all descended from the seed of Cain. During and after the Holocaust, 
the Nazis were sometimes identified as the "seed of Cain."

574. THE BIRTH OF CAIN 

Eve was the first woman ever to give birth. When the time came, neither Adam nor Eve 
knew what to expect, and they were very afraid. Adam wept and prayed to God on her 
behalf. All at once two angels and two powers descended from heaven, and stood before 
Eve. The powers said to her, "Eve, you are blessed. Adam's prayers are mighty, and 
through him God's help has come to you." Then the angel said, "Prepare yourself. I will 
be the midwife for you." 

Before long Eve gave birth to Cain. The color of his body was like the color of the stars. 
No sooner did the newborn child fall into the hands of the angel who served as a mid- 
wife than he leaped up and plucked the grass that grew near his mother's hut. After that 
nothing would ever grow there, and anyone who passed by that place became infertile. 

And the angel said to him, " You shall become a ceaseless wanderer on earth (Gen. 4:12). 
Your legacy will be one of adultery and bitterness." And so it came to pass. 

This is an origin tale, an account of the first birth, that of Cain, who became a 
prototype for evil. In the biblical account, Cain slays Abel for no apparent reason, but 
there are several midrashic explanations, such as a fight over one of their twin sisters, 
or over their property rights— Cain claimed rights to all the land and Abel to all the 
air. Cain told Abel to get off of his land. Abel told Cain to stop breathing his air. 

This version of the birth of Cain also adds many foreboding elements that suggest 
that Cain was not a normal child but some kind of supernatural being. "The color of 
his body was like the color of the stars" — this seems to suggest he was glowing, an 
abnormal condition. Further, the newborn infant jumps out of the angel's hands and 
his first act is a destructive one — he pulls out the grass around his mother's hut, which 
never grows back. Here Cain is painted as evil from the very beginning, and this is 
confirmed by the angel who prophesies Cain's fate.

575. THE WIVES OF CAIN AND ABEL 

Where did the wives of Cain and Abel come from? On the day that Adam and Eve were 
created, on that very day they coupled, and on that very day they produced offspring. It 
is said that two entered the bed and seven left it, for Cain was bom with a twin sister, and 
Abel was bom with two sisters. 

Cain married Abel's twin, and Abel married Cain's. But they could not agree on the 
fate of Abel's second twin. Indeed, it is said that she was the subject of the dispute be- 
tween the two brothers, out of which Cain slew his brother Abel, and the voices of the 
blood of the families who were destined to issue forth from Abel cried out before God. 



450 MYTHS OF EXILE 


Since Genesis does not explain what it was that Cain and Abel fought over, there 
are many myths that speculate about it. One of the most common explanations is that 
they were fighting over a woman. In this version, she is identified as Abel's second 
twin. In other versions, such as Genesis Rabbah 22:7, the woman they fought over is 
identified as the first Eve. See "The First Eve," p. 140. This midrash makes the as- 
sumption that Cain and Abel were themselves twins, although the biblical text does 
not state this, and seems to imply that they were not. 

Sefer Zikhronot gives the name of the Cain's wife as Kalmana, and of Abel's wife as 
Deborah. This text also identifies these wives as their twins, contrary to the version in 
which Cain and Abel do not marry their own twins, but each one marries the other 's 
twin.

576. EVE'S NIGHT VISION 

One night, when Cain and Abel were both young men. Eve had a terrible dream. When 
she awoke she told the dream to Adam: " While I was sleeping, I saw in a night vision that 
the blood of our son Abel was entering the mouth of our son Cain. Cain drank his blood 
without mercy. Abel beseeched him to leave a little, but he drank his blood completely." 

Hearing this, Adam said, "Surely this means that Cain must intend to kill Abel. Come, 
let us keep them apart. Let each of them live in a separate place." So Adam said to them, 
"My sons, let each of you go to your own place." And they did. 

After this, God sent the angel Michael to Adam. God said, "Adam understands that 
Cain intends to kill Abel. Go to him and tell him not to reveal this mystery to Cain, for 
Cain is a son of wrath who will kill Abel, his brother. So too should you tell Adam not to 
grieve because I will give him another son, Seth. Seth will bear my image, and through 
him many mysteries will be revealed." 

And the angel came to Adam and spoke to him, and Adam revealed what the angel 
told him only to Eve, and they both grieved to learn the fate of Abel. 

Dreams and visions are often understood to be prophetic. Here Eve has a prophetic 
dream or vision — she calls it a "night vision" — in which Cain behaves like a beast or a 
vampire and drinks all of Abel's blood. When Eve tells this dream to Adam, he under- 
stands its meaning at once — that Cain will murder Abel. He hopes to prevent this by 
separating them, but God sends the angel Michael to reveal the inevitability of this 
fate, as well as promising them the birth of another son, Seth, who is dearly intended 
to take Abel's place. 

The prophecy of the birth of Seth, and the description of his powers makes it seem 
likely that this myth reflects the veneration of Seth that played a central role in Gnos- 
ticism. For Gnostic texts about Seth see Apocalypse of Adam , where Adam communi- 
cates a secret Gnostic revelation to Seth. 

Eve's dream portrays Cain's crime in the stark and primitive terms of drinking a 
victim's blood. For an equally primitive myth, see "How Samael Entered the Heart of 
Man," p. 454.

577. THE DEATH OF CAIN 

How did Cain meet his death? Some say that Cain fulfilled his destiny as a ceaseless wan- 
derer on earth (Gen. 4:12) until the time of the Flood, and that he drowned in the Flood 
with everyone else, except for Noah and his family. 

Others say that Cain, the founder of the first city, was killed when his house, made of 
stones, fell upon him, stoning him to death. Thus was Cain killed in the same way he had 
killed his brother, confirming that a man shall be killed with the weapons with which he 
kills his fellow man. 

Still others say that Cain's final destiny was in being transformed into the Angel of 
Death, since he was responsible for the first death. For a hundred and thirty years Cain 
wandered and roamed about, accursed. Thereafter Lamech served as the Angel of Death. 

But most agree that Cain met his death at the hands of his own descendants, Lamech 
and Tubal-Cain. In those days Lamech was old and advanced in years, and his eyes were 
dim so that he could not see. One day his son, Tubal-Cain, was leading him while they 
were walking in the field, when Cain, the son of Adam, advanced toward them. And 
Tubal-Cain told his father to draw his bow, and with the arrows he smote Cain, who was 
yet far off, and he slew him, for he appeared to them to be an animal. And the arrows 
entered Cain's body although he was distant from them, and he fell to the ground and 
died. And the Lord requited Cain's evil according to his wickedness, which he had done 
to his brother Abel, according to the word of the Lord that He had spoken. And it came to 
pass that when Cain had died, that Lamech and Tubal-Cain went to see the animal they 
had slain, and they saw, and behold Cain their grandfather was fallen dead upon the 
earth. And Lamech was very much grieved at having done this, and in clapping his hands 
together he struck his son and caused his death. 

Lamech's wives, Tsila and Ada, found him later that night, and were furious to learn 
that he had caused the deaths of Cain and Tubal-Cain. They vowed never to share his bed 
again. But Lamech took them to Adam, the judge, and Adam ruled that they must obey 
their husband. 

Since the biblical narrative of Cain is unfinished, the rabbis were left to resolve the 
story in both a moral and a literary sense. Using the tradition of the Oral Law as their 
justification, and supporting their interpretations with biblical prooftexts, the rabbis 
embellished the tale of Cain and Abel in many respects. They filled in the sketchy 
details of the births of the two brothers (Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 21), the mystery of the 
origin of their wives (Genesis Rabbah 22:2 ), the conflict between the two ( Genesis Rabbah 
22:7), the murder of Abel by Cain ( Genesis Rabbah 22:8), the burial of Abel ( Pirkei de- 
Rabbi Eliezer 21), and the punishment and ultimate fate of Cain. 

The end of the biblical narrative about Cain describes his punishment by God and 
concludes by attributing to Cain the founding of the first city (Gen. 4:17). After Cain 
has been cursed to become a ceaseless wanderer on earth (Gen. 4:12), he protests the 
severity of the sentence and has it modified (Gen. 4:13-15). 

Of particular interest to the rabbis was the nature of the sign by which God had 
marked Cain, to identify and protect him in his wanderings. One of the earliest midrashim 
speculating on this sign appears in Genesis Rabbah 22:12: "And the Lord put a mark on Cain 
(Gen. 4:15). Rabbi Judah said: "He caused the orb of the sun to shine on his account.' 

Said Rabbi Nehemiah to him: 'He caused the orb of the sun to shine! Rather, He afflicted 
him with leprosy/ Rab said: 'He gave him a dog.' Abba Jose said: 'He made a hom grow 
out of his forehead/ Rabbi Levi quotes Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish as saying, 'He sus- 
pended his punishment until the Flood came and swept him away/" 

Of these five versions of the nature of the mark of Cain, the one that entered the 
folk tradition was that of the horn, said to be located on his forehead. The reason for 



452 MYTHS OF EXILE 


this should be apparent — the horn signified Cain's essentially savage nature and thus 
identified him as a beast. Later this horn was incorporated into the most widely ac- 
cepted account of the death of Cain, in which he was slain by his descendants Lamech 
and Tubal-Cain. 

While this became the most popular version of Cain's death, three other versions 
can be found. In one attributed to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, Cain was said to have 
found his death along with the other victims of the Flood. But this punishment was 
unsatisfying in that it did not single out Cain. The rabbis strongly felt that a decisive 
punishment for him was called for, to set a precedent for future murderers. 

Another version of Cain's death appears in the apocryphal Book of Jubilees (4:31). 
Here Cain is said to have been killed when his house fell on him. Just as he had killed 
Abel with a stone, so was he slain by stones: "Cain was killed when his house fell 
upon him and he died in the midst of his house, killed by its stones. For with a stone 
he had killed Abel, and by a stone he was killed in righteous judgment." Then the 
Book of Jubilees goes on to link this judgment with the Law: "The instrument with 
which a man kills his neighbor will be the same with which he shall be killed; after the 
manner that he wounded him, in a like manner shall they deal with him." This refers 
to Exodus 21:24, following the pattern of You shall give life for life , eye for eye, tooth for 
tooth , hand for hand, foot for foot (Exod. 21:24. See also Leviticus 24:19 and Deuteronomy 
19:21). 

A third account of Cain's death is found in Midrash Tanhuma-Yelammedenu, where it 
is said that when he died, Cain was transformed into the Angel of Death. This pro- 
vides an origin myth for the Angel of Death. 

The first principle of supporting a midrashic interpretation is to link it to a biblical 
prooftext. Since there is no description of the death of Cain in the Bible, the rabbis 
turned to an enigmatic passage about Cain's descendent, Lamech: And Lamech said to 
his wives: Ada and Tsila, hear my voice ; You wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech. For I have 
slain a man for wounding me, and a young man for bruising me. If Cain is avenged sevenfold, 
then Lamech seventy -sevenfold. (Gen. 4:23-24). 

This perplexing passage is almost certainly a fragment of a lost myth about Lamech. 
But it is cleverly interpreted in Midrash Tanhuma-Yelammendenu to prove that Cain was 
slain by Lamech, who was accompanied by his son, Tubal-Cain. This account of Cain's 
death at the hands of Lamech ingeniously utilizes two existing traditions associated 
with Cain — the enigmatic passage concerning Lamech and the midrash asserting that 
Cain's sign was a horn. The passage about Lamech provides the framework for the 
narrative of the death of Cain, as well as the conclusion of the tale. The horn is the motif 
around which the whole tale turns. Together the two fragments provide the necessary 
link to tradition that gives the midrash its authentic ring. In addition, this version of 
Cain's death is satisfying in a number of other respects. 

First of all, this midrash brings the tale of Cain to a conclusion. This was of no 
small importance to the rabbis, who had a strong sense that every tale should have a 
beginning, a middle, and an ending. In its biblical form, the story of Cain was simply 
incomplete. At the same time, by extending the story seven generations, the principle 
was established of carrying the biblical story into the future, and thus extending the 
history of a character beyond his or her appearance in the biblical text. Such a system 
made it possible to incorporate not only biblical exegesis, but personal dreams and 
fantasies as well into the Aggadah. 

Next, this midrash provides a unique and appropriate death for Cain, especially 
fitting in that his slayer is his own relation. This is a kind of poetic (or, perhaps, 
midrashic) justice, since Cain slew his own brother. Note, however, that neither Lamech 
nor his son, Tubal-Cain, can be held responsible for Cain's death, since Lamech was 
blind and Tubal-Cain only a child who mistook his ancestor for an animal — which, in 
essence, Cain was. It is a case of perfect justice: Cain receives his due from his own 
offspring, but they are innocent of any crime, though they have in this way repaid 
Cain for making them accursed, and in this coincidence can be seen, of course, the 



THE EVIL INCLINATION 453 


hand of God. Also, note the presence of Cain's name in that of the descendant who 
assists in killing him, hinting that Cain, in a sense, killed himself. 

Finally, this midrash aptly sets the precedent that a killer should be slain for his 
crime (contrary to an alternative interpretation that Cain repented and his repentance 
was accepted). This reading also supports the biblical injunction that the punishment 
for murder be death, and avoids setting the precedent that exceptions to this rule be 
permitted. 

It is not surprising, then, that this version of the death of Cain, which became the 
predominant one, served the needs of the ancient rabbis and accurately reflected their 
views of the need for, and the manner of, justice and retribution. All subsequent ver- 
sions of this midrash merely embellish aspects of this midrash and present the details 
in an improved narrative form, but do not change it in any essential way. 

Thus it can be seen that this midrash of Cain's death solves two problems at the 
same time: it explicates a difficult passage about Lamech, and it solves the narrative 
and moral problem of the ultimate fate of Cain. And despite its intentional usage of 
existing sources — Cain's horn and the enigmatic passage about Lamech — it still man- 
ages to be an original creation of its own.

578. THE EVIL INCLINATION 

God created two inclinations, one good and the other evil. Some say that the Evil Inclina- 
tion came into being at Adam's creation, while others say it was not until the creation of 
Eve. For when Adam's rib was taken from him, his eyes were opened and he came to know 
good and evil (Gen. 3:5). 

The Evil Inclination that resides in the human heart entices us in this world and testi- 
fies against us in the World to Come. Because of the force of the Evil Inclination, it is 
difficult to extract ones elLfrom sinful behavior. Inde ed, it is said that the greater the man, 
the greater his Evil Inclination. At first it is like the thread of a spider, but before long it 
becomes as thick as the ropes of a cart. 

The force of the Evil Inclination holds swa y in this world, and everyone is subjec t to it, 
even the angels. ForwIfenTh'e angels Shemhazai and Azazel descended to earth from 
heaven, they became visible, and they soon became subject to the Evil Inclination and 
lusted after the daughters of men. 

T he Evil In clination grows in strength from day to day, and were it not for God's help, 
no one wouldbe^ble to withstand - !!. Ihe rabbis ^ldT'Tf^oiImeet this repulsive wretch,

The Evil Inclination |ja^ev^nnames. God called it Evil. Moses called it the Uncircum- 
cised. David called it UricTeanTSoIombfr called it the Enemy. Isaiah called it the Stum- 
bling Block. Ezekiel called it Stone. And Joel called it the Hidden One. 

The Evil Inclination is one of the four things that God repented of having created. The 
others are Exile, the Chaldeans, and the Ishmaelites. 

In the days to come, God will bring forth the Evil Inclination and slay it in the presence 
of the righteous and the wicked. To the righteous it will appear as a mountain, and to the 
wicked it will have the appearance of a thread as thin as a hair. Both of them will weep. 
The righteous will weep and say, "How were we able to overcome such a towering hill?" 
And the wicked will weep and say, "How is it that we failed to conquer this thread?" 
And God, too, will marvel with them. 



454 MYTHS OF EXILE 

The Evil Inclination, or Yetzer ha-Ra, is the force of evil that is present in this world 
because of its mat erial naturg . There is also a countervailing force, less mentioned, 
known as the Yefzer ha-Tov, or the Good Inclination. According to B. Bava Batra 16a, the 
Serpent in the Garden of Eden, Satan, the Yetzer ha-Ra , and the Angel of Death are one 
and the same.

579. HOW SAMAEL ENTERED THE HEART OF MAN 

Samael, riding on the serpent, came to Eve and she conceived a child. The son that was 
bom was the son of Samael. Then Adam, who had been walking in the Garden of Eden, 
returned. He found the son of Samael crying, and he asked Eve: "Who is he?" And she 
said: "This is Samael's son." And he said to her: "Why do we need this problem here?" 
And the boy was still crying, because he wanted to make Adam angry. 

What did the first man Adam do? He stood over him and slaughtered him and cut him 
into pieces. And then every piece would yell by itself. What did Adam do? He stood and 
boiled it, and he and his wife Eve ate it. 

When Samael learned that they had eaten his son, he came to them and said, "Give me 
my boy." They said "We didn't see anything. We don't know anything." And he said to 
them: "You're lying." While they were arguing, the son of Samael spoke from the heart of 
Adam and Eve and said to Samael: "Go on your way, because I have already entered into 
their hearts, and I am not going to leave their hearts, nor the hearts of their sons, nor the 
sons of their sons, throughout the generations." 

This is a gruesome, primitive tale about the origin of evil in the human heart. The 
cannibalistic elements are shocking and seem inappropriate to Jewish tradition. The 
cruelty reflected in the myth suggests a cynical view of humanity appropriate to its 
subject matter. It draws on the midrash that the serpent conceived a child — Cain — 
with Eve. See "How Cain Was Conceived," p. 447. 

A variant is found in IFA 1141 from Yemen, where Satan brings his son to Adam in 
the shape of a sheep and gives it to him to keep for a year. When Satan doesn't return 
on time to take his sheep, Adam butchers it and eats it with challah. Then when Satan 
returns and asks for his sheep, Adam lies and says that it has run away. Satan calls his 
son and he replies from inside of Adam, and Satan leaves him there.

580. THE SONS OF GOD AND THE DAUGHTERS OF MEN 

When men began to increase on earth and daughters were bom to them, the divine beings 
saw how beautiful the daughters of men were and took wives from among those that pleased 
them. The Lord said, "My breath shall not abide in man forever, since he too is flesh; let the 
days allowed him be one hundred and twenty years." It was then, and later too, that the 
Nefilim appeared on earth, when the divine beings cohabited with the daughters of men, 
who bore them offspring. They were the heroes of old, the men of renown. 

Many of the best-known biblical episodes are found in the early portions of Gen- 
esis, prior to the story of Abraham. These include the accounts of the Creation, of 



THE SONS OF COD AND THE DAUGHTERS OF MEN 455 


Adam and Eve, of Noah, and of the Tower of Babel. But one enigmatic episode that is 
consistently overlooked is Genesis 6:1-4, concerning the Sons of God (B'nei Elohim) 
and the daughters of men. 

Like the account of the Tower of Babel, this mythic account of the mysterious Sons 
of God seems to appear from out of nowhere. Indeed, it may well be a mythic interpo- 
lation, added to explain why, a few verses later, the earth became corrupt before God 
(Gen. 6:11), much as the story of the Tower of Babel explains the origin of the many 
languages, as well as the dissemination of people over the earth.

581. THE STAR MAIDEN 

When the generation of the Flood went astray, God began to regret having created hu- 
mans. Then two angels, Shemhazai and Azazel, reminded God that they had opposed 
the creation of humans, saying. What is man , that You have been mindful of him? ( P s - 8 :5) .. 
God replied: 'Those who dwell on earth are subject to the Evil Inclination. Even you 
would be overpowered by it." But the angels protested, saying: "Let us descend to the 
world of humans, and let us show You how we will sanctify Your name." And God said: 
"Go down and dwell among them." 

So the two angels descended to earth, where they were certain they could resist the 
power of the Evil Inclination. But as soon as they saw how beautiful were the daughters 
of men, they forgot their vows and took lovers from among them, even though they were 
defiling their own pure essence. So too did they teach them secrets of how to entice men, 
as well as the dark arts of sorcery, incantations, and the divining of roots. 

Then the two angels decided to select brides for themselves from among the daugh- 
ters of men. Azazel desired Na'amah, the sister of Tubal-Cain, the most beautiful woman 
on earth. But there was another beautiful maiden, Istahar, the last of the virgins, whom 
Shemhazai desired, and she refused him. This made him want her all the more. 

"I am an angel," he revealed to her, "you cannot refuse me." 

"I will not give in to you," Istahar replied, "unless you teach me God's Ineffable Name." 

"That I cannot do," Shemhazai replied, "for it is a secret of heaven." 

"Why should I believe you?" said Istahar. "Perhaps you don't know it at all. Perhaps 
you are not really an angel." 

"Of course I know it," said Shemhazai, and he revealed God's Name. 

Now as soon as she heard the holy Name, Istahar pronounced it and flew up into the 
heavens, escaping the angel. And when God saw this, He said: "Because she removed 
herself from sin, let Istahar be set among the stars." And Istahar was transformed into a 
star, one of the brightest in the sky. And when Shemhazai saw this, he recognized God's 
rebuke of his sin and repented, hanging himself upside down between heaven and earth. 
But Azazel refused to repent, and God hung him upside down in a canyon, bound in 
chains, where he remains to this day. That is why a scapegoat is sent to Azazel on Yom 
Kippur, the Day of Atonement, bearing the sins of Israel. 

Others say that when the two angels, Shemhazai and Azazel, came down to earth, they 
were still innocent. But they were corrupted by the demonesses Na'amah and Lilith. The 
children they bore were the giants of old, known as the Nefilim, or Fallen Ones. They bore 
six children at each birth, and in that very hour their offspring stood up, spoke the holy 
language, and danced before them like sheep. There were said to be sixty in all. These 
giants had such great appetites that God rained manna on them in many different flavors, 
so that they might not eat flesh. But the Fallen Ones rejected the manna, slaughtered ani- 
mals, and even dined on human flesh. 



456 MYTHS OF EXILE 


Still others say that the offspring of the fallen angels were tall and handsome, and had 
greater strength than all the children of men. Because of the heavenly origin of their 
fathers, they are referred to as "the children of heaven." 

The primary mystery of Genesis 6 is t he identity of the Sons of God. Anthropolo- 
gists have suggested that they may have been a tribe of exceptionally tall and hand- 
some men who appeared and were irresistible to women. But the ancient rabbis were 
certain that the Sons of God were angels, although an alternate version in Aggadat 
Bereshit identifies them as the Sons of Cain. As a model, the rabbis drew on the pro- 
logue to Job, where God and Satan agree to test Job to see if he is truly righteous. Here 
God has a dialogue in heaven with two angels, Shemha zai and Azazel, who condemn 
the corrupt ways of men. God arghesthat if they live? on earth they would behave 
the same way, because everyone on earth is subject to the Yetzer ha-Ra, t he Evil Inclina - 
tion. The angels insist that they would remain righteous, and they convince God to let 
them descend to earth (in some versions, by Jacob's ladder). When they do, they are 
immediately filled with lust for the beautiful daughters of men, and use their heav- 
enly powers to satisfy their desires. And the offspring of these unions are described as 
the Nefilim, which has been interpreted to mean giants. Thus the account in Genesis 6 
also provides the origin of giants. 

In some versions of this myth, the two angels end up coming down to earth not to 
demonstrate their ability to resist the Evil Inclination, but because God cast them out 
of heaven for opposing the creation of man. According to Zohar Hadash, Ruth 81a, the 
angels acquired human form as they descended from on high. When they mated with 
human women, the "daughters of men," their offspring were the Nefilim in Genesis 
6:4, which literally means "fallen beings." 

There are many variants of the story of the two angels from a wide range of sources, 
including The Book of Enoch ( 1 Enoch) and Yalkut Shim'oni. The best-known of these 
stories concerns two maidens, Istahar and Na'amah, whom the two angels sought to 
seduce. 

Note that this story, with its fairy-tale quality, manages to explain who the Sons of 
God were, how they brought corruption to the earth, and the origin of giants. The 
story also demonstrates that no one, not even an angel, is immune to the Evil Impulse. 
Indeed, so corrupt did the angels become, that it is said that in the end they indis- 
criminately enjoyed virgins, married women, men, and beasts. The Sons of God are 
also blamed for having invented the use of ornaments, rouge, and multicolored gar- 
ments to make women more enticing. The daughters of men are identified as the chil- 
dren of Seth, Adam's son, and therefore are human (Zohar 1:37a). The heroine of the 
story is, of course, Istahar, the virgin who resisted the advances of Shemhazai, and 
was turned into a star. Istahar is a variant name for the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar, 
who was equated with the planet Venus, the brightest star. As for Na'amah, the young 
woman who is said to have overwhelmed Azazel with her beauty, she is identified as 
the sister of Tubal-Cain. In later legends, Na'amah is also identified as a sister or daugh- 
ter of Lilith. 

In most versions of this myth, Istahar demands to be told God's secret Name, the 
Tetragrammaton (YHVH). But in one alternate version in Beit ha-Midrash 5:156, which, 
because it mutes the sexual elements of the story, might be described as a midrash for 
children, she demands that he let her try on his wings. At first he denies that his wings 
come off, but when she insists, he takes them off and lets her put them on and at that 
moment she flies off into heaven and is transformed into a star. 

In later versions of this legend, the role of Shemhazai is diminished, while the role of 
Azazel is expanded, until Azazel is virtually identified with Satan. Ultimately, it is 
Shemhazai who repents and Azazel who does not. This leads to subsequent legends 
about the evil-doings of Azazel. According to Yalkut Shim'oni , Istahar became a star set 
among the seven stars of the Pleiades, while Shemhazai, hung upside down between 
heaven and earth, became the constellation Orion. Thus this myth may also be viewed 
from an astrological perspective as the origin of the constellations Pleiades and Orion. 



THE SONS OF COD AND THE DAUCHTERS OF MEN 457 


There are strong echoes of Greek mythology in the myth of the Sons of God and 
daughters of men. In bringing heavenly secrets to earth, the Sons of God function 
much as does Prometheus when he steals fire from heaven and brings it to earth. 

For more on Prometheus see Graves, The Greek Myths , 39g. There is also a strong 
parallel to the fate of Istahar in the story of Zeus setting Callisto's image among the 
stars. See Graves, The Greek Myths , 22h. See also "Adam Brings Down Fire from 
Heaven," p. 137.

582. THE WATCHERS 

There are those who say that Shemhazai and Azazel were not the only angels who de- 
scended to the face of the earth. Instead, Shemhazai was the leader of two hundred an- 
gels known as the Watchers, a high order of angels who never slept. After they descended 
to the summit of Mount Hermon, these angels swore an oath, binding themselves to- 
gether. But when the angels fell from their holy estate, they were reduced in stature as 
well as in strength, and their fiery substance became flesh. 

At first the fallen angels intended to instruct the people in the ways of righteousness. 
But when they saw the beautiful daughters of men, they lusted after them, and chose 
wives from among them. And the children bom from this union were giants. 

Each of the angels, not only Shemhazai and Azazel, revealed secrets of heaven, teaching 
charms and enchantments, incantations and the cutting of roots, astrology and the knowl- 
edge of signs. They taught men the art of working metal to make weapons, and they taught 
women how to make themselves desirable to men. So too did these angels sin with anyone 
they desired, men as well as women, beasts as well as humans, and they became corrupt in 
all ways. Before long, everything on earth became corrupted, and God ordered these fallen 
angels to be rooted out and bound in chains in the depths of the earth. 

Then the foujiarchan^ Uriel, and Raphael, went to God and re- 

countecTthe sins of the fallen angels. AnaGod said to Raphael: "Bind Azazel hand and 
foot, and cast him into a canyon in the desert Dudael, and cover him with darkness, and 
let him abide there. And on the day of Judgment he shall be cast into the fire." 

And God said to Michael: "Bind Shemhazai and his associates. Bind them fast for 
seventy generations in the valleys of the earth, till the day of judgment. Then they will be 
led to the fiery abyss and tormented and imprisoned forever." 

Still others say that Shemhazai and Azazel, alone among the angels, assumed human 
form when they descended to this world. As for the other fallen angels, they took the 
form of he-goats, serving as mounts for Shemhazai and Azazel. Later they were all cast 
into an abyss, where they still remain, imprisoned, until the end of time. 

While most versions of this myth of the Sons of God focus on two angels who 
descended from heaven, the version in The Book of Enoch states that they descended 
with an order of angels. 

The earliest embellishments of this biblical legend are found in The Book of Jubilees 
5:1-13 and 1 Enoch 6-14. The Book of Jubilees does not specify how many angels de- 
scended from heaven to earth. In 1 Enoch it says that there were 200 angels, instead of 
only two, Shemhazai (also known as Aza) and Azazel. In 1 Enoch Shemhazai is de- 
scribed as the overall leader, along with sixteen other leaders among the rebellious 
angels, including Azazel. In many ways, this legend of the fallen angels is the primary 



458 MYTHS OF EXILE 


Promethean myth in Judaism, in that the angels divulge not only dark secrets of heaven, 
but secrets of the natural universe, which God had never intended for humans to know! 
For another Promethean myth, see "Adam Brings Down Fire From Heaven," p. 137. 

As for the fate of the women who went astray with the fallen angels, 1 Enoch 19:2 
reports that they were transformed into sirens. This is a rare reference in a Jewish text 
to the sirens of Greek mythology. This is the interpretation of R. H. Charles in his 
translation of 1 Enoch. Ephraim Isaac translates this passage in The Old Testament 
Pseudepigrapha as, "And the women whom the angels have led astray will be peaceful 
ones." Considering the context of retribution, the interpretation of R. H. Charles seems 
more plausible. 

The time for this myth is said to be the days of Jared (1 Enoch 6:6). Jared was the 
father of Enoch, and the myth of the fallen angels is set in the generation before Enoch, 
but it is nevertheless an integral part of the myth of Enoch found in 1 Enoch.

583. THE GIANTS OF OLD 

The Sons of God took wives for themselves, and the women gave birth to great giants, 
the giants of old. Their height was three thousand ells. The giants quickly devoured all of 
the resources of humans. And when people could no longer sustain them, the giants 
turned against them and devoured them. And they began to sin against birds and beasts 
and reptiles and fish, and to devour one another's flesh and drink the blood. Then the 
earth made accusation against the lawless ones. 

The fallen angel Shemhazai fathered two sons, Hiwa and Hiya, who consumed a thou- 
sand oxen, a thousand camels, and a thousand horses daily. Before long the air was foul 
with the smell of carcasses. That is when God decided to cleanse the earth with the Flood. 

Some say that these giants, produced by the spirit and the flesh, are the evil spirits 
who dwell on earth, who pursue us relentlessly till this day. 

Still others describe the creation of the giants in this way: the angels transformed them- 
selves, taking the shape of men, and appeared to the women while they were with their 
husbands. And the women did not think of their husbands, but lusted in their minds 
after the forms of the fallen angels, and as a result they gave birth to giants. 

This myth elaborates on the origin of giants, called Nefilim, found in Genesis 6: The 
Nefilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in to the 
daughters of men, and they bore children to them; the same were the mighty that were of old, 
the men of renown (Gen. 6:4). The Nefilim are generally understood to refer to the an- 
cient giants. They are said to be the offspring of the Sons of God, who were under- 
stood to be fallen angels who came to earth and seduced the daughters of men. The 
giants were bom out of this union. This myth also provides the origin of the giants 
thought to dwell in the Land of Israel (Num. 12:31-33). 

While most accounts about the Nefilim attribute their birth to the mating of the 
Sons of God and the daughters of men, Zohar 1:37a attributes their birth to Samael 
having copulated with Eve, "injecting her with slime," after which "she bore Cain," 
whose features differed from other humans, and the Nefilim issued from the seed of 
Cain. See "How Cain Was Conceived," p. 447. 

An interesting alternate myth is found in the Testament of Reuben, where these gi- 
ants were said to be bom not by human women having intercourse with angels, but 
out of their fantasies about the angels, when they appeared to the women as hand- 
some men as they had sex with their husbands. This myth offers insight into rabbinic 
thinking, with the belief that fantasizing about someone else while having sex with 
one s spouse could have unexpected consequences. Here the fantasies are attributed 



THE SONS OF COD AND THE DAUCHTERS OF MEN 459 


to the women, but the rabbis, the creators of these myths, must have suspected this 
because of their own sexual fantasies. It was believed that every time a man had a 
sexual fantasy, he had intercourse with Lilith, and the results of this union were mu- 
tant demons, half human and half demon. See, for an example of a Hasidic fantasy, 
'The Woman in the Forest/' p. 219. For more on demonic offspring, see "The Cellar," 

p. 220. 

In this myth, the giants are conceived by the union of angels and human women, 
while in Greek myth the giants are said to have sprung from a union between Earth 
and Tartarus (Hades). See Graves, The Greek Myths , 4a.

584. A LECHEROUS SPIRIT 

King Solomon captured the demon Omasis and made him reveal the names of all the 
other spirits and demons. One by one Solomon called them up and interrogated them. 
One of the spirits he invoked came forth in the shadowy form of a man with gleaming 
eyes. "Who are you?" King Solomon asked. The spirit replied, "l am a lecherous spiri t of 
a giantw ho died in a massacre in the age of giants." Solomon said, "Where do you dwell?" 
The spirit replied, "I live in inaccessible places. I seat myself near the dead in their tombs 
and at midnight I assume the form of the dead. If I encounter anyone, I cause him to be 
possessed by a demon." And when he heard these things. King Solomon locked up that 
demon, just like all the other demons he had called forth. 

King Solomon questions a series of demons and spirits in The Testament of Solomon, 
which is a kind of demonic bestiary. One of the spirits who comes forth is this lecher- 
ous spirit who once was a giant in the time of giants alluded to in Genesis 6: The 
Nefilim were in the earth in those days , and also after that, when the sons of God came in to the 
daughters of men, and they bore children to them; the same were the mighty men that were of 
old, the men of renown. Here " Nefilim " are understood to be giants. See "The Giants of 
Old," p. 458. For other stories about giants, see "The Giant Og," p. 461. For the frame 
story in The Testament of Solomon about the capture of Ornasis, see "The Vampire De- 
mon," p. 227.

585. THE LAIR OF AZAZEL 

The generation of the Deluge learned the ways of evil from the fallen angel Azazej, He 
taught men how to make deadly weapons and women how to arouse the desires of men. 
They followed his teachings until the whole earth became corrupt. Therefore, at the time 
of the Deluge, God command ed the ang el Raphael to bind Azazel hand and foot and cast 
him into the darkness. Thereto rel^aphael made a hole in the desert Dudael/beyond the 
Mountains of Darkness, and cast Azazel there, chained upside down in the dark. 

Even there, Azazel did not repent, but was consumed by thoughts of revenge. Using 
the power of d reams, he sought out an gviLsorcerei/ and commanded him to come to 
him. First this sorcerer had to find his way to the Mountains of Darkness. There he was 
met by a de mon in the shape of a cat, with the head of a fiery serpent, and two tails. The 
magicians theivtodk^T&gt;dwt containing the ashes of a white cock, and cast the ashes at the 
catlike demon. Then the demon led him to the place where Azazel was chained. There 



460 MYTHS OF EXILE 


he lit incense and stepped on the chain of Azazel three times. Then he closed his eyes, fell 
to his knees, and worshipped the fallen angel. That is when Azazel began to speak, re- 
vealing the darkest mysteries for fifty days. By then there was none among the living 
with a greater mastery of evil. Bowing farewell, the evil sorcerer was led out of the Moun- 
tains of Darkness by the catlike demon with the head of a fiery serpent. He, in turn, 
revealed the secret of where Azazel was hidden to other sorcerers, who sought out the 
fallen angel, and were tutored by him in the ways of evil. Thus did the black arts make 
their way into the world. 

The myth of the Sons of God and the daughters of men also provides one more 
useful identification— that of the mysterious identity of Azazel. In Leviticus 1 6:8. 10. 
and 16 there are references to sending a scapegoat to Azazel on Yom Kippur: Butttie ' 
goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, shall be set alive before Yahweh, to make expiation with it 
and to send it off to the wilderness for Azazel (Lev. 16:10). This Azazel is usually identified 
as another name for Satan. Even today, Israelis tell someone to "Go to Hell!" by saying 
"Lekh le-Azazel\" Thus the myth of the descent of the two angels provides an explana- 
tion as to the identity and punishment of Azazel, the angel who refused to repent and 
thus was chained upside down in a canyon, where he continued to plot evil deeds. 

Nachmanides, in his commentary on Leviticus 16:8, writes that the scapegoat is sent 
to the prince who rules over places of destruction," a demon or a fallen angel known as 
Azazel, also known as Samael. This suggests that the goat is not sacrificed to God, but to 
some other divine entity named Azazel. The purpose of sending the scapegoat is to 
bribe Satan, the Accuser, the prosecutor of the Jewish people, to be silent on Yom Kip- 
pur, through this gift of the people's sins in the form of the goat. The problem, of course, 
is that the offering of the scapegoat to Azazel could be construed as an idolatrous act. 
Nachmanides solves this problem by asserting that the scapegoat is not given to Azazel 
by the Jewish people, but by God, as a reward for his cessation of his activity as Accuser 
on the Day of Atonement. Hyam Maccoby considers the gift to Azazel of the scapegoat 
a remnant of paganism, i.e., the worship of the god of the desert. 

While 1 Enoch singles out Azazel for punishment in the desert Dudael, the version 
of this legend found in Emek ha-Melekh identifies both Aza (Shemhazai) and Azazel as 
being chained together there. This contradicts most versions of the legend, in which 
Shemhazai repents, and hangs himself (or is hung by God) upside down between 
heaven and ea rth, while it is Azazel alone who remains unrepentant, and takes on a 
role quite surular to that of Satan. Here the myths of Satan, Lucifer, Azazel, and Samael 
all converge in the story of a heavenly outcast who comes to rule the underworld. 

Some sources, such as Zohar 2:157b, interpret the references to "Azazel" in Leviticus 
as referring to a mountain called Azazel, not a fallen angel. This mountain was said to 
be a great and mighty one, and below it are unimaginable depths, where no one has 
ever gone. There the Other Side has unshackled power. It seems likely that the offer- 
ing of the scapegoat in this Yom Kippur ritual is the remnant of some kind of sacrifice 
to an evil god in order to placate it. 

All in all, the myth of the Sons of God and daughters of men is quite useful in the 
way it provides midrashic explanations for many problems: the identity of the Sons of 
God in Genesis 6; the reason for the corruption of the generation of the Flood; the 
origin of giants; an astrological explanation for the star that Istahar became and the 
constellation of Orion, linked to Shemhazai when he hung himself upside down; as 
well as the identity of Azazel. The original biblical myth only provided a few of these 
explanations, but the rabbinic embellishments added many others, as well as some 
memorable stories about lustful angels and the brave virgin Istahar— whose Babylonian 
prototype was not exactly noted for her chastity.

THE FLOOD 461 


586. THE GIANT OG 

When all of the animals had boarded the ark, the giant Og, King of Bashan, swore to 
Noah and his sons that if they would take him with them on the ark, he would be their 
servant forever. What did Noah do? He let the giant sit on the roof of the ark, and bored 
a hole in the roof, and passed the giant his daily food through it. That is how Og, alone 
among the giants, escaped from the Flood by riding on top of the ark, as it is said. Only 
King Og of was left of the remaining Refaim (Deut. 3:11). 

Later, as King of Bashan, Og became an enemy of Israel. He is said to have uprooted a 
mountain and held it over the heads of the Israelites. The mountain was large enough to 
kill all of them at once. But God sent a swarm of rock-eating ants against him, who bored 
through the mountain, so that it fell from his hands and slipped over his neck. Because 
his teeth jutted out, he could not remove it. Then Moses, who was ten feet tall, jumped 
another ten feet into the air and struck Og on the ankle with a hammer (others say with a 
lance or a nail) and knocked him down. And because of the weight of the mountain he 
could not rise again and perished. As for the mountain, when Og fell down dead the 
mountain fell off his shoulders, and it was about to fall upon Israel. But Moses prayed to 
God, and some say he took a small tree and placed it under the mountain and prevented 
it from falling upon the people, while others say that thanks to God the mountain was 
suspended between heaven and earth. 

It is said that Og's skeleton was found by Abba Shaul. Abba Shaul, who buried the 
dead, once saw a deer and chased after it. The deer entered a hole in the ground and he 
followed it down the hole. The hole led into the thigh bone of a skeleton. He chased the 
deer for three miles inside the thighbone, and it still didn't come to an end. So he gave up 
and turned back. Later, he learned that was the skeleton of Og, King of Bashan. 

But some say that Og managed to survive, and in his wanderings he came to Poland in 
the winter. Not used to such cold weather, Og looked for a tailor, and when he found one, 
he demanded that the tailor make him a coat to keep him warm. He asked the terrified 
tailor how long it would take to make the coat, and the tailor, seeing the size of the giant, 
said it would take about a week. Og got angry and said that if the coat wasn't ready in a 
week, he would trample the town to dust. The frightened tailor gathered all the people of 
the town together and told them of the giant's demand. So the inhabitants scurried off to 
neighboring towns and brought back every tailor they could find. An army of tailors 
then set to work on the giant coat, finishing just in time. Suddenly they heard the giant 
approach. With nowhere else to hide, they jumped inside the pockets of the coat. Og 
picked up the coat, put it on, and placed his hands into the pockets to warm them, squeez- 
ing all the tailors together. Then, warm for the first time since coming to Poland, Og lay 
down to sleep and the terrified tailors escaped. But thereafter every one of them had a 
pale face. And that is why tailors have pale faces. As for Og, some say he is still wander- 
ing the earth. 

The origin of giants is recounted in Genesis 6:4: It was then, and later too, that the 
Nefilim appeared on earth. The Nefilim are understood to be giants who were the off- 
spring of the mating of the Sons of God and the daughters of men recounted in Gen- 
esis 6. 

The story about the giant Og and Noah's ark serves to explain how giants were 
able to survive the Flood. It is also one of several tales about the giant Og, who was 
slain by Moses. Og is also identified as the King of Bashan who was the last of the 
remaining Refaim, understood to mean "giants," as stated in Deuteronomy 3:11. 

Most of the tales about Og portray him as an enemy of Israel, but in this childlike 
story about Og and the ark, Og is a friendly if demanding giant. In other accounts Og 



462 MYTHS OF EXILE 


holds a mountain over Israel, threatening to crush them. He even engages in combat 
with Moses. According to one of these accounts, in Bereshit Rabbah 42:8, it was Og who 
told Abraham that his nephew Lot had been captured (see Genesis 14:13), in hope that 
Abraham would be slain when he went off to fight the kings who had captured Lot, 
for Og hoped to marry Sarah. See the commentary on "God Offers the Torah to Is- 
rael," p. 264 for more about Og's role as an enemy of Israel. 

The combat between Moses and Og recalls that between David and Goliath. David 
defeats Goliath with a sling, a child's weapon. In the case of Og, the giant is defeated 
by the smallest of opponents, the ants, who burrow through the mountain he intends 
to use to crush Israel, causing it to collapse on him. Moses then completes the con- 
quest by leaping up and striking a blow to Og's ankle, killing him. The moral of this 
story, like that of David and Goliath, seems clear: little Israel, a tiny nation, is able to 
defeat much greater adversaries. This is possible because of God's support, and be- 
cause of the bravery and unity the people show in the face of adversity. This moral is 
emphasized by the ants, tiny creatures who, by working together, defeat a giant.

587. NOAH AND THE RAVEN 

The first bird that Noah called upon to go forth from the ark and search for land was the 
raven, as it is said, Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made and sent out the raven; 
it went to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth (Gen. 8:6-7). 

But was the raven willing to go? Some say that when Noah called upon the raven to go 
forth from the ark, the raven was incensed. It began to argue with Noah, saying, "Of all 
the birds in the ark, why do you pick on me? Your Master hates me since He commanded 
you to bring seven pairs of the clean creatures into the ark, but only one pair of the 
unclean, like me. You hate me because you could have chosen any one of the species of 
which there are seven pairs, but instead you chose me. What if the Angel of Heat or the 
Angel of Cold should smite me, wouldn't the world be short one kind? So why is it that 
you chose me? Or do you desire my mate?" 

Others say that when Noah sent forth the raven to determine the state of the world, it 
went forth to and fro (Gen. 8:7) until it found a carcass of a man upon the summit of a 
mountain. It settled there and did not return to the ark. That is when Noah called upon 
the dove, and sent it forth. 

One of the requirements that God gives to Noah concerns the beasts he is to bring 
into the ark: Of every clean beast you shall take seven and seven , each with his mate; and of 
the unclean beasts , two and two , each with his mate (Gen. 7:2). This passage seems to 
allude to the system of Kosher laws, based on Leviticus 11:47. 

In one version, given here, the raven demonstrates great anger at Noah's order that 
it go forth to see if the waters of the Flood have receded. It even accuses Noah of 
desiring its mate. In another version, the raven goes forth, and the first thing it finds 
to feast on is the corpse of a man. In both versions the raven is portrayed as evil, while 
the dove is portrayed as good. Thus the kind of good and evil polar figures that are 
found among humans, such as Esau and Jacob or Lilith and Eve, are here mirrored in 
the rabbinic interpretations of the account of the raven in the story of the Flood. 

There are many fables in rabbinic literature and in later Jewish folklore. These fables 
include many speaking animals, but rarely do they speak, as in this midrash about 



THE TOWER OF BABEL 463 


Noah, with a human being. There are also many other Jewish fables about the raven. 
The twelfth century fabulist Berekhiah ha-Nakdan includes in his Mishle Shualim le- 
Rabbi Berekhiah ha-Nakdan several fables about ravens. See Fables of a Jewish Aesop , trans- 
lated by Moses Hadas. 

This midrash can be seen to have an environmental perspective, as the raven ar- 
gues that since there are only he and his mate, should he die, one species might be 
lost. Even though the argument comes from the raven, the question is resonant enough 
to reflect a real concern of the rabbis for preserving the natural environment. 

Bernard Malamud's short story, "The Jewbird," portrays a talking bird much in the 
caustic spirit of the raven in these rabbinic texts. See Malamud's The Complete Stories , 
pp. 322-330.

588. THE FIERY DELUGE 

Strange as it may seem, the generation of the Flood was punished by fire, not by water. 
For every single drop of rain that God brought down on them had first been boiled in the 
fires of Gehenna. Thus it was not the Deluge that took their lives, but the fact that the 
water was boiling. Why such a terrible punishment? Led astray by the angels known as 
the Sons of God who had descended to earth and corrupted them, the generation of the 
Flood sinned with hot passion, and therefore were punished with boiling water. 

It is said that boiling water descended from above, while cold water rushed from be- 
low, washing away those who were rebellious and causing them to perish. 

Viewing the generation of the Flood as evil, this midrash transforms the flood from 
one of rain to one of fire, the fire of Gehenna. Thus, for their sins, the fires of hell were 
rained upon them. Likewise, the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, another evil 
generation, were exterminated by fire that rained down on them from on high. The 
image of fire raining down from heaven is found in Genesis 19:24.

589. THE TOWER OF BABEL 

Everyone on earth had the same language and the same words. And as they migrated 
from the east, they came upon a valley in the land of Shinar and settled there. They said 
to one another, "Come, let us make bricks and bum them hard." Brick served them as 
stone, and bitumen served them as mortar. And they said, "Come, let us build us a city, 
and a tower with its top in the sky, to make a name for ourselves; else we shall be scat- 
tered all over the world." The Lord came down to look at the city and tower that man had 
built, and the Lord said, "If, as one people with one language for all, this is how they 
have begun to act, then nothing that they may propose to do will be out of their reach. Let 
us, then, go down and confound their speech there, so that they shall not understand one 
another's speech." Thus the Lord scattered them from there over the face of the whole 
earth; and they stopped building the city. That is why it was called Babel, because there 
the Lord confounded the speech of the whole earth; and from there the Lord scattered 
them over the face of the whole earth. 



464 MYTHS OF EXILE 


This is an origin myth that both explains the origin of many languages and the 
wide dissemination of people around the world. The mystery about this myth is why 
God feels so threatened by the attempts of the people to build a tower into heaven. 
After all, it is a peaceful endeavor and requires cooperation. The stated purpose of the 
people is simply to make a name for themselves. But God clearly feels that their true 
intention is to overthrow heaven and so descends to confuse their languages and scat- 
ter them abroad. Rabbinic commentaries on the Tower of Babel emphasize the malig- 
nant intentions of the builders. See "Building the Tower," which follows. 

Archaeologists have identified the Tower of Babel with the ziggurat structures built 
in Mesopotamia, which resembled high towers to heaven. This seems like the likely 
source of the myth.

590. BUILDING THE TOWER 

The builders of the Tower of Babel spoke a universal language, as it is said, Everyone on 
earth had the same language and the same words (Gen. 11:1). With this miraculous language 
anything could be accomplished. Some say they had but to speak, and instantly their work 
was done. This universal language was lost when God scattered the builders and confused 
their tongues, but this same language will be spoken in the future, in the messianic era. 

Others say everything went well for these builders, andlheirwork prospered in their 
hands. A man who came to lay one stone found that he had laid two, and one who came 
to plaster two rows found that he had plastered four. 

Why did they build the tower? Some say they believed that the firmament was in 
danger of tottering, and the tower they built was to be one of four pillars to support the 
heavens. That was the eastern pillar, and others were to be built in the north, in the south, 
and in the west. 

Others say that they built the tower out of fear of another Flood. They hoped to avoid 
the waters of the Flood by inhabiting the heights of the tower, and they took axes with 
them to cleave the heavens, so that all the waters stored there would run out before God 
could cause them to flood. 

Still others say that they intended to overthrow heaven, to prevent God from bringing 
another Flood on the world. They argued that God had no right to choose the celestial 
spheres for Himself and assign the terrestrial world t o them. They set an idol at the top of 
the tower, with a sword in its hana, as a sign that they mtended to wage war against the 
King of heaven, and to dwell there in His place. So too did they shoot arrows into heaven, 
which fell back dripping blood, which convinced them that the defeat of heaven was 
close at hand. 

The builders of the tower were split up into three groups. Those who intended to live 
peacefully were scattered over the face of the earth. Those who intended to wage war 
against heaven were turned into evil spirits, demons, wraiths, and liliyot (female demons 
of the night). And those who intended to worship idols had their languages confounded, 
and could no longer communicate with each other. 

As for the fate of the tower, one third was consumed by fire, one third sank into the 
Wrth, and the remaining third still stands as a warning against challenging heaven. Even 
this third is so tall that from the top palm trees resemble locusts. Nor did the tower ever 
jose its power over mankind. Whoever passes there forgets all that he knows. 



SODOM AND GOMORRAH 465 


The ancient rabbis felt a strong need to justify God's decision to confuse the lan- 
guage of the builders of the Tower of Babel and scatter them throughout the world. 
Although the biblical account does not contain any direct references to the people desir- 
ing to overthrow heaven, this is the interpretation found in the midrashic texts. Here 
their plans and actions are presented in vivid terms, with arrows being shot into heaven 
and falling back dripping blood — as God deceived them into believing that they were 
going to defeat heaven and take it over. With these kinds of details, the subsequent 
punishment does not seem excessive, but rather merciful. Here, too, a portion of the 
tower remains to remind the people of the hubris of the builders of the tower.

591. THE DESTRUCTION OF SODOM AND GOMORRAH 

The two angels arrived in Sodom in the evening, as Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. 
When Lot saw them, he rose to greet them and, bowing low with his face to the ground, 
he said, "Please, my lords, turn aside to your servant's house to spend the night, and 
bathe your feet; then you may be on your way early." But they said, "No, we will spend 
the night in the square." But he urged them strongly, so they turned his way and entered 
his house. He prepared a feast for them and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. 

They had not yet lain down, when the townspeople, the men of Sodom, young and 
old — all the people to the last man — gathered about the house. And they shouted to Lot 
and said to him, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that 
we may be intimate with them." So Lot went out to them to the entrance, shut the door 
behind him, and said, "I beg you, my friends, do not commit such a wrong. Look, I have 
two daughters who have not known a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you may 
do to them as you please; but do not do anything to these men, since they have come 
under the shelter of my roof." But they said, "Stand back! The fellow," they said, "came 
here as an alien, and already he acts the ruler! Now we will deal worse with you than 
with them." And they pressed hard against the person of Lot, and moved forward to 
break the door. But the men stretched out their hands and pulled Lot into the house with 
them, and shut the door. And the people who were at the entrance of the house, young 
and old, they struck with blinding light, so that they were helpless to find the entrance. 

Then the men said to Lot, "Whom else have you here? Sons-in-law, your sons and 
daughters, or anyone else that you have in the city — bring them out of the place. For we 
are about to destroy this place; because the outcry against them before the Lord has be- 
come so great that the Lord has sent us to destroy it." So Lot went out and spoke to his 
sons-in-law, who had married his daughters, and said, "Up, get out of this place, for the 
Lord is about to destroy the city." But he seemed to his sons-in-law as one who jests. 

As dawn broke, the angels urged Lot on, saying, "Up, take your wife and your two 
remaining daughters, lest you be swept away because of the iniquity of the city." Still he 
delayed. So the men seized his hand, and the hands of his wife and his two daughters — 
in the Lord 's mercy on him — and brought him out and left him outside the city. When 
they had brought them outside, one said, "Flee for your life! Do not look behind you, nor 
stop anywhere in the Plain; flee to the hills, lest you be swept away." But Lot said to 
them, "Oh no, my lord! You have been so gracious to your servant, and have already 
shown me so much kindness in order to save my life; but I cannot flee to the hills, lest the 
disaster overtake me and I die. Look, that town there is near enough to flee to; it is such 
a little place! Let me flee there — it is such a little place — and let my life be saved." He 



466 MYTHS OF EXILE 


replied, "Very well, I will grant you this favor too, and I will not annihilate the town of 
which you have spoken. Hurry, flee there, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there." 
Hence the town came to be called Zoar. 

As the sun rose upon the earth and Lot entered Zoar, the Lord rained upon Sodom and 
Gomorrah sulfurous fire from the Lord out of heaven. He annihilated those cities and the 
entire Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities and the vegetation of the ground. Lot's 
wife looked back, and she thereupon turned into a pillar of salt. 

Next morning, Abraham hurried to the place where he had stood before the Lord, and, 
looking down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land of the Plain, he saw the 
smoke of the land rising like the smoke of a kiln. 

Despite Abraham's efforts to convince God to spare Sodom in Genesis 18:17-33, it 
was destroyed along with the city of Gomorrah. Lot's wife, who is given the name 
Edith in the Midrash, was turned into a pillar of salt when she disobeyed the com- 
mand of the angels not to look back. The account in Genesis makes it clear that the 
inhabitants of these cities were sinners, and the midrashim about this episode go even 
further. After all, this is a city where Lot offers his virgin daughters to a mob as a 
means of protecting his guests. This is a perverted kind of hospitality, the opposite of 
the kind of hospitality Abraham demonstrated in Genesis 18 when he welcomed the 
same angels to his tent. 

The destruction of Sodom and Gemorah is parallel to the destruction wrought by 
the Flood, though on a smaller scale. Like the Flood, it stands as an example of God's 
anger when provoked by sin on a large scale. Later rabbinic tradition described God 
as having two thrones, a Throne of Justice and a Throne of Mercy. It was when He was 
seated on the Throne of Justice that God demonstrated harsh justice, as shown here.

592. THE BANISHED ANGELS 

Angels must have God's permission to reveal any of the secrets of heaven. But the two 
angels who went to Sodom, to the home of Lot and his wife, revealed a secret of the Lord. 
And because they revealed this secret, they were banished from heaven. What secret did 
they reveal? God's intention of destroying Sodom, as it is said, for Yahweh is about to de- 
stroy the city (Gen. 19:14). They wandered in exile for one hundred and thirty-eight years. 
Their banishment only came to an end on the night that Jacob dreamed of the ladder that 
reached from earth to heaven. For they were among the angels who ascended on that 
^(G ^ aS ^ aC °k ^ reame&lt; ^ a b°ut it, as it is said, and angels of God ascending and descending on 

Here the angels who reveal God s intention to destroy Sodom to Lot are said to have 
been punished by being exiled from heaven for 138 years. This myth is parallel to that of 
the rabbinic myths about two angels, Shemhazai and Azazel, the Sons of God of Gen- 
esis 6, who were said to have descended to earth and revealed a great many secrets of 
heaven. They too were punished for their sins. This myth, found in Targum Pseudo- 
Yonathan, explains that the punishment of the two angels came to an end when Jacob 
had his dream of the ladder reaching to heaven, and that they were among the angels 
ascending on it. This one myth, then, looks back at one biblical episode, that of the Sons 
of God and the daughters of men, and forward, to Jacob's dream. This linking of biblical 
episodes is one of the primary functions of this kind of exegesis.

MYTHS OF THE EXODUS 467 


593. THE PILLAR OF SALT 

The angels told Lot and his family not to look back when they left Sodom. When Lot's 
wife disobeyed and looked back, she was turned into a pillar of salt, as it is said. Lot's wife 
looked back , and she thereupon turned into a pillar of salt (Gen. 19:26). But why did she look 
back? And why was she turned into a pillar of salt? 

Some say that Lot's wife, whose name was Edith, looked behind her to see if her daugh- 
ters, who were married to men of Sodom, were coming after her or not. So too did she 
want to know what would be the end of her father's house. Instead, she saw God, who 
had descended in order to rain brimstone and fire upon Sodom and Gomorrah. And that 
is why she was turned into a pillar of salt. 

Others say that because she sinned with salt. Lot's wife was punished with salt. On 
the night that the angels visited Lot, Lot prepared a feast for them, as he had learned 
hospitality from Abraham, and he asked his wife to give them a little salt. She grew angry 
and said, "Do you want to introduce that evil practice of giving strangers salt?" Then she 
went to all of her neighbors asking for salt. In this way she alerted them to the presence of 
the guests, and precipitated the mob who demanded that Lot turn the angels over to 
them. Thus, because she sinned with salt, she was punished with salt. 

As for the pillar of salt, it still can be seen to this day. All day oxen lick it and it de- 
creases until nothing remains but her feet. But in the morning the pillar of salt grows 
afresh. Those who see it are required to say the benediction to be pronounced on seeing 
Lot's wife, "Blessed be He who wrought miracles for our ancestors in this place." 

The transformation of Lot's wife into a pillar of salt is one of the most striking 
images in the Bible. There still exists a pillar of salt near the Dead Sea that is identified 
as Lot's wife. In the Mishnah this is said to be one of the places where a blessing 
should be said. Other places listed in the Talmud (B. Ber. 54a) include the place of the 
crossing of the Red Sea and the walls of Jericho that sank into the ground. 

Why was Lot's wife transformed into a pillar of salt? Of course, she did disobey the 
angel's command not to look back, but the real reason for her punishment seems to be 
because in doing so she saw God, who had descended to destroy the city.

594. THE GOLDEN CALF 

When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, the 
people gathered against Aaron and said to him, "Come, make us a god who shall go 
before us, for that man Moses, who brought us from the land of Egypt — we do not know 
what has happened to him." Aaron said to them, "Take off the gold rings that are on the 
ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me." And all the 
people took off the gold rings that were in their ears and brought them to Aaron. These 
he took from them and cast in a mold, and made it into a molten calf. And they ex- 
claimed, "This is your god, O Israel, who brought you out of the land of Egypt!" When 
Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron announced: "Tomorrow shall be a 
festival of the Lord!" Early next day, the people offered up burnt offerings and brought 
sacrifices of well-being; they sat down to eat and drink, and then rose to dance. 

The Lord spoke to Moses, "Hurry down, for your people, whom you brought out of 
the land of Egypt, have acted basely. They have been quick to turn aside from the way 



468 MYTHS OF EXILE 


that I enjoined upon them. They have made themselves a molten calf and bowed low to 
it and sacrificed to it, saying: 'This is your god, O Israel, who brought you out of the land 
of Egypt!'" 

The Lord further said to Moses, "I see that this is a stiff-necked people. Now, let Me be, 
that My anger may blaze forth against them and that I may destroy them, and make of 
you a great nation. " But Moses implored the Lord his God, saying, "Let not Your anger, O 
Lord, blaze forth against Your people, whom You delivered from the land of Egypt with 
great power and with a mighty hand. Let not the Egyptians say, 'It was with evil intent 
that He delivered them, only to kill them off in the mountains and annihilate them from 
the face of the earth.' Turn from Your blazing anger, and renounce the plan to punish 
Your people. Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, how You swore to 
them by Your Self and said to them: I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars 
of heaven, and I will give to your offspring this whole land of which I spoke, to possess 
forever." And the Lord renounced the punishment He had planned to bring upon His 
people. 

Thereupon Moses turned and went down from the mountain bearing the two tablets 
of the Pact, tablets inscribed on both their surfaces: they were inscribed on the one side 
and on the other. The tablets were God's work, and the writing was God's writing, in- 
scribed upon the tablets. When Joshua heard the sound of the people in its boisterous- 
ness, he said to Moses, "There is a cry of war in the camp." But he answered, "It is not the 
sound of the tune of triumph, or the sound of the tune of defeat; it is the sound of song 
that I hear!" 

As soon as Moses came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, he became 
enraged; and he hurled the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the 
mountain. He took the calf that they had made and burned it; he ground it to powder 
and strewed it upon the water and so made the Israelites drink it. 

Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you that you have brought such 
great sin upon them?" Aaron said, "Let not my lord be enraged. You know that this 
people is bent on evil. They said to me, 'Make us a god to lead us; for that man Moses, 
who brought us from the land of Egypt — we do not know what has happened to him.' So 
I said to them, 'Whoever has gold, take it off!' They gave it to me and I hurled it into the 
fire and out came this calf!" 

Moses saw that the people were out of control— since Aaron had let them get out of 
control so that they were a menace to any who might oppose them. Moses stood up in 
the g3te of the camp and said. Whoever is for the Lord, come here!" And all the Levites 
rallied to him. He said to them, "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: 'Each of you put 
sword on thigh, go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay brother, 
neighbor, and kin.'" The Levites did as Moses had bidden; and some three thousand of 
the people fell that day. And Moses said, "Dedicate yourselves to the Lord this day— for 
each of you has been against son and brother — that He may bestow a blessing upon you 
today." 

The next day Moses said to the people, "You have been guilty of a great sin. Yet I will 
now go up to the Lord; perhaps I may win forgiveness for your sin." Moses went back to 
the Lord and said, Alas, this people is guilty of a great sin in making for themselves a 
god of gold. Now, if You will forgive their sin well and good; but if not, erase me from the 
record that You have written!" But the Lord said to Moses, "He who has sinned against 
Me, him only will I erase from My record. Go now, lead the people where I told you. See, 
My angel shall go before you. But when I make an accounting, I will bring them to ac- 
count for their sins." 

Then the Lord sent a plague upon the people, for what they did with the calf that 
Aaron made. 



MYTHS OF THE EXODUS 469 


The faith of the Israelites was constantly being tested by difficult conditions and 
the people continually failed the tests. Here they revert to pagan worship, forcing 
Aaron to build a golden calf they can worship. Such idols were often worshipped in 
the ancient Near East. As a result, both God and Moses punish the people. This fa- 
mous myth emphasizes how difficult it was for the people to abandon paganism for 
monotheism, and how they were tempted to revert to paganism at the very time that 
God was dictating the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai.

595. STRANGE FIRE 

Whenever Aaron officiated at a sacrifice, the fire of the Lord would descend to consume 
the burnt offering, and the Glory of the Lord appeared to all the people. When the people 
saw this, they fell upon their faces and sang a song of praise. 

But Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, said to each other, "When our father and 
uncle Moses die, we shall be the chiefs of the people." After that Aaron's sons Nadab and 
Abihu each took his fire pan , put fire in it , and laid incense on it; and they offered before Yahweh 
alien fire, which He had not enjoined upon them. And fire came forth from Yahweh and consumed 
them; thus they died before Yahweh (Lev. 10:1-2). Thus their souls were burnt and they paid 
the price for their disrespect of God. 

It is said that as long as Israel is in exile, and cannot sacrifice two goats on Yom Kippur, 
the two sons of Aaron may be a memorial of the sacrifice, and Israel may be atoned 
through them. 

Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, were, like their father, priests. They had been 
anointed and were allowed to perform service in the Tabernacle. Their mysterious deaths 
occurred when they introduced "strange fire" into the Tabernacle. This incident is re- 
ferred to twice, in Leviticus 10:1 and Numbers 3:4, the former explaining that they had 
lit incense and performed a service that they had not been commanded to perform. 

Since they entered the Tent of Meeting for an improper purpose, they were punished 
with death. The deaths are said to have been by a fire that came forth from heaven, the 
same fire referred to in Leviticus 9:24 that consumed the burnt offering. 

There are several explanations given for their deaths. In Exodus Rabbah it is said 
that they behaved in a brazen manner, uncovering their heads and eating and drink- 
ing in the presence of God, as it is said. They beheld God and ate and drank (Exod. 24:11). 

This is contrasted with the respectful behavior of Moses at the burning bush, when 
Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God (Exod. 3:6). Leviticus Rabbah 12:1 sug- 
gests that they might have been drunk. Leviticus Rabbah 20:10 suggests that Nadab 
and Abihu were impatient to replace Moses and Aaron, and wished them an early 
death. God, in turn, brought Nadab and Abihu an early death. Still other reasons are 
given in Leviticus Rabbah 20:8-10 — some say they penetrated to the inmost portion of 
the sanctuary, or that they brought an offering they were not commanded to bring, or 
entered the sanctuary without washing their hands and feet, or they did not wear the 
required number of garments, or they brought alien fire, that is, not from the sacrifi- 
cial altar. The most serious accusation is that they "fed their eyes on the Shekhinah." 

This implies that they did not take their great responsibility seriously or show the 
proper respect before God. Thus the tale of Nadab and Abihu became a warning tale 
about the great care that the priest must take in preparing an offering to God. 



470 MYTHS OF EXILE 


Zohar 1:73a asserts that Aaron's sons drank wine in the Holy of Holies, the same 
wine that intoxicated Noah. One commentary on the Zohar, Ziv ha-Zohar, identifies 
this destructive wine with secular knowledge. 

The linkage between the deaths of Aaron's sons and the biblical ritual of sacrificing 
the two goats on Yom Kippur grows out of the fact that the chapter beginning Yahweh 
spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron (Lev. 16:1) prescribes the Yom 
Kippur ritual. For a description of the ritual of sacrificing the goats, see "A Scapegoat 
for Azazel," p. 295.

596. THE SPIRIT OF IDOLATRY 

When the Israelites returned from the Babylonian exile, they found the Temple in Jerusalem 
destroyed and cried in a loud voice to Yahweh their God (Neh. 9:4). They said: "Woe, woe, it is the 
evil spirit of idolatry that has destroyed the Sanctuary, burnt the Temple, killed all tire righ- 
teous, and driven Israel into exile. And behold, he is still dancing among us." And they 
prayed to die Lord: "You, who brought this evil spirit into being so that we could receive a 
reward through resisting him — we want neither him, nor the reward!" Thereupon a tablet 
fell from heaven among them, on which the word "Truth" (emet) was inscribed. 

After this miracle had taken place, the people fasted for three days and nights, and at the 
end of that time the spirit of idolatry was delivered into their hands, and he came forth out 
of the Holy of Holies in the form of a fiery lion. But they approached him and plucked out 
one of his hairs, causing the lion to raise his voice and roar so loudly it could be heard for 
four hundred parasangs. And when the people heard this, they said among themselves: 
"Let us hope that heaven does not have mercy upon him." Then they cast the lion into a 
huge leaden pot, and sealed its only opening with lead, because lead absorbs sound. 

They imprisoned the evil spirit for three days, then they discovered that there was not 
a fresh egg in all of the land. From this they realized that if they killed him, the whole 
world would end. So they blinded him and let him go. 

Here a paradox about the nature of sexuality and creation is presented, since this 
myth clearly indicates that they both spring from evil. The spirit that is captured in 
this talmudic tale is the incarnation of the Yetzer ha-Ra, the Evil Inclination. (There also 
is a Good Inclination, the Yetzer ha-Tov.) Rabbinic literature shows considerable ambi- 
guity on this subject. While always urging that this impulse be resisted, the rabbis 
also recognized its essential role in the world, as this tale makes clear. Here the spirit 
of idolatry is overcome and captured. It is only then, however, that the people dis- 
cover its role in the divine scheme — for without the Evil Impulse, the Yetzer ha-Ra, 
sexual desire in all creatures ceased, causing all procreation to stop. And not only 
fertility, but creativity was also lost. Had this continued, all animal life would have 
died out. In this way the rabbis acknowledge a necessary and perhaps even positive 
role for the Evil Inclination. Note the strongly mythical aspects of this tale, in which 
the Evil Impulse is personified as a fiery lion. It has strong echoes of the rabbinic 
legends about the golden calf, which was said to have come alive and charged around 
out of control ( Midrash Shir ha-Shirim 13a-13b and Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 45). The roar- 
ing of the lion in this tale is reminiscent of that in the well-known talmudic tale, "The 
Lion of the Forest Ilai." See "The Lion of the Forest Ilai," p. 149. 

The blinding of the spirit of idolatry is intended to indicate that the Jews curbed 
the unbridled passion of the Yetzer ha-Ra. Since they could not destroy the impulse — 
all earthly propagation depended on it— they attempted to curb it instead. 



MYTHS OF THE EXODUS 471 


Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav regarded the spirit of Idolatry as the evil angel who 
causes sexual lust. He identifies the blinding with the self-restraint of those who find 
it difficult to control their natural impulse to look at women. 

A variant of this myth about the Yetzer ha-Ra is found in B. Kiddushin 81a. Here 
Rabbi Amram was exposed to a strong sexual temptation, which he resisted. Then he 
forced the Evil Inclination out of his body, and it shot out of his body in a flame.

597. THE FIERY SERPENTS 

The Israelites set out from Mount Hor by way of the Red Sea to skirt the land of Edom. 
But the people grew restive on the journey, and the people spoke against God and against 
Moses, "Why did you make us leave Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread 
and no water, and we have come to loathe this miserable food." The Lord sent fiery 
serpents against the people. They bit the people and many of the Israelites died. The 
people came to Moses and said, "We sinned by speaking against the Lord and against 
you. Intercede with the Lord to take away the serpents from us!" And Moses interceded 
for the people. Then the Lord said to Moses, "Make a fiery figure and mount it on a 
standard. And if anyone who is bitten looks at it, he shall recover." Moses made a copper 
serpent and mounted it on a standard; and when anyone was bitten by a serpent, he 
would look at the copper serpent and recover. 

Greatly frustrated with the constant complaints of the Israelites, God punishes them 
with "fiery serpents." Exactly what these serpents are is not explained, but their bite 
was often fatal, and the people begged Moses to protect them from them. Moses does so 
in a strange way — he sets up a copper serpent on a pole for the people to look at when 
they have been bitten. This seems to have every earmark of idol worship (cf. 2 Kings 
18:4), yet Moses sets up the copper serpent at God's direction. Numbers Rabbah 19:22 
suggests they were called fiery serpents because they burned the soul. 

According to the Midrash Rabbenu Bahya , the Torah commentary of Rabbi Bachya 
ben Asher on Numbers 21:6, the fiery serpents were offshoots of the primeval serpent 
in the Garden of Eden. He quotes B. Bava Batra 16a, which identifies the fiery serpents 
with the Yetzer ha-Ra , the evil inclination, stating that "the serpent, Satan, the yetzer ha- 
ra , and the Angel of Death are one and the same."

598. THE DESERT SHUR 

The children of Israel journeyed through the desert Shur, a wilderness full of serpents, 
lizards, and scorpions. So deadly are the serpents that dwell in this desert that if one of 
them merely glides over the shadow of a flying bird, the bird falls dead in that place. 

As terrible as was the desert wanderings of the Israelites, rabbinic myths make it even 
worse, presenting the desert Shur as the worst of the deserts the people crossed. It is 
supematurally bad, as illustrated by what happens when a reptile glides over the shadow 
of a bird. 

Sources: 

Exodus Rabbah 24-25. 


599. THE DEAD OF THE DESERT 

A mysterious Bedouin led the sage Rabbah bar Bar Hannah to the bodies of those who 
died during the forty years of wandering in the desert. When they reached them, they 



472 MYTHS OF EXILE 


found that all of them were lying on their backs and their bodies were intact. The knee of 
one of them was raised, and the Bedouin was able to pass under it, riding on a camel 
holding his spear upright. 

Rabbah cut off the blue thread from the comer of one of their prayer shawls. But as 
soon as he did, he found that he and the Bedouin were frozen in place. The Bedouin told 
him that if he had taken anything from them, to return it, for anyone who takes anything 
from them will not be able to move away. Rabbah put it back and they were able to move 
freely again. 

Here the wandering sage Rabbah bar Bar Hannah is led to the Dead of the Desert — 
those Israelites who died during the 40 years of wandering in the desert in the time of 
Moses. Rabbah finds they have been miraculously preserved, and that they are the 
size of giants, demonstrated when the Bedouin rides a camel under one of their up- 
raised knees. r 

These bodies lying in the desert are thus evidence of the truth of the Torah about the 
wandering of the Israelites in the desert. By implication, then, all of the Torah is true. 

Rabbi Samuel Eliezer Edels, known as the Maharsha, interpreted the giant size of 
the bodies to symbolize that they were spiritual giants. Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, 
on the other hand, views these figures as wicked people, receiving their life-force 
from the Sitra Ahra, the Other Side, the side of evil. He concludes that they died in the 
desert because they did not tie themselves wholly to Moses. 

Rabbah cuts off the blue corner thread of the prayer shawl (tallit) of one of the dead 
of the desert because it has been dyed with the tekhelet dye, which is required by one 
of the 613 commandments ( mitzvot ) of the Torah, as stated in Numbers 15:38-39: Speak 
to the Israelite people and instruct them to make themselves fringes on the corners of their 
garments throughout the ages; let them attach a cord of blue to the fringe at each corner . That 
shall be your fringe; look at it and recall all the commandments ofYahweh and observe them. 

But Rabbah finds himself unable to move after this attempted theft, and he is not 
released until he returns what he has taken. 

Rabbah is so desperate to preserve this relic of the time of Moses because even in 
the time of Rabbah, around the end of the third century, no one knew how to produce 
this dye, nor exactly what color tekhelet was. For this reason the ancient rabbis decided 
not to dye the thread of the tallit that was supposed to be the color of tekhelet, but to 
leave it white. With a few exceptions of groups that claim to have discovered the 
secret of how to make tekhelet , the thread has been left white till this day. The reason- 
ing is that rather than fulfill one of the commandments of the Torah incorrectly it is 
better not to fulfill it at all. 

Numbers Rabbah 14:3 explains that God required the use of tekhelet because the blue 
of tekhelet resembles the sea, the sea resembles the sky, the sky resembles a rainbow, a 
rainbow resembles a cloud, a cloud resembles the heavenly throne, and the throne 
resembles the divine glory.

ment of Korah," p. 235, and "Where Heaven and Earth Meet," p. 194.

600. THE EXILE OF ISRAEL 

From the first, God intended that there would be many exiles for the people of Israel, for 
reasons known only to Him. 

Some say that the reason for all the exiles was to release the holy sparks. The Egyptian 
exile was the root of all exiles, and a multitude of holy sparks awaited redemption. Ever 
since, the people of Israel have sifted the holy sparks from the four corners of the earth. 



THE TEN LOST TRIBES 473 


Yet some say that that it was for Israel's good that God destroyed the Temple and 
drove the Jews into exile, for God will surely have mercy forever more and will rebuild 
the Temple with greater strength. Thus the exile is only an illusion, for God, to whom all 
mysteries are revealed, knows it is good for Israel. Everything that has happened during 
the long years of exile was in preparation for the redemption, and at the time of the 
liberation this will all be revealed. 

In God's scheme of things, everything has a purpose, even the many exiles to which 
the Jewish people have been subject. Here two important Hasidic rabbis, Elimelekh of 
Lizhensk and Levi Yitzhak of Berditchev, propose that the purpose of the exile was to 
prepare the people for redemption, and that God's plan would eventually be revealed. 

This myth acknowledges the confusion that often attended the setbacks and tragedies 
experienced by the chosen people, which were a great test of their faith. These two 
rabbis remind the people that God's true intentions are hard to discern, and that they 
must retain their faith through difficult trials, because these are merely preparation 
for the rewards to come in the messianic era. 

Note the primary role of the myth of the Ari of the Shattering of the Vessels and the 
Gathering of the Sparks in this myth. The Ari's myth turns the negative aspects of 
exile into positive one, making it possible for the Jewish people to travel far and wide 
gathering the holy sparks that were scattered everywhere. See "The Shattering of the 
Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks," p. 122.

601. THE SECRET OF THE EGYPTIAN EXILE 

The Egyptian exile contains a great secret: God chose the seed of Abraham and placed 
them in exile in order to make it possible for them to receive the Torah. Had God in- 
creased them and made them prosperous without exile, and had they taken possession 
of the land without receiving the Torah, how could He have compelled them to go the 
desert to receive it? Thus the purpose of the Egyptian exile was to enable Israel to receive 
the Torah, and it is the cause of the great reward God has bestowed upon His people. 

This myth is an attempt to justify the difficult trials of the people of Israel during 
their Egyptian bondage. Here the years of slavery are viewed as a preparation for the 
receiving of the Torah, which, in Gikatilla's view, could not have taken place without 
the suffering that preceded it. Since the Torah was the greatest gift that God gave to 
the Jewish people, the years of Egyptian bondage must be viewed as a necessary step 
in order to be worthy of receiving it.

602. THE TEN LOST TRIBES 

The Ten Lost Tribes were carried away as prisoners out of their own land, and they were 
sent into exile on the other side of the river Sambatyon, which can only be crossed on the 
Sabbath. But to cross it on that day would break the Sabbath, something the tribes would 
never do. There they are hidden from all other peoples. Some say they are covered by a 
cloud, which keeps them hidden, while others say it is the river itself that keeps them 



474 MYTHS OF EXILE 


isolated, as well as the mountains of darkness. Thus they have been separated from their 
fellow Jews for centuries, without any communication between them. 

, How did the Ten Lost Tribes reach the other side of the Sambatyon? It is said that when 
B'nei Moshe, the Sons of Moses, were exiled to Babylon, they were told to play their harps 
for their conquerors. They refused, and a cloud settled about them, raised them with their 
families and all their belongings, and carried them off, setting them down during the night. 
In the morning they discovered that impassable river that surrounded them. 

Now the Jews who lived on the other side of the river Sambatyon were exceptional in 
every way. All of them observed the Law with joy, and the level of wisdom of the average 
man was equal to that of the wisest sages among the Jews elsewhere. When the tribe of 
Issachar is hard pressed, for example, they ask counsel from heaven and this is how they 
are answered: The Prince of Issachar envelops himself in his prayer shawl and prays in a 
comer of the synagogue. The answer comes by fire from heaven descending upon the 
Prince of Issachar. This is seen by everyone, but the answer is heard by him alone. 

As for the sages among the Jews of the Ten Lost Tribes, they were masters of kabbalah, 
familiar with the most obscure mysteries of the Torah, and there were ten who knew the 
pronounciation of God's secret Name, YHVH, the Tetragrammaton, while among the 
rest of the Jews there was never more than one such sage in each generation. 

Some say that the exiles were divided into three. One-third was banished to the other 
side of the Sambatyon, one third was banished to the region further beyond the Sambatyon, 
and one-third was banished to Daphne near Riblah, where it was swallowed up. 

When the time of redemption has arrived, the Messiah will seek out the lost tribes 
who were banished to the other side of the Sambatyon, and tell them to go forth. Some 
say that at that time the wild waters of the River Sambatyon will subside, and a pathway 
of sand will lie before them, as it did for the Israelites who crossed the Red Sea. Then the 
people will be able to cross over, and the Messiah will lead them to the Holy Land. 

As for those swallowed up in Riblah, God will make underground passageways for 
them, and they will make their way underground through them, until they arrive at the 
Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. 

Then God Himself will stand upon the mount, as it is said. On that day, He will set His 
feet on the Mount of Olives (Zech. 14:4). At that time God will see that the mount is split 
open, and the exiles will come out of it to be reunited with their long lost brethren, and to 
celebrate the arrival of the End of Days. 

Nor will these three companies of exiles come alone. Wherever Jews are to be found, 
they will be gathered up and come to the holy city of Jerusalem. God will lower the 
mountains and make them into roads for them. So, too, will God raise up every deep 
place for them and make all the land level, so that their journey can be as easy as possible. 

When all the exiles have arrived and been gathered together, God will call upon heaven 
and earth to rejoice with them, and the whole world will join in the celebration. 

There are dozens of legends about the fate of the Ten Lost Tribes, and they are iden- 
tified with a great many communities, including the American Indians (partly because 
the Lost Tribes were sometimes described as red in the legends), the Japanese, and other 
unlikely peoples. Ethiopian Jews identify themselves as members of the lost tribe of 
Dan. Among those travelers who claimed to have discovered the Ten Lost Tribes is 
Eldad ha-Daru, who claimed to belong to the tribe of Dan, and asserted that he had 
found four of the lost tribes. According to him, the members of these tribes spoke only 
Hebrew. So too was their Talmud written in Hebrew, instead of Aramaic. Nor, because 
of their isolation, were any of these tribes able to communicate with the others. 

The myth of the Ten Lost Tribes is vividly portrayed in an elaborate tale of the 
rescue of a Jewish community by an emissary from the Ten Lost Tribes on the other 
side of the river Sambatyon. The tale exists in many variants, ranging from a page or 



THE TEN LOST TRIBES 475 


two to novella length. The longest and most complete version is that published in 
Yiddish by Yitzhak Rivkind. The hero in this tale is usually identified as Rabbi Meir 
Ba al ha-Nes, although this attribution is purely legendary. The tale is closely associ- 
ated with the Akdamut Millin, an Aramaic poem composed by Rabbi Meir ben Yitzhak 
Nehorai, which is recited in the synagogue on Shavuot. The origin of the poem is 
connected to the legend recounted in this tale. The Black Monk is a legendary figure 
who combines all of the elements of the anti-Semitic hostility that so plagued the Jews 
of Eastern Europe. His defeat at the hands of the old man from the other side of the 
river Sambatyon is similar to the tales told about Rabbi Adam, Rabbi Judah Loew, and 
the Ba'al Shem Tov, among others, who vanquished dangerous enemies of the Jews 
using supernatural powers based on kabbalistic incantations and holy names; i.e., 
powers deriving from God. The fact that the Jews in this tale had to turn to their 
brethren on the other side of the river Sambatyon indicates the desperation felt by 
Eastern European Jews in the face of the persecution they suffered, and their inability 
to find any other solution to the problem. At the same time, the tale is a reaffirmation 
of faith in God, and it is this aspect of it that is recalled in conjunction with the song 
of Akdamut. In fact, this story is generally known as Ma'aseh Akdamut , the tale of 
Akdamut. This story exists in many variants. See “The Black Monk and the Master of 
the Name" in Miriam's Tambourine , pp. 335-348. 

An unusual myth about the Ten Lost Tribes, likely of Christian origin, concerns 
Alexander's gate. Alexander the Great is said to have confined the lost tribes within a 
range of mountains by building an enormous gate. In some versions all of the Ten 
Lost Tribes are to be found there, while in others only the tribe of Issachar dwells 
beyond the mountains. The gate was said to be made of metal and was impenetrable, 
but Alexander made it appear even more invulnerable by using certain invisible de- 
vices for defending it. Brambles were planted and were so well watered that they 
overgrew the mountain. In addition, according to this myth, Alexander had men of 
iron constructed who wielded hammers and axes without interruption, making the 
wall resound under their blows, so that the people living enclosed within the moun- 
tains might believe that the work of building and fortifying was ever in progress, and 
that it would be utterly futile for them to attempt to burst forth. Alexander also mounted 
upon the rampart a stone eagle which, whenever it was approached, uttered a screech 
that could be heard an eight days' journey in every direction, and whenever the people 
heard it, they prayed to God to protect them from the impending menace. Finally, 
Alexander erected trumpets which resounded with the wind, giving the impression 
that his armies were guarding the exits from the Caucasus in full force. 

For a further discussion of the Ten Lost Tribes, see the Introduction, p. lx. See “The 
River Sambatyon," following.

603. THE RIVER SAMBATYON 

Ever since they went into exile beyond the river Sambatyon, the Ten Lost Tribes have 
been prevented from returning to their brothers in the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. It is 
the river itself that stops them. For six days its current is so strong that it throws up rocks 



476 MYTHS OF EXILE 


as high as a house, so that it sometimes gives the appearance of being a mountain in 
motion. But on Friday at sunset a cloud envelops the river, so that no man can cross it, 
and at the same time the waters come completely to a halt. Then on the Sabbath the 
waters subside and disappear, and it resembles a lake of snow-white sand, and at the 
close of the Sabbath it resumes its torrent of rushing water, stones, and sand. The Sabbath 
is the only day its wild current stops flowing. 

Where did the river Sambatyon come from? Some say it flowed from Paradise. Others 
insist that Sambatyon is another name for the Euphrates. On one side of the river there are 
the rich fields and forests of the land that was once Assyria, and on the other side dwell the 
descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, who were sent into exile by the Assyrian king 
Shalmaneser in 722 bce. Most accounts concur that the river came into being at the time of 
this exile, but the reason for its creation has long been a matter of debate. 

There are those who insist that the river was formed to remind the lost tribes of the 
unchanging nature of the eternal laws, and to assure them that they had not been forgot- 
ten in their exile. Then there are those who have concluded that the river was created to 
keep them in exile, since the Sabbath is also their day of rest and they cannot cross on that 
day any more than they could on any other day of the week. 

And when will the waters stop running? Not until the days of the Messiah will the 
people be permitted to cross. 

The legend of the river Sambatyon is first noted by Josephus (Wars, 7:5:1, although 
he reverses it, describing the river as running only on the Sabbath). All other versions 
of the legend describe it as running six days a week and resting on the Sabbath. This is 
how the story goes in the Talmud (B. San. 65b) and in the Midrash (Gen. Rab. 11:5 and 
73:6). Just as the children of Israel must rest on the Sabbath, so must the river. In this 
way the legend of the river Sambatyon serves to prove the holiness of the Sabbath and 
provides an explanation for the Ten Lost Tribes remaining in exile. See "The Ten Lost 
Tribes," p. 473.

604. THE CITY OF LUZ 

The natives of the city of Luz are spared the dangers that confront all other human be- 
ings. The histories of the city, reaching back for centuries, are filled with every detail of 
learning and life. Yet these same histories, though complete, do not record a single war, a 
single flood or fire, nor the death of a single person. For so safe are the citizens while they 
live inside the city, even the Angel of Death can do them no harm. 

Some say Luz is so safe because it was built on the spot where Jacob had the dream of 
the ladder reaching from earth into heaven, with angels ascending and descending on it. 
Others say that the Holy One set aside Luz after the Fall of Adam and Eve, to preserve 
one boundary in this world that the Angel of Death could not cross. In any case, not even 
the armies of Nebuchadnezzar could disturb the city. Nor do the people suffer from in- 
ternal strife. For all who are bom inside the city have their names inscribed in the Book of 
Life. 

The Torah commands that the precious dye known as tekhelet be used in dyeing a 
thread of the fringes of the tallit (prayer shawl) (Num. 15:38). But no one knew how the 
dye was made, or whether it was derived from a snail or shellfish. This dye was said to

be available in the city of Luz, but no one knew how to get there. King David is said to 
make his home there, thereby avoiding death for all time. That is why Jews sing a famous 
song with words that mean "King David is alive" ( David melekh Yisrael hai ve-kayyam). 
After learning that Jews sang such a song about King David, the Turkish sultan accused 
them of obeying King David instead of him. He demanded a gift from King David, one 
that only King David could give him. Messengers were sent on a quest to the city of Luz. 
They reached it through one of the caves that lead directly to the Holy Land, discovered 
the secret entrance, and found King David in the city, who rewarded them with an apple 
from the Tree of Life. This apple later saved the sultan's daughter from a sleeping sick- 
ness, and the Jews of the community were suitably rewarded. 

The walls that surrounded the city of Luz had no apparent entrance, since the city 
would otherwise have been deluged by those seeking eternal life. But there was an al- 
mond (luz) tree that stood before the gates, from which the city is said to have taken its 
name, with a hollow trunk, which led to a secret cave that passed beneath the walls and 
emerged inside the city. It was this exit that the inhabitants of Luz had to take if they 
chose to depart from the city. 

Yet despite their safety and the great blessing of immortality, there was one mystery 
that absorbed the wise men at night, and one source of sadness that caused the families 
to suffer from time to time. For in the course of a life it always happened that very old 
people would take leave of their families and walk off alone, to make their way into the 
world outside the walls of the city. 

Why would anyone, young or old, choose to abandon such a city? And why did these 
wanderers never come back? Some are believed to have grown tired of living, others to 
have been called by an angel to another place. But when they passed through the hollow 
trunk and reentered the mortal world, they are said to have found the Angel of Death 
waiting there to take their lives and bury them in the fields beyond the walls. 

The earliest reference to the city of Luz appears in Genesis 28:19: And he called the 
name of that place Beth El, but the name of the city was Luz at first. Thus Luz is identified 
with the place where Jacob had his famous dream of the ladder with angels ascending 
and descending. What was so special about this place? The myth grew up that it was 
the location of a city of immortals, and all who entered there were spared the Angel of 
Death. 

The commandment for the use of the blue dye (tekhelet) derives from Numbers 
15:38. 

This legend of a city of immortals is unique in Jewish literature, although the no- 
tion of a boundary that the Angel of Death cannot cross appears in the Zohar (4:151a), 
referring to the Land of Israel as a whole rather than to the city of Luz: "It is the 
Destroying Angel who brings death to all people, except those who die in the Holy 
Land, to whom death comes by the Angel of Mercy, who holds sway there." The vari- 
ous strata of legend concerning the city of Luz can all be found in this tale, which 
offers an opportunity to study the legendary evolution of a text. It is possible to ob- 
serve the expansion of the myth of Luz in the Talmud, B. Sota 46b, and further embel- 
lishment is found in Genesis Rabbah 69:8. In such a case, each given detail becomes 
exceptionally significant. Since the literal meaning of luz is an almond tree, the motif 
of the tree is drawn upon, and it is said to have been placed at the entrance of the city. 

Then the development is taken a step further, embellishing the role of the tree: "This 
tree was hollow, and through it one entered the cave and through the cave the city" 
(Genesis Rabbah 69:8). 

The origin of the immortal nature of the city of Luz is also linked to the bone at the 
bottom of the spine known as the luz bone, which survives longer than any other part 
of the body. 



478 MYTHS OF EXILE 


The legend of the city of Luz is the source of the legend of Shangri-La found in 
James Hilton's novel Lost Horizon . Those who left Shangri-La immediately turned old 
and gray just as those who departed from the city of Luz immediately encountered 
the Angel of Death. For another tale about the city of Luz, see the following story, "An 
Appointment with Death."

B. Sota 46b; Genesis Rabbah 69:8; Dos Buck fun Nisyoynes. 


605. AN APPOINTMENT WITH DEATH 

One morning, as King Solomon awoke, he heard a chirping outside his window. He sat 
up in bed and listened carefully, for he knew the language of the birds, and he overheard 
them say that the Angel of Death had been sent to take the lives of two of his closest 
advisers. King Solomon was startled by this unexpected news, and he summoned the 
two doomed men. And when they stood before him, he revealed what he had learned of 
their fate. 

The two were terrified, and they begged King Solomon to help them. Solomon told 
them that their only hope was to find their way to the city of Luz. For it was well known 
that the Angel of Death was forbidden to enter there. Therefore the inhabitants of Luz 
were immortal — as long as they remained within the walls of the charmed city. Very few 
knew the secret of how to reach that city, but King Solomon was one of those few. 

So it was that King Solomon revealed the secret to the two frightened men, and they 
departed at once. They whipped their camels across the hot desert all day, and at night- 
fall they saw finally the walls of that fabled city. Immortality was almost within reach 
and they rode as fast as they could to the city gates. 

But when they arrived they saw, to their horror, the Angel of Death waiting for them. 
"How did you know to look for us here?" they asked. The angel replied: "This is where I 
was told to meet you." 

This myth derives from the reference in Genesis 28:19 to Luz as the original name 
of the place where Jacob had his dream of the heavenly ladder. The Talmud (B. Sot. 

53a) identifies the city of Luz as a city of immortals. Since the Angel of Death was not 
permitted to enter, the old people who had grown tired of life had to leave the city, 
where the angel was waiting for them. The location of the city of Luz was regarded as 
a well-kept secret, since it would otherwise be deluged by those seeking immortality, 
but such secret knowledge was easily accessible to King Solomon. See "The City of 
Luz," p. 476. 

The primary moral of this tale is that it is impossible to escape that which has been 
fated. It is one of several tales concerning King Solomon in which he tries to outfox 
fate and fails. See "The Princess in the Tower" in Elijah's Violin , pp. 47-52. See also 
"The City of Luz" in Elijah's Violin , pp. 279-293, which recounts many of the traditions 
associated with this city of immortals. 

Many cultures have a myth about a city of immortals, and it is a theme that ap- 
pears in many works of fiction, including John O'Hara's Appointment in Samarra and 
James Hilton's Lost Horizon. The version in the Talmud appears to be the earliest form 
of the myth.

THE TEN LOST TRIBES 479 


606. THE WORLD OF TEVEL 

There are six worlds beneath the earth. The best known of them is called Tevel. The sun 
in Tevel rises in the west and sets in the east. There are 365 kinds of creatures who inhabit 
Tevel, all of them different from those who live on this side of the earth. Some of them 
have the head of a lion and the body of a man; others have the head of a man and the 
body of a lion. Some have the head of a snake and the body of a man; others the head of 
a man and the body of a snake. So too are there beings with human heads and bodies of 
oxen, who speak like humans. Strangest of all the creatures in Tevel, however, are those 
who have two heads and four arms and four legs, but only one trunk and one stomach. 
When they sit at the table, they seem like two people, but when they stand up and walk 
around, they are like one. 

These creatures of Tevel are rarely peaceful. They quarrel among themselves over ev- 
ery little thing. Sometimes one head says, "Let's go in this direction!" and the other an- 
swers, "No! Let's go the other way!" Since they only have one body, they take one step 
forward and one step back — and they end up in exactly the same place where they had 
started. Neither head wants to give in to the other, and so they stand around all day 
quarreling, until it is time for the next meal. 

Then, since both heads are hungry, they agree that it is time to make something to eat. 
But when it comes to cooking the food, they can never decide on what to make. One head 
says, "I want something hot!" and the other, "I want something cold!" They do manage 
to solve this problem by cooking for both heads. First they prepare the cold dish, and 
then they prepare the hot one, so that the hot meal doesn't get cold while the other is 
being made. Finally they sit down to eat. Then, for just a little while, there is peace. But as 
soon as the meal is finished, the heads start arguing again. "You ate more than I did!" 
cries the first head. "No, you ate more!" cries the second, accusing the first of the very 
same thing. 

In his encounter with King Solomon, Ashmedai, King of Demons, put his hand in the 
earth and brought forth from Tevel a man with two heads and four eyes. This creature 
married a human wife and had six sons that resembled her and the seventh who looked 
like him. The one with two heads wanted two portions of his inheritance and they went 
to King Solomon to decide the matter. Solomon scalded one head and both cried out in 
pain. Then Solomon observed that they must be the same person, since they both experi- 
enced the pain. 

Just as there are seven heavens, so there are seven earths, of which the one with 
which we are familiar is only the top level. Each subsequent level is a world in itself 
under the earth, and one of these underground worlds is Tevel, with strange inhabit- 
ants, such as those with two heads, as described here.

607, THE MANNA 

While crossing the wilderness of Sinai, the children of Israel began to grow weary in their 
wandering, for no food was to be found. Then one morning a north wind swept the 
surface of the desert, rain washed the ground and cleansed it, and bread rained down 
from the sky, as it is said. He gave them bread from heaven (Ps. 105:40). The people went out 
to gather it, and enjoyed it while it was still warm. There was no need to cook or bake it. 
They called it manna, as it is said. And He rained manna upon them for food (Ps. 78:24). God 



480 MYTHS OF EXILE 


had sent it from heaven, where loaves of delicate white bread are said to be abundant. 
Some say that letters of the Torah descended together with the manna, and the Israelites 
collected these words as well. Others say that the Torah was only given to those who ate 
the manna, for only they were worthy of it. 

Every day enough manna fell to sustain the Jewish people for two thousand years, so 
that the Israelites had no need of carrying it in their wanderings. They gathered the manna 
every day, for it only lasted one day before it melted into many streams that went through 
the wilderness and passed into the lands of many nations. No one gathered more than he 
or she needed. Those who gathered much had no excess, and those who gathered little 
had no lack. But on Friday they collected enough for two days, and that manna lasted till 
the end of the Sabbath. In this way the Sabbath was blessed and sanctified with the manna. 

The manna was one of the ten things created on the sixth day, on the eve of the first 
Sabbath. It was a very ethereal food, the food of the angels, as it is said. Humans did eat 
angel's food (Psalms 78:25). Some say it was ground in heaven by the angels, as a bread for 
the angels to eat. Others say that it is prepared by the angels for the souls of the righteous in 
the World to Come. Thus it was the angels who ground the manna for the people of Israel 
and prepared it to send down to them. Some say that it had the taste of milk and honey, 
while others say it had the taste as well as the fragrance of whatever the one who ate it most 
desired. For all the different tastes of the foods in the world, and all their various appear- 
ances, as well as all the pleasant fragrances, were included in the manna, which didn't 
require baking or cooking. The young men would eat it as if it were bread, the old men as 
if it were a wafer covered with honey, and the infants as if it were milk from their mothers' 
breasts. But to the other nations of the world it would taste as bitter as coriander. 

Normally, wheat ascends from below and water descends from above. But God did 
not follow that procedure with the manna. He sent wheat from above, as it is said, I will 
rain down bread for you from the sky (Exod. 16:4), while God caused water to ascend from 
below, as it is said. Spring up, O well, sing to it (Num. 21:17). For all forty years of their 
wandering, the manna came down, until the people reached the Promised Land. 

In B. Yoma 75b, Rabbi Akiba states that the manna was the food of the angels. How- 
ever, Rabbi Ishmael contradicts him, saying, "Do angels eat?" And he quotes Exodus 
34:28: And he was there with Yahweh forty days and nights; neither did he eat bread or drink 
water. 

According to Rashi, commenting on Psalms 78:25, the manna was a spiritual food 
that produced no waste products. According to Ben Ish Hai in Derushim, the manna 
was given to them so that they would become wise in Torah. 

The Hasidic Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Riminov, suggested that the manna 
had a spiritual as well as a material benefit. Since bread ( lehem ), in his view, represents 
the Torah, the falling of the manna represented new insights into the Torah that are 
constantly being revealed. Another Rebbe, Simcha Bunam of Parsischa, suggested that 
manna still comes down, meaning that God still makes His abundant blessings avail- 
able to us.

BOOK TEN 


MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 



On New Moons and holy days and Sabbaths, the Messiah enters those halls of 
longing, lifts up his voice, and weeps. Then the Garden of Eden trembles and the 
firmament shakes until his voice ascends all the way to God's throne. And when 
God hears his voice, God beckons the enchanted bird, and it flies from the Garden 
of Eden and enters its nest and begins to sing. 


Zohar 2:8a-9a 






THE CREATION OF THE MESSIAH 


608. THE CREATION OF THE MESSIAH 

Some say that even before the world was created. King Messiah had already come into 
being, for he existed in God's thought even before the creation of the sun and the moon 
and the stars, as it is said. His name bursts forth before the sun (Ps. 72:17). At the time of the 
Messiah's creation, God told him in detail of the suffering that would befall him in the 
future, for he would be bent down by the sins of souls as yet unborn, which were kept 
beneath God's throne. God asked him if he was willing to endure such things. 

The Messiah asked God, "Will my suffering last many years?" 

God replied, "I have decreed it will last for seven years." 

The Messiah answered, "Master of the Universe, I take this suffering upon myself as 
long as not one person in Israel shall perish. And if not only those who are alive will be 
saved in my days, but also those who have died from the days of Adam until the time of 
the Redemption. These things I am ready to take upon myself." 

God replied, "Not one breathing creature of your generation shall I cause to perish. So 
too will the dead among the righteous rise from their graves to greet you." Then God 
appointed the four creatures who would carry the Messiah's Throne of Glory at the End 
of Days. Thus was the covenant completed between God and the Messiah. 

Others say that the Messiah is subjected to suffering in every generation, according to 
the sins of that generation. About this God said, "In the hour of the Redemption, I shall 
create the Messiah anew and he will no longer suffer." 

Jewish tradition holds that the coining of the Messiah was always part of God's 
plan. This is emphasized here by asserting that the Messiah was brought into being 
before the creation of the world. The proof of the Messiah's pre-existence is said to be 
found in the verse, And the spirit of God moved (Gen. 1:2), words that are linked to the 
Messiah, of whom it is said. The spirit ofYahweh shall alight upon him (Isa. 11:2). Indeed, 
the Messiah is included in the lists of things that were created before the rest of cre- 
ation, where it is said that the Messiah's name was engraved on a precious stone on 
the altar of the heavenly Temple. See "Seven Things Created before the Creation of the 
World," p. 74. 

This myth describes a strange covenant of suffering between God and the heav- 
enly Messiah. The Messiah agrees to take on terrible suffering for seven years as a 
sacrifice for the people of Israel. This has a distinct echo of the Christian belief that 
Jesus suffered for human sins. But more than that, it mirrors the suffering the Jewish 
people were undergoing, and their hope that somehow they would be credited for all 
that suffering and be rewarded by God in the future. This suffering and these hopes 
are then projected onto the heavenly Messiah in this myth. 

The covenant has two parts, the suffering of the Messiah and the reward for all that 
suffering. In making this covenant, God appoints four creatures to carry the Messiah's 
throne, thus clearly indicating God's certainty that the Messiah will survive his time 
of suffering and receive the promised reward. That the Messiah is destined to sit on a 
throne makes this an enthronement myth about the Messiah. For another such myth, 
see "The Enthronement of the Messiah," p. 487. 

Note that this myth not only mentions the creation of the Messiah, but also the re- 
creation of the Messiah. This remarkable re-creation, it is said, will take place at the 
time of the Messianic era. It may refer to the existence of myths about multiple Messi- 
ahs, especially the tradition of Messiah ben Joseph, the suffering human Messiah, and 
Messiah ben David, the celestial Messiah, where the former prepares the way for the 
latter. Here "re-creation" may be viewed as a way of establishing a direct link between 
these two Messiahs, one having been re-created out of the other. See "The Two Messi- 
ahs," p. 517.

484 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 


Note that God creates a chariot for the Messiah not unlike God's own Chariot, the 
Merkavah in the vision of Ezekiel. This strongly implies that the Messiah is a divine 
figure of the utmost importance and power, not unlike the angel Metatron, who is 
sometimes identified as the "Lesser Yahweh."

Scholem. 


609. THE BIRTH OF THE MESSIAH 

The Messiah emerged in the thought of God even before the world was created, and the 
Messiah was bom at the beginning of the creation of the world. His name was one of the 
seven things created before the sun was created, before the stars of heaven were made. 
Indeed, he was the firstborn of God. Some say that his name is Menahem, others that it is 
David. 

At that time God appointed four animals to carry the throne of the Messiah. And 
while the sons of Jacob were busy with the selling of Joseph, while Jacob was busy mourn- 
ing over Joseph, while Judah was busy taking a wife, God was creating the light of the 
Messiah, which will be revealed at the End of Days. 

These myths point to a heavenly Messiah, while others refer to an earthly one. 

There are various names attributed to the Messiah, including Menahem and David. 
Midrash Mishlei (p. 87) gives seven names for the Messiah: Yinnon, Tzidkenu, Tzemah, 
Menahem, David, Shiloh, and Elijah. These seven names are associated with the verse 
We will set up over it seven shepherds (Micah 5:4). Two primary messianic figures evolved 
in Jewish myth, Messiah ben David and Messiah ben Joseph. The former was said to 
be descended from David, the latter from Joseph. Messiah ben Joseph was generally 
understood as a forerunner Messiah who would prepare the way for Messiah ben 
David. 

There is another tradition that on the day the Temple was destroyed, the Messiah 
was bom. It is found in Lamentations Rabbah 1:51.

B. Sanhedrin 98b-99a; Y. Berakhot 5a; Genesis Rabbah 85:1; Lamentations Rabbah 1:51. 


610. THE SCALES OF THE MESSIAH 

The Messiah was created when the Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed. At that time God 
commanded Elijah the Prophet to bring scales to him. On one side of the scales Elijah 
would place the captive Messiah, along with the souls of the dead, and Elijah would fill 
the other scales with tears, torture, and the souls of the Tzaddikim. And when this had 
been done, God announced that the face of the Messiah would be seen when the scales 
were balanced. 


This orally collected myth portrays the conditions that would enable the coming of 
the Messiah — a balancing of heavenly scales with the Messiah on one side with the 



THE CREATION OF THE MESSIAH 485 


souls of the dead, and the suffering of Israel with the souls of the Tzaddikim on the 
other. The idea is that God is well aware of the suffering of Israel, and when the time 
is right. He will send the Messiah to ease that suffering. This suggests a kind of heav- 
enly mechanism to trigger the messianic era and the End of Days. 

Sources: 

IFA6929. 


611. THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE MESSIAH 

King Messiah will arise and restore the kingdom of David to its former glory. He will 
rebuild the Temple and gather all the exiles of Israel. All ancient laws will be reinstituted 
in his days; sacrifices will again be offered; the Sabbatical and Jubilee years will again be 
observed according to the commandments set forth in the Law. 

This statement by Maimonides is quite definitive, except that it does not include 
the resurrection of the dead, the last of Maimonides' own Thirteen Principles. Indeed, 
in Mishneh Torah , Hilkhot Melakhim 11:3, Maimonides denies that the Messiah will bring 
the dead to life: "Do not think that King Messiah will have to perform signs and 
wonders, bring anything new into being, revive the dead, or do similar things." 

The two other major requirements of the Messiah are listed here by Maimonides: 
the rebuilding of the Temple and the Ingathering of the Exiles. Thus Maimonides 
downplays the supernatural elements in the messianic tradition, viewing the messi- 
anic era in practical terms that could be accomplished without overthrowing the laws 
of nature. Indeed, in 12:1, he states this explicitly: "Let no one think that in the days of 
the Messiah any of the laws of nature will be set aside, or any innovation be intro- 
duced into creation. The world will follow its normal course."

612. THE SOUL OF THE MESSIAH 

Like Adam's soul, the soul of the Messiah is comprised of all other souls. Indeed, the soul 
of the Messiah contains the souls of all generations. For one who encompasses all genera- 
tions in his soul possesses the powers of the entire world. And when he repents, he can 
arouse repentance in everyone. 

Some say that the soul of the Messiah has been exiled to a place of desert and desola- 
tion where no one walks. A storm wind rose up and created such confusion that the 
Messiah lost all the signs that were given to him, with which he was to identify himself 
before the people of Israel. As a result, it became impossible to recognize him, for he had 
no way of revealing himself. Furthermore, some of the lost signs and marvels of the 
Messiah were found by false prophets who began to appear, calling themselves by the 
name Messiah. But once their lies and wantonness were exposed, their false teachings 
were revealed for all the world to see. 

Others say that the soul of the Messiah has been chained and is being held captive by 
the forces of evil. Not until the chains of the Messiah are broken will the captive soul of 
the Messiah be set free. 



486 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 


Still others believe that after the Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the 
Sparks, the soul of the Messiah, which was sunk among the broken vessels, sent forth 
sparks in every generation. If a generation is worthy, that spark might become the Mes- 
siah, and the footsteps of the Messiah would be heard throughout the world. 

The soul of the Messiah is described in terms that make it all-inclusive. Like the 
traditions about Adam's soul, the Messiah's soul is said to contain all souls, even all 
generations of souls. See "Adam's Soul," p. 162. 

There are various myths portraying the Messiah's soul as being exiled or impris- 
oned. One such myth describes it as being held captive in chains. Others describe the 
soul as being lost in a desert. From the time of Moses there was the tradition that the 
Redeemer could be identified by a sign. In the case of Moses, the words were I have 
taken note of you (Exod. 3:16). In die Midrash, Serah bat Asher, who lived from the time 
of Jacob until the time of Moses, is said to have identified Moses as the Redeemer. 
Likewise, there are certain signs that are said to accompany the Messiah, and here 
even these signs are said to have become lost, suggesting a time so chaotic that even if 
the Messiah appeared, no one would recognize him. 

These accounts of exile and imprisonment are meant to explain why the Messiah 
has not yet come. As long as the Messiah's soul is being held captive, it cannot de- 
scend into the body of the Messiah, and therefore prevents the birth and coming of the 
Messiah. 

One of the myths about the Messiah's soul derives from a Shabbatean source, the 
writings of Nathan of Gaza, primary apostle of Shabbatai Zevi, the false Messiah of 
the seventeenth century. This is a kabbalistic myth, based on the Ari's myth of the 
Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks. For more on the myth of the 
Ari see p. 122. In this Shabbatean myth, a spark of the Messiah's soul descends in each 
generation, and if the generation is worthy, the spark will become the Messiah. This 
places the onus for the coming of the Messiah on the piety of each generation, and 
means that the coming of the Messiah will not take place until there is a worthy gen- 
eration. See "The Chains of the Messiah," p. 492 and "The Captive Messiah," p. 498.

613. THE DESCENT OF THE MESSIAH'S SOUL 

The soul of the Messiah lives in a palace in heaven. There is a potential Messiah bom on 
earth in every generation. That person, known as the Tzaddik ha-Dor, the most righteous 
of his generation, has both an earthly soul and a heavenly soul. If the time is right for the 
Messiah to come, then the heavenly soul will descend and fuse with the earthly soul, and 
the days of the Messiah will have arrived. 

In recent times some members of the Lubavitch Hasidim came to believe strongly 
that their Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, was the Messiah. In addition 
to a public campaign for "Messiah Now," Lubavitch theologians searched the existing 
messianic traditions for evidence that the Rebbe, as he was universally known, was 
the Messiah. Here they encountered two apparently contradictory traditions. One holds 
that the Messiah is a divine figure, who makes his home in a heavenly palace. The 
other tradition holds that the Messiah will be the Tzaddik ha-Dor , the greatest sage of 
his generation — a human being. These were originally two separate messianic tradi- 
tions in Judaism, but they were eventually linked. The earthly, human Messiah was 



THE HEAVENLY MESSIAH 487 


identified as Messiah ben Joseph, who was said to pave the way for the heavenly 
Messiah, known as Messiah ben David. However, this myth held that Messiah ben 
Joseph would lose his life in the process. Before the death of the Rebbe, Jacob Immanuel 
Schochet, a prominent Lubavitch scholar, often lectured on the subject of the Messiah. 
There was no doubt that his descriptions of the qualities of the Messiah were intended 
to refer to the Rebbe. In these lectures, Schochet presented a new messianic theory, 
combining the myths of Messiah ben Joseph and Messiah ben David into a single 
myth. Here, rather than having one Messiah prepare the way for the other, the figure 
of the Messiah was simultaneously human and divine. This was made possible by the 
descent of the soul of the heavenly Messiah into the body of the human one. Thus, in 
the Lubavitch view, the heavenly Messiah himself will not descend, but merely his 
soul, which will fuse with the soul of the human Messiah. This made it possible to 
explain how a human, such as the Rebbe, could fulfill the role of Messiah ben David, 
the heavenly Messiah.

614. THE ENTHRONEMENT OF THE MESSIAH 

In the future, God will dress the Messiah in garb whose splendor will radiate from one 
end of the world to the other, and place the Messiah at His right hand. And Abraham will 
be at His left. Abraham's face will turn pale, and he will say to God: "Is my son's son to sit 
at Your right and I at Your left?" And God will reply, "Your son's son is on your right, and 
I am on your right, as it is said, Yakweh at your right hand " (Ps. 110:5). 

What role will the Messiah play after he initiates the messianic era? In this myth, 
the Messiah comes to sit at the right hand of God. Thus the Messiah receives the kind 
of enthronement found in other myths about Adam, Enoch, Jacob, Moses, and King 
David. What is unusual is not only that Abraham sits at God's left hand, but that the 
arrival of the Messiah means that the figure who receives enthronement will be one of 
a trinity rather than a duality. This is surely significant and might indicate the influ- 
ence of the Christian concept of the Trinity.

615. THE MESSIAH WILL DESCEND FROM THE SIDE OF EVIL 

For reasons known only to Him, God caused events to occur whereby the Messiah will be 
bom from the realm of evil, for the Messiah will descend from the House of David. And 
King David was descended from Ruth the Moabite, and Moab was the son of one of the 
two daughters of Lot. After the destruction of Sodom, Lot, who was intoxicated, commit- 
ted incest with his daughters. Thus when God said, "J have found David " (Ps. 89:21), where 
did He find him? In Sodom. Thus the soul of the Messiah is descended from such a place. 

If the Messiah were to descend from a righteous person rather than the incestuous Lot, 
no enemy would have been able to prevail against Israel, or cause them to be forced into 
exile. God ordained things to happen this way, although no one knows why. David wanted 
to banish the evil side from which he had been bom, eliminating it from the world, but he 
was unable to do so, for he had no power over the side of evil, since he had been bom from it. 



488 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 

In the Zohar and later kabbalistic and Hasidic commentaries, the incestuous union 
of Lot and his daughters (Gen. 19:30-38) is identified as the source of the power of the 
Yetzer ha-Ra, the Evil Impulse. This leads to the mysterious conclusion that the Mes- 
siah will descend from the side of evil. The key concept here is that the Messiah's soul 
is closest to evil, possessing great intensity. But in the messianic era the evil soul will 
be transformed, by a process of tikkun — repair or restoration — into the good.

616. A WAR IN HEAVEN AND ON EARTH 

Near the time of redemption, a great and boundless war will break out in heaven, and 
there will be a corresponding war on earth. Eternal beings and mortal beings will battle 
one another. Destructive angels will attack the Jews, and seek to destroy and eradicate 
them. Evil will expand its dominion and strive to intensify the exile. It will be a time of 
great confusion, and some will be tempted to abandon their faith. But the people of Israel 
must persevere and hold fast to their faith. Only then will the time of redemption be 
fulfilled and there will be peace and tranquility, rest and calm. 

This is an apocalyptic vision describing a war in heaven as well as on earth. It is 
clearly intended to refer to the war of Gog and Magog, which, it is said, will precede 
the coming of the Messiah. However, while the war of Gog and Magog is usually 
described as an earthly conflict, this myth presents it as one that will take place above 
and below.

617. THE PALACE OF THE MESSIAH 

From the beginning the Messiah was hidden in a heavenly palace known as the Bird's 
Nest. That is a secret place containing a thousand halls of yearning, where none may 
enter except for the Messiah. It is there that the Messiah waits for the sign to be given that 
his time has come at last. 

The palace is known as the Bird's Nest because of the wonderful bird of the Messiah, 
which has its nest in a tree near his palace. 

On New Moons and holy days and Sabbaths, the Messiah enters those halls of long- 
ing, lifts up his voice, and weeps. Then the Garden of Eden trembles and the firmament 
shakes until his voice ascends all the way to God's throne. And when God hears his 
voice, God beckons the enchanted bird, and it flies from the Garden of Eden and enters 
its nest and begins to sing. 

Now the song of that bird is indescribably beautiful; no one has ever heard a music so 
sublime. Three times the bird repeats its song, and then the bird and the Messiah ascend 
on high, to the very Throne of Glory. There God swears to them that He will destroy the 
wicked kingdom of Rome and will give His children all the blessings that are destined 
for them. After that the bird returns to its nest and the Messiah returns to his palace, and 
once again he remains hidden there, waiting. 



THE HEAVENLY MESSIAH 489 


The longing and weeping of the Messiah are common images in Jewish lore. The 
Messiah weeps out of his own frustration, as well as out of his awareness of the frus- 
tration of the Jewish people that the messianic era still has not come. This mutual 
waiting is portrayed in a legend about Rabbi Joshua ben Levi, who is said to have had 
an encounter with the Messiah (Ma'aseh de-Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi in Beit ha-Midrash 
2:50). The Messiah said to him: "What is Israel doing in the world from which you 
came?" He replied, "They are waiting for you every day." As soon as he heard this, the 
Messiah lifted up his voice and cried. See "The Ladder of Prayers," p. 490.

618. A MESSIANIC PROPHECY 

In the sabbatical year. King Shabbatai, the Messiah, will return from the River Sambatyon 
mounted on a celestial lion. His bridle will be a seven-headed serpent, who breathes 
devouring fire. He will be accompanied by his predestined bride. All nations and kings 
shall bow low before him. On that day the Ingathering of the Exiles shall take place, and 
the heavenly Temple will descend from above, already built. So too will the resurrection 
of those who have died in the Holy Land take place, while those who died outside the 
Holy Land will be resurrected forty years later. 

This messianic prophecy derives from a letter sent by Nathan of Gaza, prophet of 
Shabbatai Zevi, in the fall of 1665. It contains his prophecy that Shabbatai Zevi would 
return as the long-awaited Messiah from the river Sambatyon to fulfill the three es- 
sential requirements of the Messiah: the Ingathering of the Exiles, in which all Jews in 
the world will be brought to the Holy Land; the resurrection of the righteous dead; 
and the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem. Here the Temple, already built, de- 
scends from heaven. Some messianic traditions assume the earthly Temple will be 
rebuilt, while others describe a Temple that will descend from on high. See "The De- 
scent of the Heavenly Temple," p. 512. 

Note that in Nathan of Gaza's prophecy, Shabbatai Zevi returns from the mythical 
river Sambatyon, which is said to run wildly six days a week, and only to rest on the 
Sabbath, trapping the Ten Lost Tribes on the other side, since they cannot cross on the 
that day. See "The River Sambatyon," p. 475. This reinforces the supernatural quali- 
ties of Shabbatai Zevi. In reality, Shabbatai Zevi abruptly converted to Islam in Sep- 
tember 1666, when the messianic excitement he had stirred up was at its height.

619. THE SUFFERING MESSIAH 

God decreed that the Messiah would suffer for seven years before the time of the Re- 
demption. During that time, iron beams will be brought and loaded upon his neck until 
his body is bent low. Then he will cry out, his voice rising to the highest heavens, saying 
to God, "How much can my spirit endure? How long before my breath ceases? How 
much more can my limbs suffer?" 



490 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 


God will reply, "My Messiah, long ago you took this ordeal upon yourself. At this 
moment, your pain is like My pain. You, like Me, suffer for the sake of Israel. This I swear 
to you — ever since My Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, I have not been able to bring 
myself to sit on My throne." 

At these words the Messiah will say, "Now I am reconciled. The servant is content to 
be like his Master." 

After that Elijah will comfort the Messiah in one of the halls of Paradise. He will hold 
the Messiah's hands against his chest and say, "Bear the suffering God has imposed upon 
you because of the sins of the Jewish people until the End of Days. Have courage — the 
end is near." And when he hears this, the Messiah will be comforted. 

The Messiah suffers pains over the sins of Israel, and here, in the seven years be- 
fore the initiation of the messianic era, God decrees great suffering for the Messiah, 
who accepts it as part of his burden. The theme of the suffering Messiah obviously 
recalls the passion of Jesus, and Jewish tradition may in this case have been influ- 
enced by Christian tradition. See "The Creation of the Messiah," p. 483.

620. THE LADDER OF PRAYERS 

The Ba'al Shem Tov was once praying with his Hasidim. That day he prayed with great 
concentration, not only word by word, but letter by letter, so that the others finished long 
before he did. At first they waited for him, but before long they lost patience, and one by 
one they left. 

Later the Ba'al Shem Tov came to them and said: "While I was praying, I ascended the 
ladder of your prayers all the way into Paradise. As I ascended, I heard a song of inde- 
scribable beauty. At last I reached the palace of the Messiah, in the highest heavens, known 
as the Bird's Nest. The Messiah was standing by his window, peering out at a tree of great 
beauty. I followed his gaze and saw that his eyes were fixed on a golden dove, whose nest 
was in the top branches of that tree. That is when I realized that the song pervading all of 
Paradise was coming from that golden dove. And I understood that the Messiah could 
not bear to be without that dove and its song for as much as a moment. Then it occurred 
to me that if I could capture the dove, and bring it back to this world, the Messiah would 
be sure to follow. 

"So I ascended higher, until I was within arm's reach of the golden dove. But just as I 
reached for it, the ladder of prayers collapsed." 

In this Hasidic tale, "The Ladder of Prayers," the Ba'al Shem Tov ascends into Para- 
dise on a quest to capture the golden dove of the Messiah, certain that this will cause 
the Messiah to follow, initiating the messianic era. The failure of the Ba'al Shem Tov's 
Hasidim to provide the support needed for this great endeavor, as symbolized by the 
collapse of die ladder of prayers, causes him to lose the opportunity to bring the Mes- 
siah. That makes this one more tale about why the Messiah has not come. Dozens of 
other such tales record lost opportunities to bring about the messianic era, or attempts 
to force the Messiah's hand, and hasten the End of Days. 



THE HEAVENLY MESSIAH 491 


This tale, and virtually the entire body of rabbinic, kabbalistic, folk, and Hasidic 
lore, exists in a mythological framework. The ladder of prayers the Ba'al Shem Tov 
ascends was surely inspired by the heavenly ladder in Jacob's dream. He climbs this 
ladder of prayers into Paradise, a mythological realm with its own order, its own 
geography, its own history, and its own inhabitants — not only God and the angels, 
but the Bride of God and the Messiah as well. It is understood that the Messiah is 
waiting for the sign to be given that the time has come for the messianic era. All the 
same, Jewish mysticism contains the secret of how to hasten the coming of the Mes- 
siah, secrets that the Ba'al Shem Tov has at his command. 

In addition, this tale draws on a rich tradition of tales about heavenly ascent, from 
the ascent of Elijah in a fiery chariot to the famous tale of the four who entered Para- 
dise. Indeed, "The Ladder of Prayers," a Hasidic tale of eighteenth century origin, is a 
direct descendant of the legend of the four sages, which dates from the second cen- 
tury. As did the four sages, the Ba'al Shem Tov ascends to heaven because he seeks 
greater knowledge of the divine realm. 

The Zohar tells of a dove that makes its nest outside the palace of the Messiah in 
Paradise. That is why the palace of the Messiah is also known as the "Bird's Nest." 
"The Ladder of Prayers" builds on the earlier legendary accounts of the golden dove, 
reporting an attempt by the Ba'al Shem Tov to ascend on the ladder of prayers of his 
Hasidim into Paradise to capture the dove. The failure of the Ba'al Shem's Hasidim to 
provide the spiritual support needed for this great endeavor, as symbolized by the 
collapse of their ladder of prayers, is offered as the reason for the failure to bring the 
Messiah in their generation. Thus the tale illustrates the interdependency of the Tzaddik 
and his Hasidim. This attempt to capture the golden dove and its failure marks one of 
the basic types of mystical tales, those concerning an attempt to hasten the coming of 
the Messiah. Several such tales are found in the Talmud. See, in particular, "Forcing 
the End," p. 496. Subsequently such tales are found in virtually every generation, 
explaining that there is a potential Messiah who, had all gone well, would have served 
as Messiah ben Joseph, preparing the way for Messiah ben David. In this tale of the 
Ba'al Shem, however, he ascends directly to the palace of Messiah ben David, deter- 
mined to initiate the End of Days. For a variant of this tale, see "The Messiah and the 
Ba'al Shem Tov," following. For a talmudic tale about a golden dove, see B. Ber. 53b.

621 . THE MESSIAH AND THE BA'AL SHEM TOV 

The Messiah once came to the Ba'al Shem Tov and said: "I make my home in a heavenly 
palace known as the Bird's Nest. Except for me, no one has ever entered there. If only you 
were to travel there and open that gate, redemption would surely come to Israel. I don't 
know whether or not you will succeed in opening the gate, but I heard God's voice say- 
ing to me, 'What can I do for you, since I must fulfill your wish.'" 

This brief account about the Messiah speaking to the Ba'al Shem Tov is attributed 
to Rabbi Menahem Nahum of Chernobyl (1730-1797). Here the Messiah strongly hints 
to the Ba'al Shem Tov that he can bring about the messianic era — and set the Messiah 
free from his waiting — by making his way to the heavenly Garden of Eden and open- 
ing the gate to the secret abode of the Messiah, known as the Bird's Nest. Further, the 
Messiah suggests that God will look favorably on the efforts of the Ba'al Shem Tov, 
because God feels that he must fulfill the Messiah's wish — which is to initiate the 
messianic era. Thus, in this brief tale, the Messiah not only gives the Ba'al Shem Tov 
the key hint of how this can be done, but strongly suggests that the time is right. This 
fragmentary tale does not inform us of what happened next, which would be a heav- 
enly journey by the Ba'al Shem Tov to fulfill the quest. But the fact that the Messiah 
has not yet come speaks for itself. 



492 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 


In a variant of this mythic tale, "The Ladder of Prayers," p. 490, the Ba'al Shem Tov 
ascends to Paradise and tries to capture the golden dove of the Messiah, which the 
Messiah cannot bear to be without, and in this way force the coming of the Messiah, a 
process known as "Forcing the End." Here, too, the quest ultimately fails. Although 
this is considered a sin, it is the one sin the rabbis had tremendous sympathy toward, 
since they longed, above all, for the coming of the Messiah. 

In both of these tales, the Ba'al Shem Tov is portrayed as the only figure in his 
generation capable of bringing the Messiah. This follows the pattern of Messiah ben 
Joseph, the earthly Messiah, who, it is said, will pave the way for the coming of the 
heavenly Messiah, Messiah ben David. Thus the Ba'al Shem Tov is identified in these 
tales with Messiah ben Joseph. In each generation the Tzaddik ha-Dor, the greatest sage 
of his generation, exists as a potential Messiah. If the time is ripe and the sage is able 
to fulfill his role, he will serve as the earthly Messiah who sets in motion the coming 
of the heavenly Messiah.

622. THE MESSIAH AT THE GATES OF ROME 

The Messiah sits at the entrance of the gates of Rome. Around him sit the poor, wrapped 
in bandages, suffering from disease. Like them, the Messiah is bandaged from head to 
toe. When the beggars are ready to change their bandages, they unwind them all at the 
same time. But the Messiah changes them one by one, in case he should be summoned, 
so that he will be ready. 

Like the beggars and lepers around him, the Messiah is wrapped in bandages, suf- 
fering from some unstated disease, presumably leprosy. The story also suggests how 
close the Messiah is to coming— he's already at the gates, waiting for the signal from 
heaven that the messianic era has finally arrived. This is one of the myths about a 
suffering Messiah. "The Captive Messiah," p. 498, is another example of this type. 

This myth about the Messiah emerges out of an unusual dialogue between Elijah 
the Prophet and Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. Rabbi Joshua is said to have once found Elijah 
standing at the entrance of the cave of Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai. Rabbi Joshua asked 
him, "When will the Messiah come?" Elijah replied, "Go ask him yourself." Joshua 
ben Levi asked where the Messiah could be found, and Elijah answered that he sits 
among the beggars at the gates of Rome. The story goes on to relate that Rabbi Joshua 
sought out the Messiah there and asked when he would come. The Messiah's enig- 
matic answer was, "Today." Rabbi Joshua returned to Elijah and said that the Messiah 
had lied to him, because he had said he was coming that day and he did not. Elijah 
replied, "What he told you was that he would come, if you would but heed his charge this 
day" (Ps. 95:7). Thus, the Messiah is ready to come, but we are not ready for him. See 
by way of contrast, Franz Kafka's "The Coming of the Messiah," p. 518.

623. THE CHAINS OF THE MESSIAH 

Long ago, in the city of Hebron, there lived a man named Joseph della Reina whose 
longing for the Messiah was so great that he spent his life in mystical study and prayer, 
seeking to learn how the coming of the Messiah might be hastened. It was in those days 
that the holy book of the Zohar was discovered, and Joseph della Reina saw this as a sign. 



THE EARTHLY MESSIAH 493 


Surely the gate of the Messiah's palace was open, and the time had come for the Messiah 
to pass through that gate, so that his footsteps could be heard in the world. 

Thus della Reina sought out ten other scholars who also devoted themselves to mysti- 
cal meditation. Together they fasted and mortified themselves, so that they might purify 
their souls, Joseph della Reina more so than any of the others. They studied the kabbalah 
day and night, immersing themselves in its mysteries. And they scattered ashes on their 
heads, crying and mourning over the destruction of the Temple. 

At last Joseph della Reina so purified his soul that the Prophet Elijah descended from 
on high and taught him mysteries that had never been revealed outside of heaven. In this 
way he learned that the soul of the Messiah was being held captive by the forces of evil, 
and not until those forces had been defeated could the chains of the Messiah be broken. 
Most of all, Joseph della Reina wished to know how to set free the captive soul of the 
Messiah. But Elijah was reluctant to tell him any more, for it was forbidden to reveal this 
mystery. Then Joseph della Reina said to Elijah: "If you yourself cannot reveal this secret, 
can you give me the name of an angel I might invoke?" And at last Elijah relented and 
revealed the holy names that invoke the angel Metatron, who once had been Enoch be- 
fore being transported to heaven in a chariot and transformed into the fiery angel Metatron, 
the Prince of the Presence. 

Then Joseph della Reina and his followers began to fast from the end of one Sabbath to 
the beginning of the next. And, as Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai had done, they ate only carobs 
and drank only water. Now it is said that at midnight on the eve of Shavuot the heavens 
split open, and any prayer said at that time reaches to the highest heavens. So Joseph 
della Reina and his followers waited until that moment, and then he pronounced the 
holy names that Elijah had given him to invoke the angel Metatron. Thunder rang out all 
around them and lightning split the sky, and the heavens parted and a great light shone 
from on high that so blinded them they fell on their faces in fear. And the voice of Metatron 
rang out so loudly that the earth shook beneath their feet. "What is it you want?" the 
voice demanded. At first Joseph della Reina was speechless, but he finally found the strength 
to prostrate himself before the Prince of the Presence and he said: "Surely the time has 
come for the Messiah to be set free from his chains. Tell us how this can be done, and we 
will set out to accomplish this quest, no matter how difficult." 

"The victory that you seek over evil would bring you into the gravest danger. Now is 
the time to turn back," said Metatron. But Joseph della Reina refused to give up and 
begged the angel to assist them. And at last Metatron revealed this fateful secret: that the 
rulers of the forces of evil, Ashmedai, the King of Demons, and Lilith, his Queen, could 
be found in the form of black dogs living on Mount Seir. And if they could be captured 
and put in chains and led away from that mountain, which was their home and the source 
of their strength, they could be defeated. Then the chains holding back the Messiah would 
break, and the time of his coming would be at hand. But, Metatron warned him, those 
demons were very powerful, and the only way to weaken them was to deny them every 
kind of sustenance. They must be given nothing, neither food nor water, until they were 
led away from the mountain, or all would be in vain. So too did Metatron reveal the holy 
names that would transport della Reina and his followers to Mount Seir and permit them 
to capture the demons who reigned there. 

When Joseph della Reina heard this, his soul exulted, for now the quest he had sought 
for so long lay open before him. And he thanked Metatron from the depths of his soul 
and vowed that he would do everything in his power to fulfill that quest. But before 
departing, Metatron warned him not to take on such a great responsibility unless he was 
certain he would not fail, for if he did, the time of the coming of the Messiah would be 
delayed much longer. And at that moment the heavens closed and the vision came to an 
end, but Joseph della Reina and his followers felt they had been reborn, for now the path 
of their destiny had opened before them. 



494 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 


Once again they fasted and prayed and prepared themselves for the day of reckoning. 
So too did they prepare many links of chain, with God's Name on every link, with which 
to restrain the demons. At last Joseph della Reina, surrounded by his ten disciples, pro- 
nounced the holy names in the proper combination, and an instant later they f ound them- 
selves at the foot of Mount Seir. There they heard an unearthly howling, and certain that 
this must be a sign, they set out in that direction. 

At last they caught sight of two great black dogs howling at the moon. That howling 
was so terrible it filled them with dread, but still they crept closer until they were right 
behind them. And just as they threw the chains around the dogs, Joseph della Reina 
pronounced the holy names that made them his prisoners. As soon as he did, Ashmedai 
and Lilith were restored to their true forms and tried to break free. But when the demons 
realized they could not, they no longer struggled but began to beg for something to eat or 
drink. Their pleas were piteous indeed, but Joseph della Reina spurned them, and he and 
his followers led them in chains down the mountain. 

Now when they had almost descended the mountain, Ashmedai and Lilith became so 
weak that they had to be dragged, and their pleas for sustenance grew more urgent. But 
when they saw that della Reina would show them no mercy, they begged instead for a 
single whiff of incense to revive them. Then della Reina took pity on them, for he did not 
see any danger in that, and he lit the incense and let them each take a whiff of it. But at 
that instant Ashmedai shot up many times his size and the chains that held him shat- 
tered, as did Lilith's. Ashmedai was filled with rage, and he picked up the ten followers 
of Joseph della Reina and cast them a great distance, so that all of them lost their lives. 
And when he found Joseph della Reina cowering behind a rock, he picked him up and 
cast him a distance of hundreds of miles, where he landed with a great crash. 

The next thing Joseph della Reina knew, he found himself transformed into a large, 
black dog, wandering through the streets of a city. And the soul of Joseph della Reina, 
which was trapped in the body of that black dog, recognized that city at once as Safed. 
Now della Reina was horrified to discover himself in the body of that dog, and he suf- 
fered the pangs of hell. Now, too, all hope he had once held for the coming of the Messiah 
was shattered, and his singular longing was simply for his own soul to be set free. 

So it was that the black dog that bore the soul of Joseph della Reina hid near the windows 
of the yeshivahs of Safed and listened to the teachings of the sages and learned, in this way, 
that there was a righteous man living in the city of Safed at that time who was known as the 
Ari, and that he alone possessed the mystical powers to set della Reina's soul free. 

Soon the Ari found that a black dog followed him everywhere. There was nothing he 
could do to get rid of it. At last the Ari's disciples asked him about the dog that pursued 
him like a shadow, and the Ari replied: "That dog was once the holy sage Joseph della 
Reina, who sought to shake the heavens so that the footsteps of the Messiah might be 
heard. Instead he failed in his task and brought the wrath of heaven upon himself, and 
now he has been reborn as this black dog. He wants me to set him free, but that is not his 
fate. This is just the first of a thousand rebirths he will have to suffer through before his 
soul can be freed of the taint of his sin." And when the black dog, who had listened 
carefully to every word, learned of his fate, he lost his mind and ran howling into the 
wilderness and was never seen again. 

After the talmudic legend of the four who entered Paradise, this is probably the 
best-known kabbalistic tale of all. It exists in a number of versions and has been re- 
printed many times. The two primary versions are those of Eliezer ha-Levi and Shlomo 
Navarro. Ha-Levi's earlier account presents Joseph della Reina as a sincere, if over- 
ambitious, prophet who is willing to take great risks to hasten the coming of the Mes- 



THE EARTHLY MESSIAH 495 


siah and suffers a terrible failure. Navarro's version transforms the character of della 
Reina, emphasizing his hubris and adding a coda in which, having failed in his mes- 
sianic quest, he becomes a student of black magic, taught by none other than Lilith, 
the demoness he originally sought to capture. His later exploits, in the version of 
Navarro, include using his powers to bring Queen Dolphina of France to his bed and 
attempting to bring Helen of Troy back from the dead for himself. The present version 
of this tale is based primarily on the earlier version. For a version based primarily on 
that of Navarro, see "Helen of Troy" in Lilith's Cave, pp. 42-52, and the accompanying 
note. Eli Wiesel's novel The Gates of the Forest also includes a retelling of the story of 
Joseph della Reina, p. 18. 

Just as the myth of the four who entered Paradise (p. 445) served as a warning tale 
about the dangers of kabbalah, so did the story of Joseph della Reina, and he became 
an archetype of the holy man driven mad by immersion in kabbalistic mysteries. The 
story of Joseph della Reina being reborn as a black dog, so full of poetic justice be- 
cause of its echo of the forms taken by Ashmedai and Lilith when he sought to capture 
them, is associated with the legend of the Ari. It demonstrates that as early as the 
sixteenth century, della Reina became a despised figure even by those who themselves 
still sought to hasten the coming of the Messiah. See "The Captive Messiah," p. 498.

624. THE MESSIAH COMES FORTH FROM PRISON 

At the end of the wars of Gog and Magog, the Messiah shall come forth from prison with 
nothing except for his staff and his sack. Then the Messiah will wrap himself in prayer 
and gird himself as a hero before God. The Messiah will say before Him: "Master of the 
Universe, remember on my behalf the suffering and grief and darkness and obscurity 
into which I was cast. My eyes have beheld no light and my ears have heard great revil- 
ing, and my heart broke with pain and grief. You know that I have not acted for my own 
glory, nor for the glory of my father's house, but for Your glory have I acted, and for Your 
children who dwell in sorrow among the peoples of the world." 

Then the Messiah will say to the children of Israel: "Go and assemble all your brethren 
from all the nations." And they will go and assemble all Israel and bring them to stand 
before the Messiah, as it is said. And they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations as 
an offering to Yahweh (Isa. 66:20). 

This myth describes the emergence of the Messiah at the End of Days. The Messiah 
has been imprisoned, but the time finally comes when he is set free. Then the first 
thing he does is remind God of his suffering and that of the people of Israel, and he 
sets out to accomplish the first of the messianic requirements — the Ingathering of the 
Exiles. See "The Suffering Messiah," p. 489 and "The Chains of the Messiah," p. 492 
for myths about the suffering of the Messiah.

625. UNTIL THE REDEMPTION 

Before his death, the Rabbi of Riminov let it be known that he would not set foot in the 
Garden of Eden until the time of the Messiah had come. After his death, the angels sought 
to convince him to enter, for he had long been awaited, but he refused. They sought to 



496 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 


lure him into the Garden by showing him many wonderful things, but their efforts were 
in vain. Still, it was not yet time for the Messiah to come. So they asked King David to 
play on his harp, and when that haunting music drifted out of the Garden and reached 
the Rabbi of Riminov, he followed after it as if in a trance, and in this way he was lured 
inside at last. 

Likewise, Rabbi Shalom Rokeach, the Belzer Rebbe, once said, "One time I dreamt that 
I was brought to Gan Eden and shown the walls of Jerusalem. The walls were in ruins and 
a man was walking on them. I asked, 'Who is that man?' I was told that this is Rabbi 
Israel Ba'al Shem Tov. He has sworn not to come down from there until the Temple is 
rebuilt." 


There are quite a few stories about rabbis who vowed not to enter Gan Eden until the 
Messiah had come, but were somehow seduced into entering the Garden. The Rabbi of 
Riminov (1755-1815) and the Belzer Rebbe (1779-1855) are both great Hasidic masters, 
and, of course, the Ba'al Shem Tov is the founder of Hasidism. Their links to this tale of 
the refusal of the heavenly reward were intended to emphasize their great hope in the 
coming era of the Messiah, which would have to include the rebuilding of the Temple. 

Among others who refused to enter the Garden of Eden was the Rabbi of Ujhely, 
who was finally lured into the Garden by an invitation to give a d'var Torah , a sermon. 
Because awareness of time doesn't exist in the Garden, he is said still to be speaking. 
See also "The Pact" in Gabriel's Palace , pp. 256-257, about three rabbis who make a vow 
to force the coming of the Messiah.

626. THE CONCEALMENT OF ELIJAH 

Elijah has gone into hiding and will reappear only at the advent of the Messiah. 

Elijah is often identified as the herald and precursor of the Messiah. Here Elijah is 
said to have gone into hiding until the advent of the messianic era. The point is that 
just as the Messiah is hidden, waiting for the time when his footsteps will be heard, so 
too is Elijah concealed until it is time for him to fulfill his role in the messianic drama. 

This myth runs contrary to the widespread appearance of Elijah in the rabbinic, 
folk, kabbalistic, and Hasidic lore.

627. FORCING THE END 

In every generation there are three sages who together possess the power to force the 
coming of the Messiah. In the time of the ancient sages, it was Rabbi Hiyya and his sons. 
Elijah the Prophet was a regular visitor to the synagogue of Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi, but one 
day he was late. When they asked him why, he said, "I had to waken Abraham, wash his 
hands, let him pray, and return him to sleep; likewise with Isaac and with Jacob." 

They asked him, "Why couldn't you waken them together?" Elijah answered, "If they 
were to pray together, their power could bring the Messiah before his time." They asked, 
"Are there any like them in this world?" Elijah replied, "Only Rabbi Hiyya and his sons." 



THE EARTHLY MESSIAH 497 


That day Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi decreed a fast and let Rabbi Hiyya and his sons lead the 
prayers. When Rabbi Hiyya said, "He causes the wind to blow," the wind began to blow. 
When he said, "He causes the rain to fall," rain began to fall. 

As he was about to say the line, "He resurrects the dead," they said in heaven, "Who 
has disclosed this secret?" and the angels replied, "Elijah." They brought Elijah before 
the heavenly court and gave him sixty lashes of fire. After that Elijah appeared in Rabbi 
Judah's synagogue as a fiery bear, and chased everyone out. 

Over the generations these three sages existed, but rarely did they live near each other, 
nor did they know that this great power could be theirs if they joined together. But the 
Seer of Lublin uncovered this secret and revealed it to the other two sages. All of them 
were filled with a terrible longing for the Messiah. So they made a pact to force the Mes- 
siah to come on Simhat Torah of that year. 

Now it happened that just before Rosh ha-Shanah, Baruch of Medzibozh took sick and 
died. Twenty-two days later, on Simhat Torah, the news of Rabbi Baruch's death had 
reached the Riminov Rabbi, but not the Seer of Lublin. The Riminov Rabbi recognized at 
once that he must not proceed in the plan to force the End of Days. But the Seer of Lublin 
knew nothing about it, so on Simhat Torah he danced with the Torah in his arms, and 
then he went to the second floor and prayed alone there for several hours. 

Just as he reached the conclusion of His prayers, the Seer of Lublin suddenly felt a 
great force from behind push him out the open window. He would have met a certain 
death, but just before he struck the ground he felt as if a net had caught him. Looking up, 
he saw Baruch of Medzibozh standing there, and found that he had landed on his tallit, 
which Rabbi Baruch had spread out below. Then the Seer understood that Rabbi Baruch 
must have died, and that he had come back from the Other World to save him. And he 
understood as well that the time had not come for the footsteps of the Messiah to be 
heard in this world. 

Not long afterward the Seer of Lublin also took sick, and he died on the Ninth of Av of 
that year, the day the Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed. 

Both of these accounts, one talmudic and one Hasidic, describe how three rabbis, 
the greatest of their generation, attempted to force the coming of the Messiah. In the 
first, Elijah inadvertently reveals one of the key secrets of heaven — that Rabbi Hiyya 
and his sons have the righteousness and purity of the patriarchs, and therefore have 
the power to force the coming of the Messiah. This they attempt to do by reading 
prayers that cause the actions they describe to take place. This causes consternation in 
heaven, for they are on the verge of forcing the coming of the Messiah. So Elijah is sent 
to earth as a fiery bear, chasing them out of the synagogue before they can complete 
their invocation. 

The second tale identifies three great Hasidic rabbis, the Seer of Lublin, Reb 
Menachem Mendel of Riminov, and Baruch of Medzibozh, as the ones in their genera- 
tion with such great power. 

These three rabbis agree to use a mystical secret to force the coming of the Messiah 
on Simhat Torah, but the death of Baruch of Medzibozh ends their plan. When the 
rabbi of Riminov learns of this, he does not attempt to bring the Messiah. But because 
the Seer of Lublin does not receive word of Baruch's death in time, he does make the 
attempt, which almost costs him his life, when he is pushed out of a window. This 
clearly demonstrates the anger in heaven at this attempt. However, the Seer's life is 
saved by the spirit of Baruch of Medzibozh, who sees to it that the Seer lands on his 
tallit. And the Seer of Lublin understands at that moment that Baruch must have died, 
and that his spirit had come back from the World to Come to save him. Both tales 
demonstrate the dangers of attempting to hasten the coming of the Messiah, as well as 
the strong impulse to do so among the rabbis. Both also explain why the Messiah has 
not yet come. 



498 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 


An interesting parallel to this tale is found in Sefer Eliyahu in Beit ha-Midrash 3:68- 
78. Here the prophet Elijah comes to Rabbi Yose's House of Study, and tells Rabbi Yose 
of hearing God and the Messiah discussing the messianic prophecies of the prophet 
Isaiah. Just then Samael, the Accuser, came and accused the Israelites of being guilty. 
This caused Elijah to be dejected, but Rabbi Yose grows angry at Elijah, for he sees it 
differently, perceiving a hint of the coming of the Messiah in the discussion of God 
and the Messiah. Then Rabbi Yose reinterprets Isaiah's words, I will tell of your righ- 
teous deeds and all his works, but they will not help at all (Isa. 57:12), to mean, I will tell of 
the righteous deeds of Israel and all the works of Samael will not help at all. This transforms 
Isaiah's expression of grief and hopelessness into a prophecy of messianic hope.

628. THE CAPTIVE MESSIAH 

For many generations the Messiah has sat captive, chained with golden chains before the 
Throne of Glory. Elijah has tried to release him many times, but he has never succeeded. 
So Elijah descends to earth and explains that in order to break the chains of the Messiah, 
he needs a magic saw whose teeth are the deeds of Israel. Every deed adds a tooth to this 
saw, but every sin takes one away. When there are twice as many good deeds as there are 
sins, then the saw can be used. That is why it is said that the Messiah will not come until 
we bring him. 

A number of texts describe the Messiah as bound in chains. According to Pirkei 
Hekhalot Rabbati, for example, God will tie up the Messiah hand and foot for eight 
years, and during the years that the Messiah is fettered, God will hide His face from 
him. This is a reminder that the decision of bringing the End of Days, which the Mes- 
siah will herald, does not belong to the Messiah, but to God, or to the people Israel, 
whose good deeds will make it possible. Adding to the complexity, there are even 
myths in which God Himself is in chains. See "Mourning over the Shekhinah," p. 58.

629. THE SLEEPING MESSIAH 

Eighty years ago, in a Polish yeshiva, there were two students who were filled with a 
longing for redemption. Both of them were eager to travel to the Holy Land, and they 
especially wanted to see King David's tomb. They dreamed about it day and night, and 
at last they decided to set out on the journey, even though they didn't have any money. 
On the way they met with many obstacles, but at last they arrived at the holy city of 
Jerusalem. They were thrilled to have arrived there safe and sound, but they did not 
know how to find King David's tomb. While they were wondering where it was, Elijah 
the Prophet appeared before them in the form of an old man and showed them the way. 
And when they reached the foot of Mount Zion, Elijah said: 

"Now my sons, ascend Mount Zion until you reach the entrance of King David's tomb, 
and enter there and go down the steps, until you reach the bottom of the tomb. There you 
will be blinded by visions of gold, silver, and diamonds. These are only illusions, set to 



THE END OF DAYS 499 


tempt you from your purpose. Ignore them and search for the jug of water at the head of 
King David. That jug contains water from the Garden of Eden. Pour the water from that 
jug over the hands of King David as he stretches his hands toward you. Pour the water 
three times over each hand, and then King David will rise up and the footsteps of the 
Messiah will be heard in the world. For King David is not dead, he lives and exists. He is 
only asleep and dreaming, and he will arise when we are worthy of it. By your virtue and 
merit, he will arise and redeem us. Amen, and may this come to pass." 

When Elijah finished these words, he disappeared. The young men then ascended 
Mount Zion, and went down into the depths of King David's tomb. Everything was just 
as Elijah had said it would be. They saw King David lying on a couch, with a jug of water 
at his head. And when they reached King David, he stretched out his hands to them. But 
just then the young men were blinded by all the riches they saw in that tomb, and they 
forgot to pour water onto the king's outstretched hands. In anguish his hands fell back 
and immediately the king's image disappeared. 

The young men were startled when they realized that they had let the opportunity for 
redemption slip through their fingers, but it was too late. 

This is one of many tales about King David being alive. All of them grow out of the 
saying, David Melekh Yisrael, hai ve-kayyam — "David, King of Israel, lives and exists" — 
taken from the Talmud (B. RH 25a) and turned into a song that remains very popular 
among Jews to this day. Here King David's role as a great king and founder of Jerusa- 
lem is blended with messianic prophecy, and it is King David himself who is identi- 
fied as the sleeping Messiah, waiting for someone righteous enough to pour water 
from the Garden of Eden over his hands so that he will wake up. This tale, like so 
many others concerning the Messiah, explains why the Messiah has not yet come. For 
another example of such a tale, see "The Ladder of Prayers," p. 490.

630. THE PANGS OF THE MESSIAH 

When the time has come for the Messiah to arrive, all the kings of the nations of the earth 
will be at war with one another. All the nations of the world will be agitated and fright- 
ened. The wisdom of the scribes will become foolish, and those who shun sin will be 
despised. The meeting place of scholars will be laid to waste and given over to harlotry. 
Pious men and saints will be few, and the Law will be forgotten by its students. The 
young will insult their elders, and the elders will wait upon the young. Arrows of hunger 
will be sent forth, and a great famine will arrive, as it is said, "A time is coming ," declares 
Yahweh, " when I will send a famine upon the land: not a hunger for bread or a thirst for water, but 
for hearing the words of the Lord" (Amos 8:11). Then, all at once, they will all be seized with 
pangs like the pangs of a woman in labor. At that time Israel will cry out in fear, and God 
will reply, "My children, be not afraid. The time of your redemption has come." 

The struggles that will take place before the advent of the Messiah are known as 
the "Pangs of the Messiah." These pangs are said to include a great war to be known 
as the War of Gog and Magog. For Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira, who experi- 
enced great upheaval firsthand in the Warsaw Ghetto, the purpose of the Pangs of the 
Messiah is to cleanse sins before the Messiah's arrival. For him, these pangs make it 
possible for Israel to give birth to the Messiah. He links these pangs to God's words to 
Eve, "In pain shall you bear children" (Gen. 3:16), and he observes that before a seed can 
bring forth a new creation, the seed must be annihilated. In the same way, the "Pangs 



500 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 


of the Messiah" refers to the annihilation that must take place before the birth of a 
new creation. Israel must suffer birth pangs in order to give birth to the light of the 
Messiah.

631. THE RAINBOW OF THE MESSIAH 

Do not expect the Messiah until a rainbow appears radiating splendid colors throughout 
the world. At present, the colors of the rainbow are dull, serving merely as a reminder 
that there will not be another Deluge. But the rainbow that announces the Messiah will 
have brilliant colors and be adorned like a bride for her bridegroom. When this rainbow 
appears, it will be a sign that God has remembered His covenant with Israel, and that the 
footsteps of the Messiah will soon be heard. 


In Genesis 9:12-13, God says about the rainbow: "This is the sign that I set for the 
covenant between Me and you, and every living creature with you, for all ages to come. I have 
set My bow in the clouds, and it shall serve as a sign of the covenant betiueen Me and the 
earth." The rainbow serves as a covenant between God and all living creatures that 
God will not bring on another Deluge, as in the time of Noah. The present myth of the 
rainbow of the Messiah identifies the rainbow as another kind of covenant, that of 
bringing Israel out of exile. This Ingathering of the Exiles is one of the requirements of 
the coming of the Messiah. Here the transformed rainbow, its colors restored to their 
heavenly perfection, becomes a sign of the impending arrival of the messianic era.

632. CALCULATING THE END OF DAYS 

When there are signs that the Messiah is ready to come, many righteous individuals will 
raise their voices. They will scream until their throats become hoarse— and it will do no 
good. For whenever it is predicted that the Messiah will come at a certain time, it can be 
certain that he will not come in any manner whatsoever at that time. Furthermore, any- 
one who tries to calculate the End of Days will be severely cursed. For the Messiah will 
come only when the minds of men are distracted from thinking of him. 

For many centuries, predictions were rampant about when the Messiah would ar- 
rive. Pious Jews always hoped it would be in their lifetimes. Of course, all of these 
predictions fell through. Here Rabbi Nachman suggests that it is time to give up mak- 
ing such predictions, for they inevitably fail. He even suggests that it is the prediction 
itself that causes the failure. This seems to be the application of the general belief that 
if we want something too much, we will never get it. It is remarkably parallel to Franz 
Kafka s paradox that 'The Messiah will not come until he is no longer needed." In 
Rabbi Nachman's version, the Messiah will not come until the people give up on wait- 
ing for him and instead live a pious life without constant thought of their reward. See 
"The Coming of the Messiah," p. 518.

THE END OF DAYS 501 


633. THE END OF DAYS 

In the world we know, men walk in the light of the sun by day and in the light of the 
moon at night. But in the End of Days, No longer shall you need the sun for light by day , nor 
the shining of the moon for radiance by night (Isa. 60:19). In what light, then, will men walk? 
Yahweh shall be your light everlasting (Isa. 60:19). 

In the coming era there will not be any eating or drinking, or procreation, or trade, nor 
will there be jealousy or hatred. Instead, the righteous will sit with crowns on their head, 
and feed on the splendor of the Shekhinah. 

The messianic era, known as the End of Days, is described as a kind of heaven on 
earth. Or it might be viewed as a return to the Garden of Eden. Indeed, all of Jewish 
history can be encapsulated between the exile from Eden and the messianic era with 
its return to a prelapsarian era like that of the Garden of Eden. Or the messianic era 
might be seen as a kind of eternal Sabbath, a permanent state of rest.

634. THE END OF THE WORLD 

In the generation when the Messiah comes, fiery seraphim will be sent into the Temple, 
and stars will appear like fire in every place. The glory of the Shekhinah will fill the Temple, 
and God will bring down His throne and set it in the Valley of Jehoshaphat. At that time 
God will clothe the Messiah with a diadem, and He will place a helmet of salvation on his 
head, and gird him with brilliance and splendor. He will also adorn him with glorious 
garments and place him on a high mountain, and the Messiah will announce, "Salvation 
is near!" Then the Messiah will proclaim the news to the patriarchs and to Adam, who 
sleeps in the cave of Machpelah. And Adam will immediately stand up along with his 
generation, as well as the patriarchs and all the generations from the beginning of time to 
the last day 

The age of the Messiah will last 400 years, and after that the Messiah shall die, along 
with all in whom there is human breath. Then the world will be turned back to primeval 
silence for seven days, as it was at the beginning of Creation, as it is said. The heavens shall 
melt away like smoke , and the earth shall wear out like a garment (Isa. 51:6). 

This is a supernatural portrayal of the End of Days, where the transformation of 
the world will be evident to everyone and the presence of divine figures, including 
God, the Messiah, and angels (in the form of fiery seraphim), will be experienced in 
this world. It includes the rebirth of the great figures of the past, such as Adam and 
the patriarchs, which is one of the requirements of the Messiah. This, then, is an ulti- 
mate fantasy of redemption, when the messianic era that was awaited so long finally 
arrives. 

Of interest, however, is the 400-year time limit associated with this description of 
the messianic age. After that, it is said that the world will come to an end, to be fol- 
lowed by resurrection and judgment.

502 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 


635. HOW THE END OF THE WORLD WILL COME 

On the day of the end of the world, happy and joyous people will come out of the earth. 
They will beat drums and play flutes and all other musical instruments. They will travel 
from east to west, toward the Holy Land. The mountains before them will turn into a 
blooming garden. Every tree will bear fruit, and the stones will turn to meat and rice, and 
the people will eat to their hearts' content. After this the Messiah will come, and he will 
separate those who are believers from those who are not. The nonbelievers will go to 
Gehenna, and the believers will journey with the Messiah to Jerusalem. That is how the 
end of the world will come. 

This a folk version of the onset of the messianic era. It follows the essential mythic 
pattern in which the dead are restored to life — these are the people who climb out of 
the earth, the righteous are gathered to the Holy Land, and the arrival of the Messiah 
takes place. The details about every tree bearing fruit and stones turning into food 
demonstrate that the folk understanding of the messianic era is one in which people 
will still retain the desire to eat, and there will not be any shortages of food.

636. THE VISION OF THE VALLEY OF DRY BONES 

The hand of the Lord came upon me. He took me out by the spirit of the Lord and set me 
down in the valley. It was full of bones. He led me all around them; there were very many 
of them spread over the valley, and they were very dry. He said to me, "O mortal, can these 
bones live again?" I replied, "O Lord God, only You know." And He said to me, "Prophesy 
over these bones and say to them: O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord! Thus said the 
Lord God to these bones: I will cause breath to enter you and you shall live again. I will lay 
sinews upon you, and cover you with flesh, and form skin over you. And I will put breath 
into you, and you shall live again. And you shall know that I am the Lord!" 

I prophesied as I had been commanded. And while I was prophesying, suddenly there 
was a sound of rattling, and the bones came together, bone to matching bone. I looked, 
and there were sinews on them, and flesh had grown, and skin had formed over them; 
but there was no breath in them. Then He said to me, "Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, 
O mortal! Say to the breath: Thus said the Lord God: Come, O breath, from the four 
winds, and breathe into these slain, that they may live again." I prophesied as He com- 
manded me. The breath entered them, and they came to life and stood up on their feet, a 
vast multitude. 

And He said to me, "O mortal, these bones are the whole House of Israel. They say, 'Our 
bones are dried up, our hope is gone; we are doomed.' Prophesy, therefore, and say to 
them: Thus said the Lord God: I am going to open your graves and lift you out of the 
graves, O My people, and bring you to the Land of Israel. You shall know, O My people, 
that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves and lifted you out of your graves. I will 
put My breath into you and you shall live again, and I will set you upon your own soil. 
Then you shall know that I the Lord have spoken and have acted" — declares the Lord. 

The belief in the bodily resurrection of the dead can be traced to this powerful 
biblical myth of Ezekiel, in which God compels him to resurrect, with his prophesy- 
ing, the bones in the valley of the dry bones. Here God's intention to bring the people 
of Israel back to life is presented as an explicit promise, with a powerful demonstra- 



THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD 503 


tion of God's ability to fulfill it. In messianic myth, the resurrection of the dead be- 
comes one of the three primary requirements that must be fulfilled to initiate the mes- 
sianic era. The others are the Ingathering of the Exiles and the rebuilding of the Temple 
in Jerusalem. 

Ezekiel's vision of resurrection was taken by later Jewish sources as a scriptural 
basis for a literal belief in resurrection. In the Talmud, for example, it is stated that "in 
the future the pious will sprout up and emerge in Jerusalem, and they will rise up in 
their garments" (B. Ketubot 111b). And chapter 34 of Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer, an impor- 
tant midrashic text, states that "God opens the graves and opens the storehouses of 
the souls and puts back each soul into its own body." 

Still another version of the resurrection of the dead is found in the Responsum ofHai 
Gaon 60a-b: "And God will stretch sinews upon them and cover them with flesh and 
envelop them with skin, but there will be no spirit in them. And then God will cause 
the dew of life to descend from heaven, in which there is the light of the life of the 
soul. And they will recognize that they had lived and died and then risen to life." 

There is a debate in B. Sanhedrin 92b as to whether the resurrection of the dead as 
described in Ezekiel should be understood literally or taken as a parable: "Rabbi Eliezer 
said, 'The dead who were resurrected by Ezekiel stood up and sang songs of praise to 
God and immediately died.' Rabbi Judah said the story is a true event that served as a 
parable. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yose said, 'The dead who were resurrected by Ezekiel went 
up to the Land of Israel, married and begat sons and daughters.' Hearing this. Rabbi 
Judah stood up and said, 'I am one of their descendants. You see these tefillinl They 
were given to me by my grandfather and once belonged to them!"' It seems likely that 
we are to understand Rabbi Judah's comments as a sarcastic response to Rabbi Eliezer 
ben Yose's literalism. However, this debate also serves as evidence of belief in the 
resurrection in Judaism, where it is listed as the last of the Thirteen Principles of 
Maimonides.

637. HOW THE DEAD WILL COME TO LIFE 

How will the dead come to life? God will take the Great Shofar in His hand and blow on 
it seven times, and its sound will go forth from one end of the world to the other. 

At the first blast, the whole world will shake and suffer the pangs of the Messiah. 

At the second blast, dust will be scattered over the face of the earth and the graves will 
open. 

At the third, the bones will gather together. 

At the fourth, the limbs will stretch out. 

At the fifth, skin will be stretched over them. 

At the sixth, spirits and souls will enter the bodies. 

At the seventh, God Himself will raise and resuscitate them and make them stand on 
their feet. 

The Great Shofar is the second horn of the ram that Abraham slew at Mount Moriah. 

The first ram's horn was blown by Moses at Mount Sinai. In most messianic tradi- 
tions, it is said that Elijah will blow the second horn. Here, however, it is God who 
blows on it to initiate the End of Days. It is also said that God will blow this shofar 
when He leads the exiles of Israel into their land. See Isaiah 27:13. 

The portrayal of the stage-by-stage resurrection of the dead is strongly influenced 
by Ezekiel's vision of the valley of dry bones (Ezek. 37:1-14). Both take place in stages, 
but in the present myth these stages, delineated by the blast of the Great Shofar, are 
similar to the creation of Adam in Genesis. 



504 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 


An alternate version of the resurrection in Pesikta Hadta states that "God will bring 
dust of the earth and dust of the dead, and mix them together, and put into it skin and 
flesh and sinews and bones. And the angel in charge of souls will come and infuse 
souls into the bodies. Then they will enter the House of Study where Abraham, Isaac, 
and Jacob sit before God, the kings of Israel and Judah sit behind Him, and David sits 
at the head."

638. THE DEW OF RESURRECTION 

From where does the dew of resurrection descend? From the head of God, as it is said, 
"For My head is drenched with dew, My locks with the damp of night" (S. of S. 5:2). When the 
time comes to resurrect the dead, God will shake His locks and bring down the dew of 
resurrection, and by means of that dew, all the righteous dead will rise from the dust. 

Others say that after the reviving dew descends, God will seat each person between 
His knees, and embrace them and kiss them and bring them to life in the World to Come. 

This myth finds its source in the verse For your dew is like the dew on fresh growth (Isa. 

26.19). In these myths, God takes a most active role in the resurrection. In other myths, 
the resurrection happens as the final stage of a process, or there is an angel who is 
charged with raising the dead. But here God is the source of the dew that brings about 
the resurrection. He even takes each person, one by one, to Himself, and brings him or 
her back to life. 

Note that the World to Come is identified here with the messianic era, although 
they usually refer to separate traditions, where the World to Come is the world of 
rewards for the souls of the righteous when they leave this world, and the messianic 
era refers to this world after its transformation at the End of Days. Maimonides de- 
fines the World to Come as follows: "The life after which there is no death is the life of 
the World to Come, in which there is no body, for the World to Come consists of souls 
with no bodies, like the angels" (Maimonides, Ma'amar Tehiyat ha-Metim). As for the 
messianic era, it will bring about a great transformation in which this world will be- 
come a paradise on earth. In effect, it will restore the whole world to the kind of pris- 
tine purity found in the Garden of Eden before the Fall. 

What is the dew of God? In Zohar 3:128a, Idra Rabbah, this dew is described as "the 
light of the pale glow of the Ancient One. And from that dew exist the supernal saints, 
and it is the manna which they grind for the righteous in the World to Come."

639. THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD 


God keeps the souls of the dead alive, and the dead wait, their eyes fixed upon the resur- 
rection. 

The patriarchs sought to be buried in the Land of Israel, because the dead in the Land of 
Israel will be the first to come to life. Not only Abraham and Sarah are buried there, but also 
Isaac and Rebecca and Jacob and Leah. So too are Adam and Eve said to be buried nearby. 



THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD 505 


In the days preceding the coming of the Messiah, great events will befall the world. 
Ten territories will be swallowed up, ten territories will be overturned, and ten territories 
will have their inhabitants put to death. 

When the Messiah comes, all mankind, the quick and those who were dead, will be 
one in the worship of God. In those days the dead of the Land of Israel will be the first to 
come back to life. The angel Michael will blow a great blast on the shofar, and the tombs 
of the dead will burst open in Jerusalem, and God will revive them. When the resurrec- 
tion comes, those who arise from the dead will see the Eternal Spirit returning to Zion 
through the Gate of Mercy. This gate has been blocked for many generations. Therefore it 
is said of this gate that it will not be opened until the eyes of Israel are opened at the End 
of Days. 

In the days of the Messiah, God will rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem and Israel will go 
up in pilgrimage not three times a year, but on every New Moon and Sabbath. How will 
it be possible for all flesh to come to Jerusalem? In those days Jerusalem is destined to be 
as large as the Land of Israel, and the Land of Israel as large as the whole world. And how 
can they come from the ends of the earth? Clouds will carry the children of Israel to 
Jerusalem, where they will say their prayers, and then the clouds will carry them back to 
their homes, as it is said. Who are these that float like a cloud? (Isa. 60:8). 

Then the walls of Jerusalem will disappear, and the Messiah will rebuild them with 
precious stones and pearls. The resurrected dead will inhabit this new Jerusalem, and 
they will be like Adam before he sinned. 

After that, the bones of the righteous outside the Land will roll through underground 
caves until they reach the Mount of Olives in the city of Jerusalem. There God will restore 
their souls to them, and they will arise and enjoy the days of the Messiah along with 
those who have already come alive in the Land. And those who are resurrected will not 
die again and return to dust. But just as God endures forever, so they will live forever. 
God will give them wings and they will float in the air and fly like angels to the Garden 
of Eden, where they will learn Torah from God. 

Based on Isaiah 26:19: Oh , let Your dead revive! Let corpses arise! Awake and shout for 
joy , you who dwell in the dust! — For Your dew is like the dew on fresh growth ; You make the 
land of the shades come to life. Belief in the resurrection of the dead is the thirteenth of 
Maimonides' Thirteen Principles. One of the key requirements of the messianic era is 
the Ingathering of the Exiles, while another is the resurrection of the dead. This key 
myth describes how that resurrection will take place in the End of Days, along with 
the ingathering of the righteous dead from where they are buried around the world. 

Here it is understood that in the days of the Messiah the dead of the Land of Israel 
will rejoin the living, and the righteous dead outside the Land will return to the Land 
and come to life again. 

The three patriarchs and their wives are believed to be buried in the Cave of 
Machpelah in Hebron. Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 20 reports that Adam and Eve are also 
buried there. 

In the days of the Temple, there were three pilgrimages a year, at the time of the 
agricultural festivals of Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot. Here it is imagined that in the 
messianic era these pilgrimages will take place much more often, on every new moon 
and Sabbath, with the people being carried to Jerusalem on clouds. This last detail 
demonstrates that although the dead will be brought to life, the nature of existence in 
the messianic era will be markedly different from what it was before the End of Days. 

The question of whether the dead can be resurrected at all is raised and answered 
in Pesikta Rabbati 48:2: "Successive generations have asked: 'Can we believe that a 
dead man can be brought back to life?' God replied: 'Why do you have doubts as to 
whether I shall be able to quicken the dead? Have I not already quickened the dead by 
the hand of Elijah, by the hand of Elisha, and by the hand of Ezekiel? That which is to 



506 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 


be in the time to come has already been in this world.'" This demonstrates that even 
among believers, there was some doubt about the resurrection of the dead. But it also 
provides a convincing reply from God, who points out that such resurrection is re- 
ported three times in the Bible.

640. HOW THE RESURRECTION WILL TAKE PLACE 

On the day that God brings the dead back to life. He will take dust of the earth and dust 
of the dead and knead them together, and out of the two kinds of dust He will draw 
bones and sinews. Then God will give the word to the angels in charge of the Treasury of 
Souls, and out of the treasuries they will take every single soul, thrust each one into a 
body, and instantly all humankind will stand up. 

This is a description of the resurrection of the dead that closely parallels the origi- 
nal creation of Adam. Just as God took the dust of the earth to make Adam, here God 
combines the dust of the earth and the dust of the dead and re-creates human beings, 
giving them souls from the Treasury of Souls. In this view of the resurrection at the 
End of Days, those who have died will not receive their original bodies, but new ones. 

See "The Treasury of Souls," p. 166.

Eliyahu Zuta 20:31-31. 


641. THE WORLD TO COME 

There are no bodies in the World to Come, only the souls of the righteous, who are bodi- 
less, like the ministering angels. Since there are no bodies, there is no eating or drinking, 
nor anything that human bodies require in this world. So too there is no sleep or death, 
sadness or mirth. That is why the sages said, "The World to Come has neither eating, nor 
drinking, nor sex in it, but the righteous sit with their crowns on their heads and enjoy 
the splendor of the Shekhinah." Thus the souls of the righteous exist there without toil, 
but the knowledge they acquired in their lifetimes remains with them. Indeed, because 
of it they merited the life of the World to Come. Thus the crowns that they wear are the 
crowns of knowledge. And there, in the World to Come, they enjoy the splendor of the 
Shekhinah , for now they can grasp the truth of God that they did not know when they 
were burdened with a body. 

Whoever believes in the two worlds — this world and the World to Come — will be con- 
sidered a descendant of Abraham. But whoever does not, will not be considered his seed. 

This myth is a reminder that life in the World to Come will be radically different 
from life in this world, and, in fact, will lack many of the pleasures associated with the 
living, such as the enjoyment of eating, drinking, and sex. Even the crowns that rabbinic 



THE WORLD TO COME 507 


literature describes as being worn by the righteous in heaven are here presented in meta- 
phorical terms — as crowns of knowledge. It seems clear that this more naturalistic de- 
scription of the World to Come was intended to counter rabbinic and folk traditions of 
heavenly rewards that consist of gold and other precious items, such as the golden 
tables said to be awaiting the righteous in Paradise, as described in B. Ta'anit 24b-25a.

642. THE GREAT AGE 

When the whole of creation, visible and invisible, comes to an end, each person will go to 
the Lord's judgment. And all who are judged righteous will be gathered together into the 
great age, and it will be eternal. For all time will perish, and afterward there will be 
neither years nor months nor days, and hours will no longer be counted. There will be 
instead a timeless, single age. Then those who have been judged righteous will have the 
great indestructible light of Paradise, and it will serve as the shelter of their eternal resi- 
dence. And the faces of the righteous will shine forth like the sun. 

Even after existence ends, the righteous will be sheltered eternally by the light of 
Paradise. Thus Paradise, with its attendant rewards, will continue to exist when ev- 
erything else is gone.

2 Enoch 65:6-11. 

643. LIFE IN THE WORLD TO COME 

What will life be like in the World to Come? God will be seated in His great academy, and 
seated in His presence will be the righteous of the world, along with their wives, their 
sons, their daughters, their manservants, and their maidservants. The needs of their house- 
holds will all be provided for them. There will be no hunger or thirst or sexual desire, but 
the righteous will feast on the splendor of the Shekhinah . 

Here the righteous not only have God as their teacher, but this myth portrays a 
vision of the afterlife as a continuation of life among the living, where they will be 
surrounded by their families, servants, and all that they required when they were 
alive, except for food and drink. The study of Torah, in classes led by God or one of 
the great patriarchs or sages, is a standard feature in descriptions of the World to 
Come. But in Eliyahu Rabbah other, more elemental rewards of the World to Come are 
described, where the righteous continue to be surrounded by their families in the 
afterlife. 

Sources: 

Eliyahu Rabbah 4:19. 


644. THE CHORUS OF THE RIGHTEOUS 

In the days to come, God Himself will lead the chorus of the righteous. He will sit in their 
midst in Paradise, and they will dance around Him like young maidens, and point to Him 
with a finger, saying: "For God — He is our God forever; He will lead us evermore" (Ps. 48:15). 

But there are those who say that this dance will take place in Gehenna, where there is 
a great deal of space. How can the righteous live in the habitation of the wicked? The 
righteous will implore mercy for the wicked, and their sins will be pardoned. 



508 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 


This is a portrait of the afterlife that presents it as a place of great rejoicing, where 
the righteous will dance around God and celebrate His glory. This, then, is the reward 
of the righteous for occupying themselves with Torah study in this world. 

The surprising alternate version, where the righteous dance in Gehenna instead of in 
Paradise in order to implore mercy for the wicked, adds a merciful purpose to their 
dance that provides them with a mission in the World to Come. The implication is that 
even in Paradise the righteous have a duty to assist others, as they did in this world.

645. FAT GEESE FOR THE WORLD TO COME 

In one of his travels Rabbah bar Bar Hannah came across two geese. Because of their 
fatness, their feathers had fallen out. Rivers of oil flowed from under them. Rabbah asked 
one of the geese if he would deserve to eat from it in the World to Come. One of the geese 
raised a foot, as if to say, this will be your portion. The other goose raised a wing, as if to 
say, this is your portion from me. 

A feast for the righteous is one of the rewards for the righteous in the World to 
Come. One of these rewards is a great banquet, for which these geese are being saved. 

They are so fat and succulent that rivers of oil flow from under them. See the follow- 
ing myth, "The Messianic Banquet." 

Sources: 

B . Bava Batra 73b. 


646. THE MESSIANIC BANQUET 

In the time to come God will prepare a banquet for the righteous from the flesh of Behe- 
moth, Leviathan, and the Ziz, as it is said, He prepared a lavish feast for them (2 Kings 6:23). 
God will say to them, "Do you want cider or citrus or grape wine?" Then God will leave 
His glorious throne, and sit with them. Who will be seated at the table? The Patriarch 
Jacob along with scholars and distinguished students. The rest of Leviathan will be spread 
on the walls of Jerusalem, and its radiance will shine from one end of the world to the 
other. So too will God make a sukkah for the righteous with the skin of Leviathan. 

Others say that God will serve the Messiah-ox and messianic wine at the banquet. The 
Messiah-ox makes its home in Paradise, where it waits to fulfill its destiny when the 
Messiah comes. Then it will be slaughtered and served at the messianic banquet. Then 
God will bring the righteous wine that had been preserved from grapes from the six days 
of Creation. Only once before has it been served: when Jacob served wine to his father, 
Isaac, at the time he brought the food that Rebecca had prepared. Since Jacob had no 
wine with him, an angel provided some for him, and the angel brought that messianic 
wine. And he gave it into Jacob's hand, and Jacob handed it to his father, and he drank. 

Of all the patriarchs, why is it that it will be Jacob who will join them at the feast? 
When the children of Israel sin, only Jacob in the Cave of Machpelah feels defiled. So 
when the gladness of redemption comes, Jacob will rejoice in it more than any of the 
other patriarchs, for he alone will be called to the feast. 



THE WORLD TO COME 509 


This myth describes a great feast, prepared by God, that will take place after the 
coming of the Messiah. It finds its origin in this messianic prophecy in Isaiah 25:6: The 
Lord of Hosts will make on this mountain for all the peoples a banquet of rich viands , a banquet 
of choice wines — of rich viands seasoned with marrow ; of choice wines well refined. Those 
most deserving will taste the flesh of Leviathan. Here the righteous are described as 
scholars and distinguished students, reinforcing the notion that study of the Torah is 
the most important occupation of all. In addition, they will be joined by the Patriarch 
Jacob. The inclusion of Jacob alone suggests the tendency to elevate Jacob to great 
heights because of the identification of Jacob and Israel. See "Jacob the Angel," p. 364 
and "Jacob the Divine," p. 366. 

The Book of Paradise, a midrashic satire by Itzik Manger, has the blind Isaac, living in 
heaven, mark his portion on the Messiah-ox, which will be slaughtered when the 
Messiah comes. This satirizes Isaac's apparent love of the taste of venison. In one 
episode, someone plays a trick on the Messiah-ox by telling it that the Messiah has 
come — and therefore it is about to be slaughtered. In terror the ox runs out of Jewish 
heaven into Christian heaven — heaven consists of three parts, according to Manger, 
the third being Muslim heaven — and the Christians refuse to give him back. This re- 
quires a series of messages between King Solomon and Saint Paul, who rule Jewish 
and Christian heaven respectively. Eventually, the Messiah-ox is returned in Manger's 
novel, but it is badly underfed, and there is some question about whether it is fit to be 
served at the messianic banquet. 

In the frame story of Manger's satire, the angel Shmuel Abba is commanded to be 
reborn, and he manages to get the angel who is to deliver him to earth drunk by 
giving him messianic wine. On the day the angel is born, he sits up in the cradle and 
he tells the history of his life in Paradise to his astounded parents and all those who 
assemble to hear him.

647. THE MESSIANIC TORAH 

The Torah of the mundane world is worthless compared to the Messianic Torah of the 
World to Come. This Torah will taught by the Messiah, or, some say, even by God Him- 
self. This is the Torah that God delights in, which is studied by the righteous in the World 
to Come. It begins with aleph , the first letter of the alphabet, while the earthly Torah 
begins with bet , the second letter. 

Study of the Torah will continue in the World to Come, but the Torah that will be 
taught there will be far more profound than the Torah of this world. This is the Torah 
that God delights in, and from which the righteous learn in the heavenly Garden of 
Eden. This notion of a transformed text is also found in the traditions concerning the 
first tablets of the Law that were given to Moses on Mount Sinai. See "The First Tab- 
lets," p. 266. 

For the kabbalists, such as Hayim Vital of Safed in the sixteenth century, the true 
meaning of the Torah was not in its literal meaning, but in the secret, inner meanings. 
Further, redemption — i.e., the messianic era — could only be achieved by means of 
kabbalah. Hayim Vital's description of the Torah of this world as relatively "worthless" 
might seem shocking, but since the mundane dimension of the Torah concerns rules 
relevant to human beings, it has no relevance in the World to Come. In fact, in one 
midrash Moses convinces the angels that they have no need for the Torah, since it is 
relevant only to humans. However, kabbalists are discarding only the literal level of the 
Torah; the higher levels of interpretation are considered to contain infinite mysteries. 



510 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 


The notion of a Messianic Torah grows out of the tradition that there are two To- 
rahs in Judaism, an Oral Torah and a Written Torah. See "The Two Torahs," p. 277. For 
more on the tradition that the Messiah will teach Torah in the World to Come, see 
"The Messiah's Yeshivah," p. 518.

648. A TABERNACLE FOR THE RIGHTEOUS 

In the time to come God will bring the skin of Leviathan and make a tabernacle for the 
righteous, as it is said. Can you fill his skin with tabernacles? (Job 40:31). If a man is worthy, 
a tabernacle will be made for him. If he is not worthy, a mere cover of fish skin will be 
made for him, as it is said. And his head with a fish covering (Job 41:7). The rest of the skin of 
Leviathan will be spread by God on the walls of Jerusalem and the roof of the sanctuary, 
and its splendor will shine from one end of the world to the other. Then the righteous of 
Israel will sit, eat, drink, be fruitful, multiply, and enjoy the splendor of the Shekhinah. 

This myth is obviously a companion to "The Messianic Banquet." Just as "The 
Messianic Banquet" describes the extravagant banquet God will provide to the righ- 
teous in the World to Come, so this myth describes the kind of shelter they will re- 
ceive, as food and shelter are a person's most essential concerns. The implication is 
that each person will have an individual shelter, a sukkah made of the skin of Levia- 
than, or, if one is not worthy of that, made of fish skin. 

A further example found in Talmud says that God will provide a necklace for the 
righteous in the World to Come, but if they are not worthy of it, they will receive an 
amulet instead. 

These related myths not only describe the kind of rewards expected in the messi- 
anic era, but also imply that people can expect to retain their individuality as well as 
their desire for privacy in the World to Come, and that God will fulfill these needs. 

Even the need to be fruitful and multiply will be fulfilled. As Seder Gan Eden puts it, 
"Every woman among the Israelites will give birth to children every day."

649. THE NEW JERUSALEM 

It is stated that " New moon after new moon , and Sabbath after Sabbath , all flesh shall come to 
worship Me" (Isa. 66:23). How is it possible that "all flesh" shall fit into Jerusalem every 
new moon and every Sabbath? Because in the End of Days, when there is a new heaven and 
a new earth (Isa. 66:22), Jerusalem is destined to expand its length and breadth, and be- 
come as large as the whole of the Land of Israel, and the Land of Israel as large as the 
world. 



MESSIANK JERUSALEM 511 


The mystical transformation of Jerusalem so that there will be room for "all flesh" 
to enter there from one new moon to the next as well as from one Sabbath to the next 
is linked with the myth of the transformation that will take place in the messianic era, 
so that all the righteous, including those living outside the Land of Israel, will come to 
Jerusalem, and there will be room for all of them. That will be the initiation of messi- 
anic Jerusalem.

650. MESSIANIC JERUSALEM 

When all the population is resurrected and gathered together in the messianic era, where will 
they all stand? They will all say. The place is too crowded for me; make room for me to settle (Isa. 
49:20). So God will add to Jerusalem a thousand gardens, a thousand palaces, and a thousand 
mansions, until the future Jerusalem is three times the size of the present one. Then God will 
enlarge Jerusalem until it rises to the heavens. God will raise it from one heaven to another, 
until it reaches the seventh. Some say: until it reaches the Throne of Glory. 

How does it rise? With clouds sent by God, while each of the righteous has a canopy of 
his own, as it is said. Over all the glory shall hang a canopy (Isa. 4:5). As soon as Jerusalem 
reaches the Throne of Glory, God will say, "You and I will walk together through the 
universe." 

Others say that Jerusalem will expand on earth until it reaches Damascus, for Jerusa- 
lem is destined to widen on all sides, and the exiles will come and repose beneath it as 
they would beneath a fig tree. 

This myth wrestles with the problem of where to fit all the righteous who are resur- 
rected at the End of Days. Jerusalem just isn't big enough to hold everyone, so it is 
proposed that God will raise Jerusalem to heaven. An alternate version suggests that 
the boundaries of the city will simply be expanded, something that has already hap- 
pened with the modern state of Israel, though not all the way to Damascus. See "The 
New Jerusalem," p. 510. 

Some versions say that God will provide seven canopies for every righteous per- 
son, or that God will make a canopy for every one according to his status.

651. THE GOLDEN GATE OF THE MESSIAH 

At the End of Days, God shall lower the heavenly Jerusalem to take the place of the 
earthly Jerusalem that was destroyed. The Temple will be established, and a pillar of fire 
shall burst forth from inside the Temple as a sign to all who witness it. 

Then, at God's command, two angels shall recover the Golden Gate of Jerusalem from 
where it is hidden under the earth, and they shall raise it back to its original place. Abraham 
shall stand to its right and Moses and the Messiah shall stand to its left, and all Israel 
shall come forward through the gate. 



512 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 


The Golden Gate is another name for the Gate of Mercy in Jerusalem, which has 
long been covered over. Here God restores it to its original place, and it becomes the 
gate that Israel passes through to enter the new world created at the End of Days. The 
Gate of Mercy is also linked to the Shekhinah, who is said to have left Jerusalem through 
this gate after the Temple was destroyed, and who will one day return to Jerusalem 
through that same gate. See "The Wandering of the Shekhinah ," p. 55.

four golden mountains, as it is said. In the days to come, the Mount ofYahweh's house shall 
stand firm above the mountains (Isa. 2:2). Its height will reach to heaven, to the stars and to 
the wheels of the Chariot. And the Bride of God will fill it, and God's glory will fill its 
hall, and inside each angel will be busy with his work, Gabriel and Michael and their 
myriads. And at Zion's restoration, the very mountains will burst into song. The moun- 
tain of the Lord's house will lead in the singing, and the lesser mountains will answer. 

The Holy of Holies of the future Temple will be built of twelve onyx stones. The radiance 
of the Holy of Holies will illuminate the entire world and ascend to the Throne of Glory. 

How will people go there? They will fly like clouds and like doves. In this way great 
multitudes will enter the Temple to be blessed with eternal life. 

In some myths all of the heavenly Jerusalem descends to earth, coming to rest on 
three or four mountains. In others, such as this myth, it is the Temple alone that de- 
scends upon the mountains. Here the image of the Temple dominates the upper world, 
while the Temple itself is filled with God's presence, both His Bride, the Shekhinah , 
and His glory. 

In Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 21:4 it is said that God will bring three mountains, Sinai, 

Tabor, and Carmel, together and build the Temple on top of them. 

In 1860, Tzvi Hirsch Kalischer, an early Zionist, defined his anti-mythological view 
in Derishat Zion: "God will not suddenly descend from on high and command his 
people to go forth. Neither will he send the Messiah from heaven in a twinkling of an 
eye, to sound the great trumpet for the exiles of Israel and gather them into Jerusalem. 

He will not surround the holy city with a wall of fire or cause the holy Temple to 
descend from heaven." Here we find a list of supernatural events that were tradition- 
ally expected to occur in the time of the Messiah, including the descent of the heav- 
enly Temple. But Kalischer dismisses all of these, writing instead that "the redemption 
will come through natural causes by human effort ... to gather the scattered of Israel 
into the Holy Land."

653. THE CREATION OF THE THIRD TEMPLE 

At the End of Days, the Ingathering of the Exiles will take place, the Temple in Jerusalem 
will be rebuilt, and the footsteps of the Messiah will be heard. Even now, God is secretly 
building the third Temple far under the earth. When the days of the Messiah are upon us, 
the third Temple will rise up from below, with the Dome of the Rock balanced on top of it. 



MESSIANIC JERUSALEM 513 


One of the primary requirements that the Messiah must fulfill in order to demon- 
strate that he is indeed the true Messiah is to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. This 
requirement appears impossible at this time, since the Dome of the Rock has been 
built on the Temple Mount, on what is commonly regarded as the place where the 
Temple once stood. Indeed, some messianic groups in Israel have plotted to blow up 
the Dome to pave the way for the Temple to be rebuilt. But such a reckless act could 
inflict a disaster on Israel. 

Under these circumstances. Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi (1924-) has offered 
this ingenious myth, which resolves the problem of how the third Temple can be built 
on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. It is a peaceful solution to an otherwise unresolvable 
dilemma.

654. REBUILDING THE TEMPLE 

In the hour of the Redemption, when God remembers His covenant with Israel, the Temple 
in Jerusalem will be rebuilt. God will say to the Shekhinah, "Rise from the dust," and she 
will answer, "Where should I go, since My house is destroyed and My Sanctuary is burnt 
to the ground?" Then God will say, "Do not grieve, for I Myself shall rebuild it, a perfect 
structure." 

Some say that God will then bring the mountains of Sinai, Tabor, and Carmel together 
and rebuild the Temple upon their peak. That is the meaning of the verse And nations shall 
walk by your light , kings , by your shining radiance (Isa. 60:3). Then the Temple will sing 
aloud, and the mountains will answer the song. So too will Jerusalem serve as a beacon 
to all of the nations, and they will walk in her light. 

Others say that God will raise up the Temple from the dust and renew it, and its gates, 
which are buried in the earth, will rise up, every one in its place. And God will reestab- 
lish the Sanctuary, and rebuild the city of Jerusalem. Then the Shekhinah shall arise and 
shake off the dust and the Ingathering of the Exiles shall begin. 

One of the key events of the messianic era will be the rebuilding of the Temple. 

This is one of the requirements that must be fulfilled prior to the return of the Shekhinah 
from exile. It is understood that this Third Temple, of divine origin, will be eternal, 
and will never be destroyed. An extensive description of the future Temple is found at 
the end of the Book of Ezekiel, chapters 40-48, beginning with a vision: The hand of 
Yahiveh came upon me, and He brought me there . He brought me, in visions of God , to the 
Land of Israel, and He set me down on a very high mountain (Ezek. 40: 1-2). 

In one version of this myth from Pesikta de-Rav Kahana, it is said that God will bring 
three mountains together and build the future Temple there. In most other sources, 
the rebuilding of the Third Temple takes place in Jerusalem. And as soon as the Temple 
is rebuilt, the Shekhinah will return from Her exile at the time the Temple, Her home in 
the world, was destroyed. 

In Pesikta Rabbati 31:5, God describes the covenant between Himself and Israel, 
where both are responsible for bringing about the End of Days: "My Torah is in your 
hands, and the End of Days in Mine. Each of us has need of the other. If you need Me 
to bring the time of redemption, I need you to keep My Torah so as to hasten the 
building of My Temple and Jerusalem. And just as it is impossible for Me to forget the 
time of redemption, so you must never forget the Torah."

514 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 


655. THE MESSIANIC SPRING 

In the future, when the voice of the Messiah proclaims salvation from a high mountain, 
waters will rise up from under the threshold of the Temple, as it is said, A spring from the 
house of Yahweh will go forth and water all the valley (Joel 4:18). Every field and vineyard 
watered by those streams will yield fruit, even those that had never yielded fruit before. 
And everyone who is ill who bathes in those waters will be healed, as it is said. The water 
will become wholesome (Ezek. 47:8). Those waters will generate all kinds of fish, and those 
fish will ascend in that stream as far as Jerusalem, where they will leap into the nets of 
fishermen. And those fish will be as sweet as manna. Floating above that spring, the 
Temple court will appear to be a small vessel, as it is said. Behold water from a vessel (Ezek. 
47:2). 

Some say that spring will branch into twelve streams, one for each of the twelve tribes. 
Others say that it will form a river that will cleanse every impurity, uncovering treasures 
that have been hidden for centuries. Even the Angel of Death will not be able to cross it. 

Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer identifies the Dead Sea as the place where the waters will 
heal, and gives the prooftext from Ezekiel 47:8. 

There is a parallel tradition about a river that cannot be crossed — the River 
Sambatyon, which is said to flow wildly six days a week, trapping the Ten Lost Tribes 
on one side of it, and only ceasing to flow on the Sabbath, when they are not permit- 
ted to cross. There is also a parallel tradition about a place where the Angel of Death 
cannot enter — the city of Luz. Therefore all the inhabitants of that city are immortal, 
as long as they do not leave the city. See "The City of Luz," p. 476. For another account 
of a miraculous spring, see "The Healing Spring," a Hasidic tale about the Ba'al Shem 
Tov, in Gabriel's Palace , pp. 207-298.

656. A MAGICAL TREE IN JERUSALEM 

When the third holy Temple is built, a magical tree will grow in Jerusalem. Some say that 
the leaves of that tree will cause the dumb to speak. Others say that the leaves of that tree 
will cause barren women to bear children. 

The image of the magical tree is well known in Jewish folk and rabbinic texts, al- 
though it is usually associated with the Garden of Eden, especially with the two trees 
in the center of the garden, the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge. The image of 
the tree is also closely associated with that of the Torah, because of the verse She is a 
tree of life to those who grasp her (Prov. 3:18). 

Here the tree is associated with the building of the Third Temple, which will only 
take place at the time of the coming of the Messiah. This demonstrates an important 
parallel between the story of the Garden of Eden and the messianic era — in both en- 
chanted trees can be found. Indeed, there is a direct parallel in Jewish myth between 
the prelapsarian world and the messianic era. Thus one function of the coming of the 
Messiah is to restore the world to its pre-fallen state. This parallel is an implicit part of 
the myth of the Ari. See "The Shattering of the Vessels and the Gathering of the Sparks," 

p. 122. 

The theme of healing leaves is found in world folklore. See, for example, "The 
Wonderful Healing Leaves," a universal fairy tale of Jewish origin, in Elijah's Violin , 
pp. 163-168. This theme is found in Jewish lore as well. Abraham is said to have col- 



THE PLEADING OF THE FATHERS 515 


lected leaves from the Garden of Eden and Sarah to have crushed them on the eve of 
the Sabbath and scattered their powder into the air, creating the spice of the Sabbath. 
See "The Spice of the Sabbath," p. 316. For a Hasidic tale on this theme, see "Leaves 
from the Garden of Eden" in Gabriel's Palace , pp. 134-135, where a man finds enchanted 
leaves on his bed when he awakes after a dream in which a stable boy who has died 
brings him leaves from the Garden of Eden to heal the man's sick daughter. Her mourn- 
ing over the boy's death provoked her illness, and his miraculous assistance heals her.

657. THE PLEADING OF THE FATHERS 

In the hour that Israel was exiled, the fathers of the world, along with the mothers, were 
raised from their graves in the Cave of Machpelah and brought up to the firmament and 
began a great mourning before God. 

God joined them from the highest heaven and said, "Why are you mourning?" 

They replied: "Master of the Universe, what sins did our children commit that You did 
this to them? Are You not going to have mercy on them? Are You not going to show 
compassion?" 

God replied, "Because of their wickedness, they were punished by exile." 

The Fathers said, "But will You remember them in their exile among the nations of the 
world, or will You become oblivious to them?" 

God answered, "I cannot now save them from their exile, but I swear by My name that 
I shall never forget them, and one day their exile shall come to an end." 

These words of God greatly comforted the fathers and mothers, and they returned 
and lay down in their tombs. That is why, when the Messiah comes, he will go to the 
Cave of Machpelah to wake them first. 

Here the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their wives gather before God to 
plead for their children, Israel, who have been sent into exile. Because of their el- 
evated roles, the patriarchs are able to speak their mind to God. In effect, they give 
voice to the sense of injustice felt among Jews in the Diaspora. The plea of the patri- 
archs and matriarchs moves God, who assures them that one day — the day the Mes- 
siah comes — their exile will come to an end. 

This myth finds its source in Jeremiah's vision or imagining of Rachel haunting her 
tomb and weeping for her exiled children: A cry is heard in Ramah — wailing , bitter weep- 
ing — Rachel weeping for her children. She refuses to be comforted for her children , who are 
gone (Jer. 31:15). (According to 1 Sam. 10:2, Rachel's tomb was located near Ramah.) 
Indeed, Jeremiah's account of Rachel weeping is the biblical source for all subsequent 
myths about biblical figures reappearing to comfort Israel. 

This myth is also parallel to those found in the Zohar in which the Shekhinah, the 
Bride of God, confronts God over the destruction of the Temple and the exile of Israel. 

This myth also explains why the patriarchs and matriarchs will be the first to be resur- 
rected in the messianic era. 

In the version of this myth in Seder Gan Eden , there is a less consoling ending. The 
angel Michael, the prince of Israel, weeps in a loud voice, "Why, O Lord , do you stand 
aloof" (Ps. 10:1). See the following myth, "Waking the Fathers," as well as "The Patri- 
archs Seek to Comfort Jerusalem," p. 420.

516 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 


658. WAKING THE FATHERS 

Why were the patriarchs buried in the Land of Israel? Because the dead of the Land will 
be the first to come to life in the days of the Messiah. 

In the hour that God crowns the Messiah, Israel will say to him: "Go and bring the 
glad tidings to those who sleep in the Cave of Machpelah, so that they shall be the first to 
arise/' 

Then the Messiah will go to the Cave of Machpelah and say to the Fathers: "Abraham, 
Isaac, and Jacob, arise! You have slept long enough." And they will reply and say, "Who 
is it who uncovers the dust from our eyes?" And he will reply, "I am the Messiah of the 
Lord. The hour of salvation is near." And they will answer, "If that is really so, then go to 
Adam, the first man, and bring the tidings to him, so that he should be the first to arise." 

Then the Messiah will go to Adam and say, "Arise, you have slept enough!" And 
Adam will reply, "Who is this who drives the sleep from my eyes?" And he will reply, "I 
am the Messiah of the Lord, one of your descendants." 

At that instant Adam will stand up, along with his generation, and Abraham, Isaac, 
and Jacob, and all the righteous and all the tribes and all generations from the beginning 
of time will arise and chant psalms and songs of jubilation. 

Tradition holds that the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, known as the Avot 
or Fathers, and their wives, are buried in the Cave of Machpelah in Hebron. Midrashic 
legend also recounts that Adam and Eve are buried there. The initiation of the messi- 
anic era will herald the resurrection of the dead, beginning with Adam, the first man, 
and the patriarchs. 

This myth is almost certainly based on a talmudic one (B. BM 85b) about the visits 
of Elijah to the synagogue of Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi. Elijah is the key figure in heralding 
the Messiah, as it is said that he will blow the great shofar that announces his coming. 

This talmudic tale sets the pattern for the waking of the patriarchs at the time of the 
coming of the Messiah. See "Forcing the End," p. 496. 

The previous myth, "The Pleading of the Fathers," also explains why the patri- 
archs will be the first to be awakened when the Messiah comes.

659. THE FATHERS ADDRESS THE MESSIAH 

In the month of Nisan the patriarchs will arise and say to the Messiah: "Our true Mes- 
siah, even though we came before you, you are greater than we because of all the suffer- 
ing you have endured for the iniquities of our children. You were shut up in prison, 
sitting in thick darkness, your skin cleaved to your bones, your body as dry as a piece of 
wood, and your eyes dim from fasting. Your strength was dried up like a potsherd, all 
because of the sins of our children. Now the time has come for you to come forth out of 
prison." 

The Messiah will reply: "O Fathers, all that I have done is only for your sake and that 
of your children, for your glory and for theirs, so that God will bestow abundance upon 
Israel." 

Then God will make seven canopies of precious stones and pearls for the Messiah. Out 
of each canopy will flow four rivers, one of wine, one of honey, one of milk, and one of 
pure balsam. And God will put a garment upon the Messiah whose splendor will stream 
forth from one end of the world to the other. And God will summon the north wind and 



THE PLEADINC OF THE FATHERS 517 


the south wind and say to them: "Come, sprinkle all kinds of spices from the Garden of 
Eden before My true Messiah." Then God will embrace the Messiah in the sight of the 
righteous and bring him within the canopy where all the righteous ones, the mighty men 
of the Torah of every generation, will gaze upon him. 

After that God will lift the Messiah up to the heaven of heavens, and cloak him in His 
own glory. 

This myth, taking place in Paradise, portrays the Messiah as a divine figure whose 
time has finally come to fulfill his destiny and initiate the messianic era. Here the 
patriarchs address him as an equal, and speak to him with great gratitude and affec- 
tion for his long suffering. God then provides great rewards for the Messiah, embrac- 
ing him in the presence of the righteous. The purpose of this myth is to reaffirm the 
centrality of messianic belief in Judaism and to demonstrate that the role of the Mes- 
siah is to be regarded as equally important as that of the beloved patriarchs. For more 
on the Messiah's suffering, see "The Suffering Messiah," p. 489.

Pesikta Rabbati 37:1-2. 


660. THE TWO MESSIAHS 

There are two Messiahs, as it is said. They are the two anointed dignitaries , who attend the 
Lord of all the earth (Zech. 4:14). The first Messiah is a son of Joseph, and the second a son 
of David. The son of Joseph, whom all will recognize as the Tzaddik of his generation, will 
sacrifice his life so that the footsteps of the Messiah might be heard, and the land shall 
mourn. The second Messiah, the son of David, makes his home in Paradise, in a heavenly 
palace, where he waits for signs that the time for the coming of the Messiah has arrived. 

Each Messiah has a separate role. Messiah, the son of David, will redeem the Shekhinah, 
along with all the holy sparks that were scattered during the six days of Creation. Mes- 
siah, the son of Joseph, will redeem the souls of those who fell through sin and transgres- 
sion, and were transmigrated into inanimate objects, vegetables, animals, and humans. 
He will free the souls of the righteous that were transmigrated into fish, and the souls of 
the righteous will be raised up. 

There are two primary conceptions of the Messiah in Judaism: one, the earthly 
Messiah, a descendant of Joseph, who is the righteous one of his generation; the other, 
a descendant of David, who serves as an instrument of salvation. Eventually these 
two conceptions were combined in a single myth in which the first, earthly Messiah, 
paves the way for the divine one.

661. THE MESSIAH PETITIONS GOD 

After Messiah the son of Joseph was slain, God said to his successor, Messiah the son of 
David, "Ask anything of Me and I will give it to you." 

Messiah the son of David, seeing that Messiah ben Joseph had been slain, said to God, 
"Master of the Universe, I ask of You only the gift of life." 



518 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 


God replied, "Your father, David, has already prophesied this about you, as it is said. 
He asked You for life ; You granted it , a long life , everlasting (Ps. 21:5). 

The primary messianic tradition in Judaism describes two Messiahs, Messiah ben 
Joseph and Messiah ben David. It is the fate of Messiah ben Joseph to pave the way for 
the heavenly Messiah, but to die in the process. One of the traditions about Messiah 
ben David is that he will prove that he is the true Messiah by bringing the slain Mes- 
siah to life. Here the heavenly Messiah petitions God to do this (since the ultimate 
power to restore life belongs to God), and God assures him it will happen, as proph- 
esied. For more on the roles of these two Messiahs, see the Introduction, pp. lxi-lxii.

662. THE COMING OF THE MESSIAH 

The Messiah will not come until he is no longer needed. He will not come until a day 
after his arrival. He will not come on the last day, but on the last of all. 

Kafka's paradoxical explanation of when the Messiah will come is so intriguing 
that it deserves a place in this collection of Jewish myths. It also reflects traditional 
Jewish teachings about the Messiah. The coming of the Messiah represents the initia- 
tion of the End of Days, the messianic era in which all of existence will be transformed, 
a return to a prelapsarian condition or a kind of heaven on earth. For this reason, the 
arrival of the Messiah is not important in itself; rather, it is the transformation that 
accompanies the arrival that matters. This is one way of understanding Kafka's com- 
ment that "The Messiah will not come until he is no longer needed."

Parables and Paradoxes by Franz Kafka. 


663. THE MESSIAH'S YESHIVAH 

In the future the Messiah will have his own yeshivah, and those who walk on earth will 
come there, sit before him, and hear his teachings. And Elijah will stand beside him as his 
interpreter. And when the Messiah expounds the Torah, his voice will reach from one 
end of the world to the other. 

That is when all the generations will rise up from their graves, filled with the Holy 
Spirit, and come sit in the Messiah's yeshivah, to hear tales and teachings from his mouth. 
And whoever hears a midrash from the mouth of the Messiah will never forget it, for 
God will reveal Himself in that House of Study and pour out His Holy Spirit upon all 
those who walk in the world. 

One of the highest honors among rabbis was to be the head of a yeshivah, a rab- 
binic academy. Here it is said that in the messianic era, the Messiah will have his own 
yeshivah, where he teaches both Halakhah (law) and Aggadah (non-legal teachings, often 
legends). (It is interesting to note that Aggadah is mentioned first, demonstrating its 
importance among the Yemenite Jews.) All Jews among the living will come to hear 
him, and the sound of his voice will resurrect the dead. This is a word-oriented form of 
initiating the messianic era, with the supernatural voice of the Messiah bringing about 
the resurrection. Note the central role given to Elijah, to interpret the teachings of the 
Messiah. This confirms the rabbis' central concept of the importance of commentary 



THE IN6ATHERIN6 OF THE EXILES 519 


and interpretation, as well as the notion that the chain of tradition in transmitting the 
Torah goes from God to Moses, Moses to the prophets, and the prophets to the rabbis. 

Of great interest is the way in which the Messiah, inspired by God's Holy Spirit, 
the Ruah ha-Kodesh, reveals God's essence, while God Himself is present in the yeshi- 
vah. It is also the Holy Spirit that brings the dead to life and brings its blessings to all 
of the living. 

Rabbinic myth portrays the World to Come as containing yeshivahs for all of the 
principal rabbis and patriarchs. One story told by Shlomo Carlebach describes a heav- 
enly journey to such academies. 

Another interesting aspect of this myth is the assumption that the Messiah would 
be a master teacher of the Torah. It also reinforces the archetypal quality of the Torah, 
which is just as important in heaven as it is on earth.

Midrashei Geulah . 


664. THE DUAL MESSIAH 

God said to Moses: "Moses, I swear to you, in the future to come, when I bring the prophet 
Elijah to herald the End of Days, the two of you will come as one. In that hour the Mes- 
siah will come and bring comfort to Israel." 

Thus the one known as the Messiah is actually two, for the Messiah is none other than 
Moses and Elijah come together as one. That is how God's vow to Moses will be fulfilled. 

Moses and Elijah are each models for the Messiah. For the Samaritans, Moses was 
virtually regarded as a messianic figure. Rabbinic concern that the role of Moses might 
come to transcend that of a prophet and take on messianic attributes may have been 
the reason that the role of Moses in the Exodus was almost entirely omitted from the 
Passover Seder. (Byron Sherwin suggests that this omission was triggered by the early 
Christian description of Jesus as the "new Moses.") As for Elijah, his messianic role is 
explicit — it is said that he will herald the coming of the Messiah, and will blow the 
shofar (ram's horn) from the ram that Abraham sacrificed on Mount Moriah in place 
of Isaac. (Moses is said to have blown the ram's other hom at Mount Sinai.) Thus, 
together Moses and Elijah have all of the attributes of the Messiah, and this radical 
midrash from Deuteronomy Kabbah goes a step further, stating that the Messiah will be 
Moses and Elijah "come together as one," suggesting that they will be reincarnated as 
a single figure.

Deuteronomy Rabbah 3:17 


665. THE INGATHERING OF THE EXILES 

The day of the Ingathering of the Exiles will be as great as the day on which the Torah was 
given on Mount Sinai. All Israel will be clothed in splendor and radiance, and the Shekhinah 
will walk at their head, with the prophets at their sides, bearing the Ark and the Torah. 

Jerusalem will not be rebuilt until all the exiles have been brought back. Then God will 
rebuild it and never destroy it again. 

In that hour the hands of every warrior will grow weak, and there will not be any 
weapons that are not destroyed. So too will every idol be destroyed, and God will rule 
from one end of the world to the other. 



520 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 


Indeed, the day of the Ingathering of the Exiles will be as important a day as the day 
when heaven and earth were created. 

The Ingathering of the Exiles thus the gathering of all the scattered Jewish com- 
munities in the world to the Holy Land — is one of the three requirements of the Mes- 
siah, along with rebuilding the Temple in Jerusalem and the resurrection of the dead. 

Here it is portrayed as a great caravan, with the Shekhinah, God's Presence, at the 
head. So too will Isaiah's prophecy that they shall beat their swords into ploughshares (Isa. 

4:2) be fulfilled, in that all weapons will be destroyed. 

The idea of the Ingathering of the Exiles so permeated Jewish life that it can be 
found in a dream of Hayim Vital from Sefer ha-Hezyonot 2:34: "I saw in a dream that I 
was walking along a great river, and I saw a multitude of Israelites there in tents. I 
entered and I saw their king reclining in the tent. When he saw me, he said, 'Know 
that I am the king of Israel, of the tribe of Ephraim, and we have come now because 
the time has come for the Ingathering of the Exiles/"

666. THE BIRTH OF ARMILUS 

In Rome there is a marble sculpture of a beautiful woman that was not created by human 
hands. Some say it was brought into being during the six days of Creation. It is also said 
that Satan lusts after it, and one day he will descend to earth, go to Rome, and copulate 
with it. And the stone will become pregnant. After nine months it will burst open and a 
male child will emerge in the shape of a man with two heads, twelve cubits high, his eyes 
set a span apart, crooked and bloodshot, his hair red, his feet green, with six fingers on 
each hand. That is how Armilus, the tempter, will be born. 

This is a grotesque myth about the birth of Armilus, who plays the role of the Anti- 
Christ in Jewish messianic mythology. Armilus is normally explained as a distortion of 
Romulus, who symbolizes Rome, which also symbolizes Christianity. This may suggest 
that Christianity is viewed in this myth as a monster born from Judaism. The alluring 
statue that Satan is predicted to copulate with is said, in some sources, to have been 
created during the six days of Creation. That adds a new dimension to the myth, as it 
indicates that God was the sculptor who created it, a fact that Satan surely knows. His 
copulation with the statue, from this perspective, is not an act of lust so much as an act 
of hostility toward God. And the product is a virtual Anti-Christ, Armilus, who, it is 
said, will conquer Israel before finally being defeated by the Messiah. 

This must also be seen as an allegory about the worship of idols, which, no matter 
how alluring, are made of stone. 

In some versions of this myth it is Satan who copulates with the statue, while in 
others her lovers are described as the "sons of Belial" (a biblical term for "worthless 
people"), who also succeed in impregnating her. In both cases, a grotesque male in the 
form of a grown man with two heads will emerge. This mythic origin of Armilus 
explains his supernaturally evil powers, especially in the version in which Satan is his 
father. 

The statue of the woman in this myth echoes the Greek myth of Niobe, whom Zeus 
turned into a statue. It is said that statue can be seen weeping copiously, while it is 
said of the statue in the myth of Armilus that it will become pregnant and will give 
birth. See Greek Myths by Robert Graves, 77c.

667. SATAN AND THE MESSIAH 

The Messiah existed in God's thought even before the world was created. After the cre- 
ation, God hid the Messiah under His Throne of Glory until the time was right for him to 
appear. 

Satan asked God, "Master of the Universe, for whom is the light hidden under Your 
Throne of Glory intended?" 

God replied, "For him who will turn you back and put you to shame." 

Satan said, "Master of the Universe, let me see him." 

God said, "Come and see him." 

And when he saw him, Satan was shaken and fell upon his face and said, "Surely this 
is the Messiah who will cause me to be swallowed up in Gehenna." 

Then, on the last day, Satan will endeavor to renew his rebellion against God. He will 
proclaim that he is God's equal, as well as God's partner in Creation, for while God 
created the earth, Satan created hell. Then the fire of hell will rise up and destroy Satan, 
and put an end to his talk. 

Here God reveals the Messiah to Satan. The dialogue between God and Satan may 
be contrasted with that in the prologue to Job. In Job there is no hostility between God 
and Satan; here it is quite apparent. In its structure, this myth is similar to that of 
Moses standing before the Throne of Glory and asking to see Rabbi Akiba, a thousand 
years in the future (B. Shabbat 88b-89a and B. Menahot 29b). In both cases, God has no 
difficulty in revealing these mysteries. The fate that Satan describes, of being swal- 
lowed up in Gehenna, derives from the verse He will destroy death forever (Isa. 25:8). 

While some sources describe Satan as having been created out of the fires of hell, 
here it is those fires that rise up and destroy him when, on the last day, Satan tries to 
renew his rebellion against God. See "The Fall of Lucifer," p. 108 and "Satan Cast Out 
of Heaven," p. 109.

668. THE ARRIVAL OF THE MESSIAH 

At that time all the nations of the earth will be in utter darkness. When the Messiah ap- 
pears, he will stand on the roof of the Temple, and he will make a proclamation to Israel, 
saying, "Behold my light as it rises upon you." Then God will brighten the light of King 
Messiah and all of Israel will be illumined by it, as well as all the other nations of the earth. 

The Messiah is able to stand on the roof of the Temple, because one of the require- 
ments of the time of the coming of the Messiah is the supernatural rebuilding of the 
Temple. This rebuilding precedes the actual coming of the Messiah, thus making it pos- 
sible for him to stand on the roof to announce his arrival. The light of which the Messiah 



522 MYTHS OF THE MESSIAH 


speaks is that from the verse Wherefore the light is come, and the glory of Yahweh is risen 
upon you (Isa. 60:1). Here the Messiah is mythically identified with the rising sun. The 
notion that all of the nations of the earth will walk in the light of the Messiah is found in 
the verse And nations shall walk by your light, kings, by your shining radiance (Isa. 60:3).

Pesikta Rabbati 36:2. 


669. GOD REPRIMANDS THE UNIVERSE 

In the time to come God will sit on His Throne of Justice and summon heaven and earth 
and say to them, "In the beginning of everything, I created you. How then could you 
look upon My Shekhinah removing Herself, My Temple being destroyed, and My chil- 
dren being banished among the nations of the world, and not entreat mercy on th ei r 
behalf?" Then He will reprimand heaven and earth. After that God will summon the sun 
and moon and reprimand them as well, along with the stars and planets. 

Then God will summon Metatron and say, "I gave you a name to be equal to Mine, as 
it is said, 'For My name is in him' (Exod. 25:21). How, then, could you look upon My 
Shekhinah removing Herself, My Temple being destroyed, and My children being ban- 
ished among the nations of the world, and not entreat mercy on their behalf?" 

After that God will summon the fathers of the world, to whom He will say, "I issued 
harsh decrees against your children, yet you asked for no mercy on their behalf. I made it 
plain to you from the very beginning that your children were to be banished, as it is said, 
'Know well that your offspring shall be strangers in a land not theirs'" (Gen. 15:13). So God will 
reproach the Fathers of the world. 

After that God will abolish the present order of the world, and then He will renew the 
heaven and the earth, as it is said. For behold! I am creating a new heaven and a new earth (Isa. 
65:17). 


Here God expresses anger that the other forces in the universe— heaven and earth, 
the sun, the moon, the stars, and the planets, Metatron and the patriarchs — did not 
strongly protest when God destroyed the Temple and sent the children of Israel into 
exile. This myth follows the tradition of God's regret for His actions. See, for example, 
"God Weeps Over the Destruction of the Temple," p. 38 and "God's Lament at the 
Western Wall," p. 39. Abraham bargained with God over the destruction of Sodom, 
here God reprimands those who might have similarly protested His actions concern- 
ing the Temple. 

This myth contradicts others in which the patriarchs do attempt to intervene with 
God. See "The Pleading of the Fathers," p. 515. 

Following these reprimands, God abolishes the present order of the world, and 
creates a new world, as is predicted to occur at the End of Days.

670. A NEW TORAH 

God is destined to give a new Torah to Israel at the hands of the Messiah, as it is said, "A 
new Torah shall come forth from Me" (Isa. 51:4). That new Torah will be written with 23 
letters in the alphabet. That extra letter had accompanied the other 22 from the first, but 
it had been invisible. With the addition of that letter, the letters of the Torah will combine 
in a different way, and new meanings will emerge. 



THE WARS OF 606 AND MA606 523 


Some say that the Messiah will clarify the words of that new Torah. Others say that 
Israel will not need the instructions of the Messiah in the days to come. Instead, they will 
receive instruction directly from God Himself. 

For God is destined to sit in the Garden of Eden and interpret the new Torah. All the 
righteous of the world will sit before Him, and all the household of heaven will stand on 
their feet. The sun, the planets, and the moon will be at God's right hand, and all the stars 
at His left. 

When God finishes teaching, everyone in the world will say, "Amen!" Even the wicked 
of Israel in Gehenna will all answer and say "Amen!" The sound of their words will be 
heard by God, and He will say, "What is that noise that I heard?" The angels will reply, 
"Those are the wicked of Israel in Gehenna." 

At that time God will take the keys to Gehenna and give them to Gabriel and Michael 
and say, "Go and open the gates of Gehenna and bring them up from there, as it is said. 
Open the gates" (Isa. 26:2). 

Then Gabriel and Michael will go at once and open the 40,000 gates of Gehenna and 
bring them up from Gehenna. They will take each one by the hand and raise him up as a 
man raises his fellow from a deep pit with a rope. 

Gabriel and Michael will then wash and care for and heal them from the wounds of 
Gehenna. They will dress them in beautiful garments, take them by the hand, and bring 
them before God. 

When they reach the gate of the Garden of Eden, Gabriel and Michael will enter first 
and God will say to them, "Permit them to come and see My glory!" And when they 
enter, wicked no longer, they will fall on their faces and prostrate themselves before God 
and bless and praise His holy name. 

So great is the transformation that will take place at the End of Days, that there will 
even be a new Torah — so suggests Alpha Beta de-Rabbi Akiva. It is not clear whether the 
"days to come" refers to the messianic era, when the resurrection of the dead will take 
place, or to the time after that. These are the two primary stages of the messianic era. 

The idea of the abrogation of the law at the time of the resurrection and the giving of 
the New Torah is found in the Talmud ( B . Nid. 61b). Louis Ginzberg dismisses any 
suggestion of Christian influence on this idea (An Unknown Jewish Sect , p. 213-214). 

The motif of the twenty-third letter of the Hebrew alphabet, which will remain 
invisible until the messianic era, recalls that which says the Torah was written with 
black fire on white fire, or that which speaks about the black letters and the white 
letters, in which the white spaces between the letters are also said to be an essential 
part of the text. An alternate version of this myth proposes that not a single letter will 
be added to the Torah or taken away; instead, the letters of the Torah will combine in 
a different way. For related myths about the new Torah that God will give to the Mes- 
siah, see "God Expounds the Torah," p. 36 and "The Messianic Torah," p. 509. See also 
"Creating New Heavens and a New Earth," p. 255.

APPENDIX A 
A NOTE ON THE SOURCES 

The sources of the myths drawn upon in this book include the full range of Jewish texts. 
These include texts that are both within accepted Jewish tradition (and therefore regarded 
by most Jews as "sacred") and those, primarily the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, that 
are outside that tradition. These texts include the Bible, as well as the rabbinic, kabbalistic, 
and hasidic texts, and a wide range of additional sources. The rabbinic texts consist of the 
Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds, which contain traditions that continued to evolve 
until about the end of the fifth century CE, plus the collections of rabbinic commentaries 
and legends known as the Midrash, compiled from about the third to at least the twelfth 
centuries CE. Each of the Talmuds contains the same core text, the Mishnah, and separate 
commentaries on it, known as the Gemara. To a large extent, rabbinic sources consist of 
commentary on the Hebrew Bible. Text and commentary are closely linked, and prooftexts — 
biblical verses — are offered in order to demonstrate the truth of an assertion. Even the 
pre-Christian translation of the Bible into Greek, known as the Septuagint, and early Jew- 
ish biblical translations into Aramaic, known as Targums, often reflect interpretations of a 
mythic nature. 

What we think of as mainstream Judaism is the Pharisaic/rabbinic reading of the bibli- 
cal tradition, which became normative Judaism after the fall of the Second Temple. The 
texts that are outside the mainstream are either early alternatives to the Pharisaic /rabbinic 
tradition, such as Samaritanism, the writings of the Qumran sectarians and the Enoch lit- 
erature, or rebellions against it, such as Karaism. 

The Jewish mystical tradition extends from the ancient period to the modem era. It in- 
cludes the Zohar* the primary kabbalistic text, edited (or perhaps written) in the thirteenth 
century, with especially important developments related to the teachings of Rabbi Isaac 
Luria of Safed in the sixteenth century. The primary Hasidic texts, beginning with the teach- 
ings of the Ba'al Shem Tov, and including other great Hasidic masters, such as Rabbi Levi 
Yitzhak of Berditchev and Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, date from the eighteenth to the 


*The Zohar itself claims to represent the theosophical discussions of a small group of mystically- 
minded sages in second century CE Palestine, the foremost of them being Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai. 
Gershom Scholem, following nineteenth century scholars like Heinrich Graetz, argued that the 
Zohar was a pseudepigraphic work written by Moshe de Leon in the thirteenth century, and Isaiah 
Tishby supported this view by pointing out words of Spanish origin in the text. More recently, 
Moshe Idel and Yehuda Liebes have argued that the text of the Zohar was compiled and edited by 
members of the kabbalistic circle to which de Leon belonged. A third view, suggested by Abraham 
Joshua Heschel and conveyed by Byron Sherwin, is that there were small circles of mystics in 
many generations, possibly going back as far as Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai, who studied privately 
and orally for hundreds of years, and traditions coming out of these mystical circles were drawn 
upon to compile the Zohar. According to Heschel, it is possible that some of these traditions, prob- 
ably the core traditions, are traceable back to Shimon bar Yohai. In that sense, bar Yohai may have 
been the initial author of the Zohar, and the teachings initiated in his mystical circle were passed 
down orally for hundreds of years until Moshe de Leon and his group decided they should be 
written down, possibly because of the upheaval in Spain at that time. This would indicate that 
some of the mystical motifs of the Zohar were not original to the thirteenth century, but may have 
been considerably more ancient. In Heschel's view, it was not possible that de Leon himself wrote 
the Zohar , for his other writings demonstrate that he did not have the necessary skill or imagina- 
tion. Instead, Heschel considered the possibility that while Moshe de Leon did not write the Zohar , 
he may have had a major hand in editing it. See "How the Zohar Was Written" by Yehuda Liebes in 
Studies in the Zohar , pp. 85-138.

526 A NOTE ON THE SOURCES 


twentieth centuries. Together the Bible, Talmuds, Midrash, kabbalistic and hasidic texts 
constitute a large part of the sacred teachings of Judaism. There are also many mythic frag- 
ments preserved in the early biblical translations, and in the many biblical commentaries 
written by some of the greatest rabbis of the medieval and early modem periods, from 
Rashi in the eleventh century, to Nachmanides in the thirteenth, to Rabbi Moshe Alshekh 
in tire sixteenth, and Rabbi Hayim ben Attar, known as the Or ha-Hayim, in the eighteenth. 

Outside the tradition are the texts of the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha. The Apocry- 
pha are ancient Jewish books found in the early Greek translation of the Bible (Septuagint) 
but absent from the Hebrew. Most of these books are treated as canonical by Catholics but 
not by Jews or Protestants. In addition, there is an enormous pseudepigraphal literature, 
that is, texts falsely attributed to biblical figures. These texts generally date from between 
200 bce and 200 ce and usually represent the teachings of a particular Jewish sect. It is 
possible that they were written in hope of being added to the Bible at some future time— 
but were not. Thus the texts of the Pseudepigrapha are those texts that the mainstream 
Jewish tradition repudiated; little effort was made to preserve them, and many exist only in 
translation into languages like Geez or Slavonic. Many of them show evidence of Christian 
interpolation. Nevertheless, these are important texts that often preserve Jewish myths not 
to be found anywhere else, and for this reason they have been recognized here as legiti- 
mate sources of Jewish mythology. Some of these long-lost texts were collected in the Apoc- 
rypha, but there are a great many others, as readers of James Charlesworth's Old Testament 
Pseudepigrapha will soon discover. This literature includes the post-Edenic lives of Adam 
and Eve, the books of Enoch, which describe the ascent of Enoch into heaven, and testa- 
ments of all the patriarchs and the 12 sons of Jacob — and much more. 

In addition, there is another category of writings, known as the Hekhalot texts, dating 
from around the second century CE to the eighth century, which describe heavenly jour- 
neys of great sages such as Rabbi Ishmael and Rabbi Akiba. There are also the Dead Sea 
Scrolls, which provide early versions of biblical material and some texts not found any- 
where else. The writings of the Samaritans, an early sect related to Judaism that refused to 
accept any books of the Bible except for the Pentateuch, have also been drawn upon, as 
well as those of the Karaites, who accepted the Tanakh, the entire Bible, but rejected the 
Talmud and other rabbinic traditions. All of these texts overflow with mythic motifs. There 
are even folktales with mythological motifs found among those collected in Eastern Eu- 
rope by S. Ansky from 1911-1914, and among the 20,000 tales collected by the Israel Folktale 
Archives (IFA) over the past 40 years. These are remarkable sources not only for folklore, 
but also for mythology, which has been preserved in an oral tradition that is still flourish- 
ing. Note that there are many texts inspired by the Bible that are not Jewish. These include 
Gnostic, Christian, and Muslim texts. Of the Gnostic texts unearthed at Nag Hammadi, 
some, such as On the Origin of the World, preserve traditions of Jewish origin. 

Although some folktales with strong mythic elements have been included in this book, 
it was not possible, for reasons of space, to include as many as might be wished. For this 
reason, the editor s prior collections of Jewish folklore, Elijah's Violin &amp; Other fewish Fairy 
Tales, Miriam's Tambourine: Jewish Tales from Around the World, Lilith's Cave: Jewish Tales of the 
Supernatural, and Gabriel s Palace: Jewish Mystical Tales, might be regarded as supplements to 
this book, as they include many examples of such mythical folktales. Where appropriate, 
reference to mythic tales from these books will be found in the commentaries. 

The structure of this book, focusing on the ten primary categories of Jewish mythol- 
ogy and organizing the entries in mythic cycles, inevitably results in placing all of these 
sources biblical, rabbinic, kabbalistic, hasidic, folk, and pseudepigraphal — side by side. 
Even though they are not regarded by all Jews as having equal value, they all grow out of 
the same mythical tradition. The individual myths, compiled from existing variants, are 
followed by commentaries and by sources. 



THE PRIMARY BIBLICAL MYTHS 527 


In general, the reader can assume that the biblical texts are by far the best known and 
most influential, while the texts drawn from the sacred sources represent the teachings 
of mainstream Judaism. The myths drawn from the Pseudepigrapha, while non- 
canonical, still represent authentic Jewish sources, and the variations they offer are 
often enlightening. 

Of course, all of these sources constitute an enormous library, of which the myths 
included in this book should be viewed as representative, not comprehensive. Here the 
words of Rabbi Meir ben Yitzhak Nehorai in the piyyut (liturgical poem) known as Akdamut 
come to mind: "If all the heavens were parchment, if all the trees were pens, if all the seas 
were ink, and if every creature were a scribe, they would not suffice to expound the 
greatness of God." 


APPENDIX B 

THE PRIMARY BIBLICAL MYTHS 


The earliest written examples of Jewish mythology are found in the Bible. For this rea- 
son, approximately thirty biblical excerpts have been included in this book, although 
they are, of course, available in any Bible. Readers may be surprised to find that many of 
the later Jewish myths are cut from the same cloth as the biblical myths. The following 
list includes both those biblical myths included here as well as some of those that it was 
not possible to include because of space limitations. Those that are included are noted 
with an asterisk. These biblical excerpts have been taken from Tanakh: A New Translation 
of the Holy Scriptures According to the Traditional Hebrew Text published by The Jewish Pub- 
lication Society.

THB MYTH OP JUDAIIM 


B B 


Th e first anthology of Jewish mythology in English, Tree of Souls reveals a mythical tradition as rich and as 
fascinating as any in the world. Drawing from the Bible, the Pseudepigrapha, the Talmud and Midrash, the 
kabbalistic literature, medieval folklore, Hasidic texts, and oral lore collected in the modern era, Schwartz 
has gathered together nearly 700 of the key Jewish myths. The myths themselves are marvelous. We read of 
Adam’s diamond and the Land of Eretz (where it is always dark), the fall of Lucifer and the quarrel of the sun 
2nd the moon, the Treasury of Souls and the Divine Chariot. We discover new tales about the great figures of 
the Hebrew Bible, from Adam to Moses; stories about God’s Bride, the Shekhinah, and the evil temptress, 
Lilith j plus many tales about angels and demons, spirits and vampires, giant beasts and the Golem. Equally 
important, Schwartz provides a wealth of additional information. For each myth, he includes extensive com- 
mentary, revealing the source of the myth and explaining how it relates to other Jewish myths as well as to 
world literature (for instance, comparing Eve s release of evil into the world with Pandora’s). For ease of use, 
Schwartz divides the volume into ten books, Myths of God, Myths of Creation, Myths of Heaven, Myths of 
Hell, Myths of the Holy Word, Myths of the Holy Time, Myths of the Holy People, Myths of the Holy Land, 
Myths of Exile, and Myths of the Messiah. 


"Master anthologizer Howard Schwartz builds on a spectrum of approaches in his latest collection, Tree of Souls. 
Like Sir James George Frazer in The Golden Bough , he organizes an international encyclopedic collection of 
tales under broad, evocative categories. Schwartz’s Herculean effort amalgamates a vast reference library of 
Jewish knowledge." -Debra Gash, Hadassah 


A resounding rebuttal to the old accusation that the Jews have no mythology. . . . This is that rare book that 
is both a fascinating read for the non-specialist and a turning point for scholarship.”
